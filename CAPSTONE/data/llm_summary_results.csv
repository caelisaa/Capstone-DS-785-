Room was very dated.  Definitely did not meet the expectations I have for a Hyatt property.   Lobby area was nice but rooms were very dated and appeared dirty.

"My fiancé and I booked the Hyatt in Green Bay, WI, because we had previously stayed at a Hyatt in Chicago, IL-- and loved it. We are very displeased with our stay in at the Hyatt, in WI, and will not be returning. 
Here are a few things, which have steered our stay to other locations moving forward.
1. The room was not clean. We arrived and paid for early check in-- yet got put in a room that had dust all over the place.
2. The tv had a burn mark. 
3. The carpet had a wrinkle in it, between the sliding door and bed, causing me to trip in the middle of the night. 
4. Went to look in the brochure to find the floor in which the laundry room was, and the brochure appeared to be half eaten by an animal-- therefore we had to call the lobby for them to tell us, what we should have been able to know without calling. That's the whole point of a brochure in a guest room. Very inconvenient. 
5. The view that we had was horrendous. Opening our curtains, to find we had a beautiful view of the AC units. 
6. We paid extra for the morning breakfast. Upon arrival, there was no host. We asked a server and she said ""seat yourself, and someone will come get your drinks."" We did just that. And 10 minutes went by. We had to get up not just once, but twice to get our drinks. That is terrible service and very  unacceptable. 

Like stated above, we will not be returning to the Hyatt Hotels. The many inconveniences and awful service in the dining area, have made up our mind, that we will in fact take our money elsewhere and stay where we feel we are appreciated.

Thank you, 

Dillon Jones","Dillon Jones shares their negative experience staying at the Hyatt Hotel in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Issues included a dirty room upon early check-in, damaged TV and carpet, lack of information in the brochure, poor view, and poor service during breakfast.

"Try having free coffee and breakfast for your guest. Before booking on travel, it said free breakfast and that's why we booked. We are busy and not have time for stopping another place for breakfast.  We travel a lot on business and use lot hotels around the country.

This incident has led them to decide against future stays at Hyatt properties.,Very Negative
"During the stay I was suffering with a cold. So to have a room that could not have the temperature changed was not well. The loudness of the room heater was loud and disrupted sleep most every time is cycled and eventually the first night I slept on the sofa. On the second night, when I arrived in the room, the heater unit would not shut down, running constantly. Contacted the front desk for assistance, and the only thing offered would be to completely shut it off. That night I simply closed to the bedroom area and slept again on the sofa. Finally in the morning the unit shut off. But the room was no where to be considered 'warm'.
Meals: used the morning breakfast buffet; the first morning I noticed that the scrambled eggs were just 'warm' at best. The hash browns were also on the cool side. Butter was very hard and made it a challenge to spread on the toast. The second morning I went for the hash browns, pancakes and bacon. The hash browns were past cool to being simply cold as were the pancakes which of course could not melt that rock hard butter. The bacon at best was barely warm. Coffee however was fine.
The Breakout Conference Hall was chilly and several attendees wore sweaters or jackets.
Nice looking, clean facility, but wasn't that warm fuzzy feeling. 
Upon check out, the desk clerk was gracious and provided a discount for the room and meal. Thank you for that.","During their stay, the guest suffered from a cold exacerbated by a noisy and disruptive room heater. Sleeping arrangements had to be adjusted multiple times due to issues with the heater. Meals at the hotel's breakfast buffet were consistently undercooked or served lukewarm, making them unenjoyable.

"Always a favorite place to stay in Green Bay. Room and 95 % of hotel looked immaculate. Sandwich/ wrap options in the snack bar or ""grab and go"" area could be brought up a notch.

"I was there for a conference. Was happy with the conference rate. 
Getting the reservation was a struggle. The third party lost my reservation and I had to scramble to get one. The ""on line"" process was awful.

"Parking is extremely inconvenient. Having to go back and forth from parking ramp rather than having a big enough lot is less than ideal. No idea of this until we got there and couldn’t find a spot.

Parking was very confusing.  In one area it was complimentary but there wasnt enough for everyone.  If you offer free parking to some guests it should be offered to all.

"We were staying on points for one night. My pet peeve is when I stay on points at a hotel being given the worst room - because I’m staying on points. I have a lot of hotel stays throughout the year both for business or pleasure across different hotel brands. We were put right outside the elevator for our recent stay, it was unbelievably loud at night with us being able to hear every word of the elevator conversations. And, because there were 3 of us - not everyone could sleep in the room behind the door - we had people on the sofa bed who had the worst sleep ever with all the noise. When I was being checked in there was actually discussion about if the sofa bed was needed and how many beds were needed, so I was pretty annoyed to find we were out right outside the elevator doors.","During a hotel stay using points, the speaker experienced poor accommodation due to placement near the elevator, resulting in disruptive noise levels and uncomfortable sleeping arrangements for multiple guests.

"1. We were on the 2nd floor facing main street - loud and loud. The room did not stop the traffic noise at all. It was super frustrating to be awake at midnight due to the noise. 
2. The lounge/restaurant was out of limes. Who runs out of limes? They also did not have ginger beer to make Moscow Mules.   Odd for being a bar/lounge in Wisconsin.
3. While the front desk staff was nice - there was no mention of any kind about being a World of Hyatt member which I thought upon check in was supposed to occur. I felt I received nothing on this visit for being a World member.
4. The room smell - I mentioned my dis-satisfaction to the front desk upon check out - no real concern about it. Trust me - it should be concerning. I had to wash every piece of clothes in all suitcases as the clothes picked up that smell from just 1 night. 
5. I can say the poo/hot tub/sauna and steam room were great - no issues

In summary, I personally will not make the Hyatt my top option when visiting Green Bay. The thought of the room smell alone makes me shy away from staying again. Too bad - we love the appearance of the lobby and the pool area.","The guest experienced frustration due to excessive noise in their room on the second floor of a Hyatt hotel in Green Bay, Wisconsin. They were disappointed by the lack of essential ingredients for cocktails (limes, ginger beer) at the bar/lounge, and felt unacknowledged as a World of Hyatt member during their stay.

"my only complaint is when I had to move to a different room at 1am due to someone smoking in another room, filling my room with nasty cigarette smoke.  The move went very smooth and security was nice enough about it.  Under the circumstances, I would have thought that I would have received a discount on my room so I was definitely disappointed.  I hope they were able to find the guy (I'm sure it was one of the guys that was on the bowling league, since I saw him earlier in the lobby with a cigarette)
Putting that aside, the staff was fantastic during the unfortunate weather we were all dealing with.  With food being limited and staff that couldn't make it in, those that were there did a fantastic job and should all be commended!","The speaker experienced inconvenience due to secondhand smoke in their room late at night, which required them to relocate.
