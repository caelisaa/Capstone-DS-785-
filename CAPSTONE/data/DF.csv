The roll a way and hideaway bed mattress were terrible in this room.  Hideaway was broke down   Rollaway was a box with springs sticking through it. Other wise hotel and staff superb,Negative,,,v,,
This is our favorite hotel in all our travels. When we retire we plan on using the hotel much more. Thank you.,Positive,v,,,,
The staff were awesome,Positive,v,,,,
"The room was not as clean as it has been in the past. There were areas that needed dusting, and there were smears on the Windows.",Negative,,,,v,
Comfortable beds & Pillows - slept great.,Positive,v,,,,
"Couple of items, the temperature in our room, 832, would not warm up, it was around 67 deg the entire stay. The fan ran constantly and was fairly loud. I did not mention during our stay because I didnâ€™t want the hassle of someone in and out of our room, and or having to change rooms. The next was a leak in the main roof outside of our room in the corner of the courtyard near room 832, water was dripping pretty fast. This did not effect us as it was outside our room but not a great look for the hotel. We did the buffet, the food was very mediocre, i thought the potatoes were cold and greasy. The omlettes and fruit were good. It took quite a while to get our bill even though it was it not overly crowded. if we stay here again we will not eat the buffet. As long as I am filling this out I will mention the parking, validating the parking all the time is a pain, canâ€™t it somehow be piggyback with the room key.",Negative,,,,,v
"The food in the restaurant was over salted, under cooked and some of it was cold. We waited for more than an hour to be served once our order was placed. The staff was nice and the manager came out and apologized but never once did he ever offer us any sort of compensation. Maybe a free dessert or drinks or even a % off the bill.  Unsatisfactory, will not eat there again, they have lost our service for stays in the future.",Negative,,,,,v
"We ordered room service - which we rarely do.  When we checked out, we were surprised there was a $13.19 buffet charge on our $43.80 breakfast room service bill (for which we had a receipt).  Not sure if someone erroneously charged a buffet meal to our room or ???  It was corrected, but in the future we probably won't put our credit card on file for ""incidentals"" to avoid this.  Also, hoping the room we were in will get its table back.  Was awkward to eat without it.",Negative,,,,v,
Disappointed that someone knocked on our door Christmas morning @ 8:06 am to clean room. We told them to come back. Then we also told the front desk attendant that we would like our room cleaned while we were out for a good 7 hours from 11AM to 6 PM. We came back to an unattended room.   We checked in on Sunday before Christmas  and left Wednesday after Christmas .,Negative,,,,v,
I was so happy you let dogs stay!  My dog is cleaner than my infant and think $100 per stay is still too much.,Neutral,,,v,,
"Wonderful stay!  We stopped in the bar our first night and it was pretty dead in there (right before Christmas), but the bartender was awesome and we all watched Elf together :)
The room was great as usual, just like I remembered from my childhood, but updated!
We didn't have the breakfast there because it's a bit different than we remembered.  It's now an additional charge to the room and the set up is different.  I'm sure it's tasty but we opted out of it.",Positive,v,,,,
I wasnâ€™t notified about $7 parking fee until check in. Couldnâ€™t find anything about it on website nor was the info provided when making the reservation. This is first experience Iâ€™ve had with any hotel where they werenâ€™t upfront about parking costs online and during reservation process.,Negative,,,,,v
"We specifically asked at check in what time breakfast was served and the desk person said 7 am to 10 am.  We got to the buffet at 9:30 the next morning and we're told it cloed at 9:30 and they would not serve us.  When I complained at checkout the girl at the desk said, ""I'm sorry about that.  Our breakfast is really good!"". Not pleased with the misinformation and the response I got.",Negative,,,,v,
Great room.,Positive,v,,,,
Our favorite hotel in Green Bay. We have stayed here more than any hotel we've ever frequented. It has everything we need and is in close proximity to everything we want to do.,Positive,v,,,,
Will be staying again 12/28/18  Could use 2 extra pillows.. We are big pillow people.. usually other places have 2 extra tucked away in closet. But not here.. All else good.. See you on the 28th..;)  And did not show up on bed bug list...  Important..,Neutral,,,v,,
"Our visit  was an annual family Christmas stay, a big splurge for us!  Everyone enjoys the comforts of the Hyatt. Unfortunately this year the hot tub was cold and did not get to enjoy it. One of the big things looked forward to using during our stay.",Negative,,,,v,
"Thanks.  Biggest issue I had was that my room was immediately off the elevator bank.  Because the elevators still have the old fashioned bell/ding when selecting the floor in the elevator and audible from the elevator lobby, I was constantly hearing it in my room as well.  I could even hear it from the bedroom.  Isn't there a way to upgrade the notifier system to use a more discreet or subtle ring?",Negative,,,,v,
Great location and wonderful spacious rooms.,Positive,v,,,,
"upgrading to higher, elongated toilets would be a great upgrade in the bathrooms",Neutral,,,v,,
"Incredible room for the money! Nice perks in the room, too. Only complaint would be wish staff would have understood more about what they offered for breakfast. Was disappointed at the lack of a continental breakfast.",Positive,,v,,,
"This was the worst stay I have ever had!  Room 330 should not be available to your guests! Also who ever was at the front desk on the night of 12/14/18 and 12/15/18 early morning should be fired. The noise in the main hotel area went on until 11:30 that night and the outside noise until 2:00 am. I understand this is Green Bay were most people don't have a clue! But really, this is a Hyatt Regency!",Negative,,,,,v
The choice of TV stations was lacking....,Negative,,,,v,
"Our room was clean, comfortable........very happy with our room.",Positive,v,,,,
"The temperature of the hot tub needs to be turned up, other that that, we were pleased with everything else.",Neutral,,,v,,
"check in staff was great, place was beautiful.  Check in staff did tell us to bring parking ticket in to get validated, told her we left it in car, she said we needed it, so the next morning we went to the car and brought it in, waited in line for same girl to tell us we didn't need to validate on the weekend, so that is one area that could be improved, all told about a 20 minute waste of time.   Room was great, nice set up.  Upon walking in the first thing we saw was a dirty cleaning rag left over the chair back.  There was also urine on the bottom of the toilet on the side, but otherwise clean.",Negative,,,,v,
The customer service staff are very friendly during check-in. Lindsay has been extremely helpful for all of my stays this year when booking my rooms.  Very accommodating when changes needed to be made. Emma has been very helpful with my room requests as well.  She really does well.,Positive,v,,,,
"Great spot. A bit of a ""seasoned"" property but it is well maintained. Parking and validation could improve by using the door key as the in/ out ticket.",Positive,,,v,,
Why no coffee anywhere in the hotel until after 7:00 on a Saturday morning?,Negative,,,,v,
The hotel was dark and cold and very dated. I could not believe this was a Hyatt property. Even the lobby was cold.,Negative,,,,v,
"As a business hotel with corporate rates would be awesome to have breakfast before 6:30 am, but otherwise the prices of the market was reasonable though maybe a coupon to those who check it before breakfast which is included in the rate would be appreciated.",Positive,,,v,,
"Great service, great staff, great stay!",Positive,v,,,,
"Room service food options were very limited at dinner time. I have both gluten and dairy issues - leaving little to chose from.  Knowing 333 has more to offer, it would be great if the room service delivery could reflect more of those offerings.",Positive,,,,v,
lovely hotel..staff was awesome!!! I would definitely stay there again..love the place..thx,Positive,v,,,,
Prompt room service and courteous front desk.,Positive,v,,,,
very welcomed and treated well,Positive,v,,,,
My favorite place to stay when in the Green Bay area.,Positive,v,,,,
Nice Hotel.  But the common area was loud.  Which was surprising since the hotel seemed empty.  Again no offer for an upgrade at this property for Globalist.  In fact my Bedroom TV wasn't even the typical large TV.  It was like a Computer Monitor.  Just surprised I never get an offer at this property.  Free Parking was nice and the Breakfast was good as well.,Positive,,,v,,
"I made the reservation for Wednesday 12-5 showed up on 12-5 and the check in said I was a NO SHOW last night 12-4. I said sorry the reservation was for 12-5 not 12-4. He indicated he corrected the Hyatt system and I would not be charged for the 12-4 no show. As I checked out I was charged for the NO SHOW and the 12-5 night I stayed. I had to go through the entire process all over again and will be looking for the credit on my account.

The buffet breakfast was the WORST I have experienced in a long time. Bad eggs, Bad cereal selections, un ripe fruit bad service, stale bread. A Very lame attempt at breakfast.",Negative,,,,,v
Wonderful stay - excellent accommodations and stellar service!,Positive,v,,,,
"Cleanliness room can be improved, Bathroom floor specifically had hair.",Positive,,,,v,
The price of the breakfast and the charge for parking were surprisingly high.  I would have expected the hotel to validate parking at least.,Positive,,,,v,
Almost everything was great. The room was spacious and well appointed. The only issue we had was with the temperature. When we got to the room it was 72 degrees so I tried to turn it down to 65. After about a hour my husband looked at the thermostat and it was at 74 so it was going up instead of down. We called the front desk and were told that they would have to contact the engineers to turn the heat off to our room and they gave us a fan. I assumed that it would be taken care of the next day but no luck. Thankfully the fan was large and did the job while we were sleeping!,Positive,,v,,,
"Bed could be a little more comfortable. And, need real refrigerators, not these 45 degree â€œcoolersâ€",Positive,,v,,,
"I am a huge fan of this hotel and have stayed here(GB Hyatt)  about 15 nights in the past 1 - 2 years. I am usually very impress overall, but this time was not my best experience. The hotel was not very busy and parking lot nearly empty for my entire stay. I was checked in to a room with construction going on right above me and I heard a lot of construction noise early and throughout the day as I was working.  There was also a blue crane that was extended right in front of my window.  Since there was hardly anyone in the hotel I was surprised they put me in this room. I didn't ask to be moved.  The carpet in my room was buckling and needs to be stretched.  The staff in the restaurant (breakfast) was also ignoring the guests as they stood at the front and talked.  I had to get up and ask for a menu, got to them to ask for water, then a refill and then go up and ask for my bill.  My eggs were also under cooked (ordered poached medium- no issue with them being under cooked, that happens and is not big deal) and I waited for someone to come and see how things were so I could reorder, but no one ever did (that was the issue-poor service). Each time I went up to ask for service the young ladies were very nice, but they clearly were more interested in talking to each other than in taking care of the guests. The person at the front desk (the one that checked me out for my stay) also needs to work on her customer service.  I saw her a few times during my stay and she never smiles, says hello or greets the guests, didn't ask how my stay was, etc  She was very cold and not very friendly and not typical of the Hyatt Staff I have net over the course of my stays.  I'm hoping this is not her usual demeanor and she was just ""off"".  
Like I said earlier, I am a huge fan of the hotel and am only sharing this for constructive purposes.  In general my hop is that the GB Hyatt is not slipping and that on my next stay the service will be improved. 

Thank you.",Positive,,,,v,
The rooms and bathrooms need updating.,Neutral,,,v,,
"Great room, enjoyed the stay.",Positive,v,,,,
Initial check-in went very smoothly and the receptionist at the desk was very accommodating.,Positive,v,,,,
The towel holder hook was broken and we couldnâ€™t use it.  Otherwise everything else was great!,Negative,,v,,,
Needs updating. Hardly seemed like a Hyatt at all. Was not informed of parking fee in advance. Seems like 2nd rate hotel at best.,Positive,,,,v,
Emma Asst Front Desk Mgr did a great job accommodating my wife and I during a recent 5 day stay!,Positive,v,,,,
"Hotel was outdated but obviously they were working on that. Staff couldn't have cared less about our stay. Mumbled a lot. I was looking for a late night snack for my wife that wasn't feeling well. Just some pretzels. Found some at the market by the front desk. $2.10 for a 1 ounce .50 bag of pretzels. Wow! 1 ounce of pretzels. I was going to get 2, but when I heard the cost,  I said I can't pay that for a little bag of pretzels, i got no response from the hostess. She didn't even look up from the computer screen. I know she can't change prices, but even a ""I'm sorry"" would have been better than complete indifference. The nakeup of the hotel was good, so with some updating and a staff that cares, the potential is there.",Positive,,,,v,
"The hotel room was excellent and the staff was very friendly.  Met friends from out of town and we were very pleased with our overall stay and proximity to walking to events.  The parking was not a big deal although I think that should have been explained when booking. Breakfast was good however, I feel there should be an inclusion with price of room.  Overall stay was A+ and would stay again.",Positive,v,,,,
"In my opinion the staff was very friendly, although they did not ask if I wanted to pay cash or put on my card I had on account.. Housekeeping was great! But you need to hire 2-4 men to move those couches and clean underneath them.  And the mattress on the fold out bed could be replaced it sages.",Positive,,,v,,
Bar serves Wine opened 3 days ago and is awful. Asked for fresh bottle and still got 3 day old stuff. Paying big bucks per glass and deserve a fresh bottle rather than old wine getting pawned off.,Positive,,,,v,
Great hotel. Window blinds need to be closer to the wall as a lot of light into the room. Staff was very welcoming. Sofa bed mattress could be better or a better cover to add on. Would stay again!,Positive,,v,,,
The breakfast buffet omelet station was terrible.  Not sure who the cook was but I would never go back to him again.,Negative,,,,,v
The gentleman that drives the shuttle is very kind!,Positive,v,,,,
Need to get parking fixed. Gates only work half of the time,Positive,,,,v,
They forgot to clean my room one day.,Positive,,,,,v
"Everyone at the hotel was very nice and most of our room were very good. The part that was really disgusted was that the comforter on the pull-out couch was rolled in a ball inside the couch and soiled with urine and feces. It was absolutely vile and it ruined our stay at your hotel. We left a note for housekeeping to replace it, which they did, but it was hard to get past.",Negative,,,,v,
"The exterior of the hotel is not inviting - and the inside is dark.  All of the staff were very warm and welcoming!  The room is nice; however, needs some updating.  The doors on the inside of the room are very outdated and worn for wear.  The counters and bathroom updates are very nice.  Maybe consider more uplifting colors other than dark brown.  I did feel safe and relaxed here and that is very important, thank you!",Positive,,,v,,
Parking charges are difficult to find on the site.  The $7 per day charge is unreasonable for green bay.  Had problems with the gate system every time I left the hotel.  Lobby reeked of smoke due to large group of smokers right outside the door.  Will not be back,Negative,,,,v,
"Our whole stay was phenomenal.  We experienced Teresa at the restaurant two different time, both of which were top notch!  Excellent service from start to finish for our entire stay!",Positive,v,,,,
"Air Conditions too loud. 
Furniture for a Hyatt Hotel too shabby",Negative,,,,v,
Love it staff is fabulous,Positive,v,,,,
The reason for 5 under customer service is that I requested a couple of days ago that Hyatt ships a laptop charger that I forgot in my room when I checked out...  They promised to make arrangements but nothing precipitated thus far...  Guess I'll have to call and inquire again... Not good.,Positive,,,,v,
"First thing my wife does upon entering any hotel is to pull the sheets back.  Crawling around under the top sheet near the headboard were two ants; my wife freaked out; after I disposed of them I volunteered to take that bed.  She took the other queen, but not until she removed all bedding and inspected first.
Very creepy to find ants in the bed; and for $300 + , and no breakfast included. Really?
Room 234",Negative,,,,v,
"I've stayed in much nicer areas in more expensive locations for a fraction of the cost. It's JUST Green Bay over looking a parking lot, it's not worth the $$. LA-cheaper, Las Vegas- Cheaper, Niagara Falls-cheaper, Ocean view on a mountain side in northern Washington-cheaper! and that's JUST the US...

Other than the over priced room, the hotel was clean, comfortable, and the staff was very nice.",Positive,,,,,v
"I booked this stay with my Hyatt points so this was an award night but I was very disappointed with the condition of our room.  I sat down to take it easy and watch tv however there was no picture only sound on the set.  I then decided to brew a cup of coffee and found that the bar sink faucet was plugged up so no water there.  My wife came out shortly from the bathroom and told me the drain was nearly plugged.  We could barely look out the sliding glass door in the bedroom since the inner seal was obviously broken and the glass was fogged between the glass panels.  Not what I expected from a luxury hotel!  The staff was pleasant but instead of addressing the issues, only told me I should have said something earlier.  Wish I had saved my points and stayed elsewhere.",Positive,,,,,v
"The hotel was under construction. The shuttle was not available during my stay, except for the last day and had to incur additional unplanned expense because it was not available. I thought breakfast was included with our corporate rate, and learned it was not. On a positive note, my bed was EXTREMELY comfortable and the TVs in my room exceeded my expectations (the large-screen in the bedroom was wonderful!)",Positive,,,,v,
The stairs in the convention center are rather steep.  Escalator would have been nicer.,Positive,,,v,,
"We had great discussions with many of the staff throughout our stay! We met some of the cooks, Miguel, Steve and Manny who were a delight. Bill was setting up for a lunch and even started conversation with us. Linda a housekeeper was kind. Stacey in the pub entertained us since we were the only one in there on a Sunday night. Every staff member we met was amazing! Checking was smooth, the hotel is gorgeous. The mattresses and pillows were so comfortable to sleep on. I definitely will recommend Hyatt to friends, family and coworkers.",Positive,v,,,,
"I was going to speak with someone the morning I checked out but there was a line of people.  My room was FREEZING.  The thermometer didn't work and I had the heat turned up to 76 and froze.  I was in room 330 and didn't sleep all night due to the fact that I was freezing.  I used the extra blanket and in the middle of the night got up and put bath towels on me.  I was desperate and probably should've called down for another blanket.  I felt that the room was very outdated and dirty.  But that I can live with...the freezing cold was rough.  Needless to say, I got a horrible night sleep and checked out at 8 in the morning.",Negative,,,,v,
Check out was slow because of the parking ticket..had to stand in a long line to get it validated,Positive,,,,v,
We were very pleased with our stay and room at the Hyatt Regency and would stay again when in the area. The Hotel was lovely and our room was very comfortable and had all the extras we have not experienced at other hotels. The value for the price we paid was outstanding compared to other hotels we have stayed that are considered high end. Absolutely satisfied with the Hyatt Regency!,Positive,v,,,,
"I love the set up of the room, how you walk into the living space first, then the bathroom, then the bedroom. I wish more hotels did this",Positive,v,,,,
"The guest rooms were much too hot, and the windows/sliding door should have had screens. The free breakfast was sorely missed. The elevators are extremely slow. The room keys kept inactivating.",Negative,,,,v,
"We expected a 3 pm check in, and our rooms weren't ready until 6:30. We would like a partial refund.",Positive,,,,v,
"There seemed to be a motor running - a very loud one, that was not coming from inside the room.  It would kick in every few minutes and run for about 15-30 seconds.  I thought it was maybe the elevator room nearby, but that also did not seem to be the case.  Either way, it did not make for a very tranquil stay.",Positive,,,,v,
"I was there for a wedding. Check-in went very smooth and told me that I was able to stay in the room for both nights. I got a call on Saturday while I was in the middle of setting up a wedding upstairs and was told I had to move rooms. It was a very inconvenient time and I could not move rooms. The wedding was less than an hour away and I had my hotel room filled. I was able to stay in the room but thought it was a very bad time for them to do that. 
It was impossible to have breakfast downstairs with any larger wedding group.  they didn't have the room for us and kept letting other people in ahead of us so we had to wait well over half an hour for all of us to eat. 
On the positive side it is a gorgeous location, staff was as friendly and accommodating as possible, very clean and we would stay again.",Positive,,,,v,
I decided to stay here with some friends for a night away. I decided to use points for the room. I feel it was a wasted because there were so many issues with my stay!,Negative,,,,v,
"I felt bad for the staff. We arrived around 3 wanting to rest before the evening but a room was not available yet. So we went to the bar. At 4 there was still no room, at 5 still no room. We had a scheduled dinner so we got ready in the bathroom for the evening and had our bags held. Later that evening there was a room and it was a suite - very nice thank you. Most of the staff was very courteous.",Positive,,v,,,
"Housekeeping staff were excellent.  Front Desk was nice, and maybe new (?), but a little bureaucratic.  Overall, very happy.  Thank you for asking.",Positive,,v,,,
"I was there 3 days, I had an issue with the heat. They came up the next day and fixed the thermostat but the heat still did not work. Called the desk, they shut off the fan but never sent anyone to fix the heat. It was 66 degrees all three days. Staff just blew it off saying the hotel was cold. Disappointed.",Negative,,,,v,
"I've stayed at this hotel a number of times over the past twenty years.  A fresh coat of paint and a new tv isn't a renovation.  I only stay because of the KI Conv Center, there are many better options in Green Bay.",Positive,,,,v,
"I used the coffee maker, The coffee supply was replenished every day but the sugar and stir sticks were not.  A little thing but important to me.",Positive,,,v,,
The sleeping rooms have severely aged.  The food was average and the prices for drinks in the bar were extremely high.  GB is not Milwaukee or Minneapolis.,Positive,,,v,,
"As a breastfeeding mother staying at the Hyatt for a conference, I was extremely disappointed in the lack of accommodation. When I went to check in (earlier than the actual check in time) I explained that I would like a space to pump before my room was ready. I was told there were no options unless I paid an upgrade fee. This was not a feasible option. No private space was provided to me so I had to pump on the bathroom floor in a handicap stall. I do believe I could've been provided with a private space to pump and that accommodation was not made. I was incredibly upset at this situation.",Negative,,,,v,
Elevators were slow and bathrooms are way to small,Negative,,,v,,
I had a reservation for a room with two queen beds and tried to check in at 3:30 when check in is supposed to be 3:00.  I was informed that my room was not ready.  At 4:30 I went back up and they offered me a room with 1 king bed.  I declined. I went up again at 5:40 and was told it was ready only to find out it was the room with 1 king bed.  There was no compensation for the late check in or the wrong room.  I would not go back even though the room was nice and breakfast was good.,Positive,,,,v,
Hotel room was not ready until 5:30.,Positive,,,v,,
Some guests were disappointed with the Banquet dinner.,Positive,,,v,,
"I had a room reserved a month in advance for the wrestling clinic.  I, and 3 other coaches, tried checking in at 1 pm, but the room wasn't ready, 3 pm, the room wan't ready, 4:30 pm, the room wasn't ready...  We had a banquet to attend at 7 pm upstairs.  The 4 of us hadn't showered, etc... The 4 of us dressed in the bathroom!  I went to the desk at 7 pm, and was told by the clerk""your room is ready"", ""didn't someone text you?"".  

This was the WORST experience have ever had at a motel!  I would like you to forward this survey to a Manager, and I would also request I be reimbursed for my stay at the Hyatt.

"Room was not ready until 4pm arrived at 2. The breakfast food was cold and inedible, pull out bef was dirty and stained and very uncomfortable to the point it was better to sleep on the floor.",Positive,,,,v,
Great walleye at the restaurant!,Positive,v,,,,
"Room did not have full length mirror. Room service delivered in bag with plastic utensils. I was charged close to $10 for tip and service charge and I don't get real utensils? That is tacky. Internet connection impossible. Upon arrival was not informed of which elevator to use, or breakfast options. Morning staff was much more helpful with my need for local directions. Compared to my stay last year, I was disappointed",Negative,,,,v,
"Room was way too warm and thermostat didn't respond to any changes.  I am not able to sleep in 70-72 degrees comfortably.  I have stayed at this hotel many times over the years and this never seems to change.
I was also disappointed that the breakfast wasn't included in our room rate.  I later found out I could stay at the neighboring hotel cheaper, with working thermostats and has breakfast included so I will probably stay there next time.",Positive,,,,v,
Excellent service provided by staff. Morning breakfast is too good. I definitely recommend this hotel and would love to visit again.,Positive,v,,,,

"It's very sad that you would knowingly put someone in a room that is consistently loud!  There is also no control over the temperature as it was very warm in our room.  I will go out of my way to never stay at another Hyatt...aot of money for a very awful night.  When we checked out the rep asked us about your stay and when we mentioned how loud our night was, she replied oh yeah that is a loud room.  No I'm sorry, nothing.",Negative,,,,v,
"The staff was helpful and very friendly. The room was clean. The only issue I had is the heat didnâ€™t seem to work.  It didnâ€™t matter what the thermostat was set at, it was very cold in the room. I had to layer 2 blankets just to stay warm while I was sleeping. Also, the sink was draining very slow to the point where it almost overflowed while I was washing my face.",Positive,,,v,,
"Overall, the stay and accommodations were reasonable. However, a couple of items did stick out as unreasonable. The sheet set on the bed had a dime-sized hole in the fitted sheet right as I pulled the duvet back off the pillows. Also, all 4 of the pillows on the bed had hair on them - some long, possibly female hairs and some shorter. I was not going to sleep on someone else's hairy pillows. The spare in the linen closet was acceptable and so I used that one. I did not alert management to these issues immediately as I found reasonable solutions and was extremely tired due to a long travel day. I used points + cash for the room and was not completely satisfied. I will continue to stay as long as the accommodations improve. I had not had any prior poor experience to date.",Positive,,,,v,
"The down pillows are very uncomfortable, and the HVAC did not work in our room but we didnâ€™t report it.",Neutral,,,,v,

Charged us seven dollars a day for parking. We stayed at the hotel we were not gas or using the convention center. I was told that we were being charged seven dollars a day during check-in. I wish I was aware of this before we made arrangements to stay here. I have never been charged anywhere else for parking,Positive,,,,v,
"I'll be honest, I had no idea what to expect other than hearing that Hyatt has really stepped up their game with their new World Of Hyatt program and the addition of newer luxury properties it has acquired.  I travel a lot for work and this instance happened to be for pleasure.  Having switched my loyalty over to Hyatt recently from Marriott (and switched to the World Of Hyatt credit card), I was excited for this visit.

The gentleman who checked me into our hotel was FANTASTIC.  He welcomed us and our loyalty, and asked if I had any questions or needed anything additional for our stay.  Our room was in great condition and clean (except for the to-go container still in the garbage from a previous guest).

Unfortunately, the following morning the customer service experience was not quite the same.  I asked if I could take advantage of late-check out, basically looking for an extra hour as we were planning our day and thought at 12pm checkout was reasonable - especially since 2pm late checkout is a status benefit (which I understand is subject to availability).  When I called, the front desk person gave me a firm ""NO"", saying they had many guests arriving later in the day.  I totally understood, but she could have been a little more sincere and used a nicer tone after my request.

I'd definitely stay here again, as a first timer after switching my business to Hyatt I am impressed with the program, and the properties so far.  Just wish the customer service was a *tad* more polite in the morning hours :)",Positive,v,,,,
"When I checked in I was told I had booked a 2 queen bed room and if I wanted a king I would have to pay extra. Only after I provided hard copy of my confirmation did they acknowledge I had booked a king suite. Hotel was filled with drunken teachers, very noisy and 2 fire alarms were pulled ( very disturbing). Charged $7 to park despite no mention of it on the web site or my confirmation. I had stayed at hotel twice before and was never charged for parking.",Negative,,,,v,
"Rooms are big (nice) but if youâ€™re on the sleeper sofa itâ€™s so loud from the door you canâ€™t sleep.

Your hotel is certainly not up to Hyatt standards. Room 407 was filthy and so run down. Very sad to say the least....,Negative,,,,,v
The bathroom doors are water damaged. I saw multiple with our group. That was the only issue.,Negative,,,,v,

Glenn, the shuttle driver, was outstanding.

I would highly recommend this hotel.",Positive,v,,,,
The lack of a WSJ is really disappointing and detracts from the overall experience. Every other Hyatt Regency and even most Hyatt Places carry it. Iâ€™m a guest in your town. Trying to find a paper on my own is a huge hassle.,Positive,,,,v,

Otherwise, the accommodations were beyond my expectations.",Positive,,,,v,
Great service in the restaurant and bar.,Positive,v,,,,
very good staff,Positive,v,,,,
"The room temp was 72 degrees which is way too hot for sleeping.  Can you put some directions up that tell you how to decrease or increase temp?  Nothing we tried helped and it was late so we didn't want to bother anyone.  The balcony door wouldn't open so we could cool off either.  Other than that, things were good!",Positive,,,v,,
For the cost of the hotel...was not expecting to be charged again for parking on premise...have stayed in places for less (and less nice) that comped or included your parking...not added it on to the final bill.,Positive,,,,v,
"Awesome experience; the wedding reception of our niece was so well done, made the experience so memorable.  Appreciate the discounted cost of the breakfast buffet for the little children who don't eat that much.  Hotel much nicer than when it was embassy suites.",Positive,v,,,,

"The refrig in the room, said its only a cooler 45 degrees, which is not cold enough, should be 41 or less, front desk said it was fine, i did not take a temp, but I am a health inspector and it did not feel cold enough.  Fortunately I have family that lives close by to keep our food.  This is a Hyatt when they say there is a refrig I  expect it to maintain temperature.",Positive,,,,v,

"We arrived in our room and it was 72 degrees. We thought we turned down the thermostat and returned 3 hours later for it to be at 72 degrees. Called front desk and she told me to turn up the temp in room or open window or they could bring up a fan.  Turned up therm it just went to 74 so we had to open window. Was not pleased to have to sleep with a window open for 3 nights with cold breeze blowing in window along with traffic.  Very poor answer, I find that many people I talked to while staying there said it was way to warm.",Positive,,,,v,
"bathroom doors were really scratched up, needing paint",Negative,,,,v,
All employees were extremely caring and helpful. They answered any questions we had and went out of their way to be courteous. Wish all hotel staff were this wonderful in other parts of the country!,Positive,v,,,,
"My room was cold. I was given a little heater, about the size of a coffee pot, to keep  my room warm. That wasnâ€™t enough!
With having that heater on, when I turned on the hair dryer the breaker kicked and I had no lights! 
The same guy was at my room 3 times for these issues. 
I was told this is a common problem, people leave because it is too cold! 
Obviously no one really gives a shit! Nothing is done about it!",Negative,,,,,v
"The room was very cold 66, they gave me a space heater for the room. It was the size of a football. They said they couldnâ€™t turn on the heat because it was set for the season.

Staff was fantastic and very friendly!,Positive,v,,,,
Your pillows are horrible and too hard a mattress.,Negative,,,,v,
"The staff was very accommodating, and polite. The Romance package needs alot of work though.  The package says truffles and they were more like Hershey candy, the bottle of champagne was super cheap and can be bought at the store for 3.00. Also the champagne should be chilled on ice when served and should be brought to.the room as soon as the guests are checking in not 2 hours later. 
The breakfast was pretty good but not alot of options.  
Only other downfall is I would like to see some jacuzzis added to some of the rooms. Would really enhance a romance package.",Positive,,v,,,
"Beds in our room were not very comfortable--they were hard and you could feel the wires through the top.
For as much as it costs, it should at a minimum, include a complimentary breakfast and a happy hour.. When it was owned and operated by Embassy Suites, it provided those perks.",Positive,,,,v,
"This location is certainly not up to the Hyatt name.  Bathroom was aged, worn and not especially clean.
The bathroom door was scratched and  seemed like an animal was locked in and trying to escape.  I don't understand the charge for parking.  Unrealistic for this location.  No breakfast was included in room price.",Positive,,,,v,
I was very impressed with my overall stay.  I have stayed at this site 6-10 times over 20 years and everything seems even better than 20 years ago.  Way to go!,Positive,v,,,,
"My room was very nice; however, it was TOO HOT!  And unfortunately, the thermostats in the room don't really change the temperature - apparently.  We asked if someone could adjust it but I didn't notice a difference so we ended up sleeping with the sliding door open to get some cooler air.  Everything else was great!",Negative,,v,,,
The morning breakfast out in the general area resonated into room (plates clanging).,Positive,,,,v,
there was no toilet paper in room except the last little bit of a role and had to call at 2am for more and also the water bottle in our room was already drank out of or refilled not sure. i hope our room was cleaned before we came.,Positive,,,,v,

"Lindsay, Carrie, and Emma are always great to work with when I need to make reservations or a room request.  They are very prompt to respond and friendly to work with.",Positive,,,,,
No parking in lot during late check in - confusion by front desk as to validating parking pass from across the street or not. Was told I could not have a 1 hour additional late check out because of hotel availability. Two floor lamps sitting in corner of sleeping area with no place to plug them in. Bathrooms extremely small.,Positive,,,,,
"The staff was amazing. Our water person (sorry, I cannot remember her name) remembered us from breakfast the previous day (we had the buffet) and asked my boys if they wanted apple juice like yesterday. She was so nice and checked in on us often. In fact, the chef making omelettes came around to ask everyone how they were doing. Had the most amazing omelette both days. Loved the games (connect 4, bean bag toss, checkers and golf) in the lobby. Had a great time there with the family. Amazing pool, hot tub and sauna. Wonderful temperatures. We'll definitely come back again!",Positive,,,,,
"There is no way to keep a continuous fan running in the room, so the outside noise was distracting.",Negative,,,,,
"Room was great, except bathroom was not as clean as it could have been.  Window faced a busy street which was kind of noisy.  Everything else was perfect.",Positive,,,,,
Pillows were all too soft for my liking.  I like Tempur Pedic type pillows.  Room air conditioning did not cool sufficiently.  Staff was courteous enough to provide a fan.  We were in room 521.,Positive,,,,,
"Great front desk staff, friendly & professional - remembered my prefs",Positive,,,,,
Really enjoyed my stay.,Positive,,,,,
"Had someone asked us about our stay when we checked out, we wouldn't need to write these details in the survey. When maintenance came to the room to show us how to get the TV to a channel (besides snow), we were told to follow the directions on the sheet (channel listed was pointed to). TV in bedroom needed some other set up that included more than what was on the channel list sheet. When we tried to get to HBO, we entered the channel on the list and the list was incorrect, so we couldn't find HBO.
When we were watching the Badger game and ordering dinner at Pub 333, the bartender dealt with a customer in an unfriendly way, the situation escalated and security was called. When the swearing and yelling started, my daughter left and went into the bathroom until the customer paid and left. This all happened before any security arrived.  My daughters chicken pot pie was not fully cooked and was left mostly uneaten (we received 5.00 off the bill).
At 2:15am, the lobby area became so loud that it woke us on the 6th floor.
My husband was told he couldn't enter the breakfast area with only socks (even if it was just to sit and not eat), so he went up to the room. The next group of customers to the breakfast area included someone who was barefoot and they were allowed to enter.  When I inquired about the different treatment, I was told they brought slippers out for the other customer. 
I was surprised at how many issues we had to deal with in such a short period of time. We are very disappointed in our stay. The rude maintenance person, the escalated scene at Pub 333, noise at bar time and the inconsistency with shoes at breakfast were extremely disappointing.",Negative,,,,,
"Very nice room and stay. Only two complaints I would have:
1. The original price stated when I booked the reservation said the room would be $132 with taxes and everything included. It ended up automatically charging my card $157. If there was a fee change that should have been disclosed prior.
2. The hotel bar is supposed to be open until 2:00am (and the hours are posted that way). We walked down there at 1:00am and were told that it was closed and we could not order even though we still had a whole hour before it was supposed to be closed. No explanation was included either. This is very unprofessional.",Negative,,,,,
"Overall the staff was very friendly and the service was quick and prompt. However, it only takes one employee to under deliver a pleasant experience. When all of the staff is very nice, and then you encounter an employee that doesn't have the same tenor as the other staff, it makes the encounter fell twice as ""bad."" After a long day of work, I went up to my room only to discover my room key was not working. Naturally, that makes me feel flustered. I went downstairs to the front desk to tell them and the young girl does not apologize for the inconvenience, but instead tells me I shouldn't put the key card near my phone. While that's fine, she could have been more apologetic. In the hospitality industry, you don't point the finger at a tired customer. I also witnessed her being rude to a different upset customer. I was standing behind an a man who was making a complaint, and she goes, ""sir step over there."" She then tells the other employee, ""take him over there."" Her tone was just rude and off putting. I guarantee any other staff member would have handled it differently. She could have at least said, ""sir, I apologize for your inconvenience, but can you step to the right so that we may further assist you?"" Okay, I'm done ranting. Everyone else was great! I had a minor malfunction with the fridge in my room, but the staff was very friendly and helpful.",Positive,,,,,
"Im satisfied with my stay. I do want to mentionef that upon entering my room air freshner had been sprayed in my room.  Im highly affected any kind of chemical acents and perfumes.   I got an instant migraine  that lasted most of my stay.  I spoke to a staff member from housekeeping and she was great and help me get into a clean room that had not been sprayed yet.  I'm surprised that your hotel uses air freshner in each room after cleaning..  It's really not good for people with allergies and asthma.   (Especially in an encolsed space) Overall, I was quickly accommodated and all went well.  Housekeeping was great.",Positive,,,,,
Room was chilly - someone brought up a heater.,Negative,,,,,
Elevators are too slow.  TV in my room (423) was much smaller than others I have had on the same property.,Negative,,,,,
My family and I had a great stay. Everything was so wonderful.,Positive,,,,,
The room itself was absolutely disgusting.  We arrived late after a long drive and was exhausted.  Not sure the last time this room was used or cleaned before our stay.  There were dirty wash clothes in the bathroom again not sure how old these were.  Old items in the refrigerator and just filthy throughout.  We rushed out of their in the morning and didnt even attempt to stay for breakfast.  Will not be staying at this property again.,Negative,,,,,
Excellent stay; I would not hesitate to stay here again!,Positive,,,,,
We were there to celebrate my birthday. The furnace did not work during our stay and my family got sick. We had two little ones so it made our trip harder. Not satisfied with the stay.,Positive,,,,,
"Thanks to the staff for their rapid responses to our expressed needs for a hair dryer, a coffee/tea maker to replace a broken one, and a portable heater to improve heat in the room because of the overall reduced heat level in the hotel.",Positive,,,,,
"Overall, it was a very comfortable experience.  However - being a vegetarian, I found the food did not meet my needs very well and did not take advantage of it.  Also, not being a coffee drinker, the in-room service had limited tea availability which quickly went to none.  There were 2 black tea bags and 2 green upon my arrival.  I used the 2 green teas on the first of my three days and they were not replaced during the entire stay.  As I only interacted with two staff members in person (check-in  and out) and the hotel maid service (not personally seen) during my stay, I have to score a 50/50 on how much staff cared about me. Besides the lack of tea, the spare blanket in the room was soiled /stained at one end and although I placed it out and visible each day, it was never changed out for a clean one.",Positive,,,,,
"This is a beautiful hotel property. Exceptional room, very friendly and helpful staff. A wide variety if food options, close to everything!",Positive,,,,,
"1) Your in-house store could have more medicinal items- needed tums-didn't sell any antacids
2) Ate in your pub for lunch, wanted bacon added to an item and was told ""we can't add anything that is not on the original item""  Bacon was on 3 other items on the menu- would have made me happy to have bacon added to my item ( I certainly would have paid more for it)
3) Bathroom door was chewed up on the inside- didn't look the nicest when coming out of the shower.
4) Vents in room needed dusting
5) Hot chocolate was not available anywhere in the building- heard 5 people ask for it at breakfast- I know you have always had this in packets in the past- I would think this could be very easy to get and would have made people who don't drink coffee happy.
6) The large TVs in the room were a pleasant surprise- I enjoyed them!- Thank you",Positive,,,,,
Lunch service in the bar on Wed was really slow.  We were one of the first tables in there and last to receive food.  My room was falling apart.  The thermostat literally fell into about 8 pieces when I touched it.  My phone didn't work when I called the desk to tell them.  The temperature everywhere was a problem.  My room was very warm and I was told there was no way to rectify that. (Staff did bring up a fan which I appreciated.)  The meeting rooms were freezing.  I was uncomfortable the entire time I was there.,Negative,,,,,
"The Wisconsin Badger Football was not showing in our room but only in the bar, that was unacceptable",Negative,,,,,
"Sadly, my first two nights were not very pleasant mainly because of your air conditioning system.
The first night, I called to the front desk to ask for instructions on how to use the thermostat and they explained to me that I can turn it down to a comfortable temp and it would suffice. Through out the entire night I woke up often being uncomfortably warm. The instructions did not work and I was upset that I had to deal with this.  The following day, I requested to have maintenance come up and look at thermostat so I could adjust accordingly.  They came up to ""fix"" it but I spent that night very warm.  On the third day, I was that unfortunately, you really cannot adjust temps in room, it is either ""heat"" or ""a/c"". They then offered me a fan for the evening and suggested I open the patio door to cool down.  I was just extremely disappointed and am hoping I would be compensated for this. The two nights I really was miserable and would have liked to have had that information to begin with.  Would you be willing to comp one if not two nights or offer a stay in future? Thanks for your consideration.",Positive,,,,,
Hotel was very nice and clean and the staff were very friendly.,Positive,,,,,
Your hotel has charm and character. One thing that would be helpful would be better temperature controls in the rooms. I was challenged to get the thermostat to turn down to 70 degrees but it was a very warm for 70 degrees.,Positive,,,,,
Loved our room - great experience.  The person who checked us in and out was super friendly and even remembered my name when I went down to check out.  The only reason I say 9 for tranquility is because the view out of our window/sliding door was just a roof of another building and you cannot open the sliding door all the way.  Not at all a huge deal but just wanted to explain that. I also would have liked an actual fridge rather than just a cooler.  That would be better for food/drinks we wanted to keep cold,Positive,,,,,
I was very dissatisfied with the temperature control in the conference areas and in my room. It was freezing wherever I went!. Several times during the time I was there I went and stood in areas of sunlight to warm up. I put the heat up in my room as far as it would go and it never got above 70 degrees. That was the case when I stayed there last year. I generally annually attend a conference that is scheduled there every year in the Fall. I have stayed at the Hampton in the past. I may consider staying there in the future unless the heat issue is resolved.,Negative,,,,,
"We had no wash cloths the first night but were able to obtain some without difficulty.  Some of the people I was with had rooms with water damage and torn sheets.  the drain in the sink in the bathroom did not drain well but overall, it was a nice room",Negative,,,,,
"Room #813 I was put in first had a dripping ceiling with multiple bubbles on ceiling.  housekeeping should have told someone and that room be taken out of the rental block.  this was not a new issue as you could tell by the damage of the ceiling.  then moved to another room.  drapes literally shredded, sheets were shredded and holey from multiple bleach washings.  closet door was open to a dusty, damp closet where Christmas ornaments were stored.  not the level I'm expecting of a Hyatt",Negative,,,,,
"Very nice room, but was cold at night and I was not able to adjust the thermostat. There was an extra pillow but no extra blanket. Room was clean, spacious, bed comfy. Room price was great and it was nice to have the option to add on an early arrival or late departure. I was part of the Bellin Women's Half Marathon and it was wonderful to have a late departure. I was cold and sweaty after the 1/2Marathon and a long hot shower in my room was terrific! Thanks!",Positive,,,,,
"We were charged for parking for the  two rooms and we only had one car.  We told the staff member that at check in, yet we were still charged.",Neutral,,,,,
Suite was very clean. Staff very friendly.,Positive,,,,,
It was awful that we had to pay for parking when in the past this was never charged. Our room was extremely cold. We called hotel operator and they brought us a space heater. Really?,Negative,,,,,
"Loved everthing, wish your elevators moved faster.",Positive,,,,,
"Very difficult to control the temperature in the bedroom area, the unit was running all night and quite loudly, the temp read 74, we would adjust it down to 70, the temp would start to drop and go right back up.  The noise in the sitting area from the unit was very very loud thru the night.",Positive,,,,,
"The room was not in optimal condition with missing tiles in the bathroom. Filthy fan in the shower area and it was extremely dark in the entryway.  Unable to control heat/cooling in room.  Dark, gothic feel to entire hotel.",Negative,,,,,
"I have never seen a more dysfunctional heating/AC system in any hotel, let alone a Hyatt.",Negative,,,,,
Thanks. Great stay.,Positive,,,,,
"There is a great deal of appeal with the Hyatt, but I will list the things that were brought to the attention of the staff, but not resolved:

1.  The out door temperature was cooler than the seasonal norm and the heat did not operate in the room.  After two unsuccessful attempts Ray, the technician who is very nice, brought in a small room heater.

2.  The toilet ran continuously and the holding tank would be triggered to fill it to the set level approximately every 55 to 70 seconds.

3.  The door entry system needs maintenance or replacement.  It would take many attempts for the card reader to open the door and in the worst cases required perhaps 50 seconds to a minute to unlock the door.  The cards were replaced by the front desk which made no improvement.

4.  A minor point, but the back side of the bathroom door needs to be varnished from the steam which likely occurred over a long period of time.

5. The water pressure is weak to barley adequate.  For example we left the Hyatt after four nights and stayed the remaining night at the Hilton in Green Bay and the water pressure in the room was terrific, just as I like it.

6. Some of the bathroom supplies and coffee supplies were not replenished as they were used.  

7. The power button on the TV in the bedroom did not operate and the set had to be turned on and off with the manual buttons located on the side of the TV set.  The other controls on the remote worked adequately.   The smaller TV set in the other half of the room works satisfactorily.  Compared to the TV accommodations at the Hilton where we stayed for the remained to the visit, the Hyatt fell miserably short.  Every aspect of the function of the set and all the premium channels (HBO, SHOWTIME, ETC) were available at the Hilton, but not at the Hyatt.  The menu and function of the sets were vastly superior at the Hilton.",Positive,,,,,
Cleanliness was an issue. To be specific the vents were disgusting. And shower walls also.,Negative,,,,,
"Perhaps this isn't the place to bring this up, but I checked out early as I got called back to work in MN and couldn't enjoy the ""Packer"" weekend as I had planned.  I notified the person at the desk that I was checking out early.  I was hoping that the extra reward points could be credited back to me.  I understand if that's not possible, but I did check out Saturday morning.  I was hoping to get Saturday night and Sunday night credited back to me as I was unable to use them and enjoy the hotel.  I was also charged for parking both Saturday and Sunday.  I am happy to pay the first parking charge that I used for Friday's stay, but I don't agree with also being charged for Saturday and Sunday when I wasn't there.   
Always love this hotel, the staff, etc.  It's one of my favorite places to go.  Thank you",Positive,,,,,
Loved the staff.  The hotel was extremely clean.  It needs some refreshing.  I liked the family friendly experience.  Wished the bathroom was bigger.,Positive,,,,,
"This hotel is very tired. It reminds me of a cross between a hospital and a dormitory. Small, cramped bathroom. No towel bars. Heating does not go over 68 even if you increase temperature. The only bright spot was the front desk staff--very nice. F&B outlets pretty much a disaster. Asked for coffee or tea at bar and woman pointed to another area in hotel. Asked what kind of beer on tap, the woman ""pointed"" to the taps. Tried to get a coffee in the shop in the morning and they were out. I am a frequent hotel guest all over the US and this was very disappointing.  And the room rate is outrageous. I cancelled my first two nights of a wedding room block and stayed at the Kohler Lodge for less than half the price, and had a fabulous experience there. Obviously this hotel caters to football and/or wedding partiers who simply need a place to flop with a ""load on"". I would not stay at this hotel again. Sorry, Hyatt RGB, but you should lose that franchise. This does not fit with any Hyatt hotels I have stayed at. As a final note, my last night's stay I Wisconsin was at the Pfister in Milwaukee.  My suite there was approximately $30 more in cost and worth 100x more. You really need to kick this up and invest some money to redo this place. Sorry, no stars here for this stay and no, I will not stay there again.",Negative,,,,,
Suggest better trained bartenders and staffed bar area.  Prices were rather high for precisely measured drinks.,Positive,,,,,
"Extremely unhappy that the lack of heating/thermostat malfunction was not resolved and we spent 2 very cold nights. We were offered a space heater which I declined. I wish someone would have come to the room to look at the thermostat. 
In the food department one of our entrees,the hot mess, was so over cooked it was inedible. 
On a positive note the entire staff was extremely pleasant and helpful.",Negative,,,,,
"Room was not cleaned on last day of stay. Was told there would be an adjustment, but have not seen it.
Not cleaning room is inexcuseable",Positive,,,,,
"My only concern is wall outlet availability.   I have a CPAP and had to move a table to be able plug in my machine by the  bed.  Otherwise, everything was excellent.",Positive,,,,,
"I find it absolutely ridiculous that you charged $7 to park everyday when you already jacked up the price to over $300 per night.  With taxes and parking, my bill was $1200.  Jeeze!!!!  Not good when there is a brand new Hampton Inn right next door and their breakfast is FREE.",Positive,,,,,
Staff was exceptional and very nice.,Positive,,,,,
Beds were extremely uncomfortable. An unusual cold weekend. No heat was available and we had to ask to turn off the air conditioning.,Negative,,,,,
The hotel is beautiful and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.  My only complaint is that I fell and hurt my arm and hand by tripping over a significant separation in the sidewalk.  I reported the incident and security took pictures of my injuries and the sidewalk.  I experienced pain for 4 days following the incident and would appreciate a refund of 1 night stay as a small recompense.,Positive,,,,,
"Complaint: When you are waiting for an elevator on any floor, you have no idea as to which side the elevator door will open or when because they didn't install a floor notification above the elevator when they put the system in. Suggestion: Install a small Parabolic Mirror on each floor across the from the hallway where you are standing so you can see were the elevator is at. This would help identifying which side the elevator is on, especially if you have a lot of baggage.",Neutral,,,,,
"Room cleaning/servicing was sporadic. As a frequent traveler (weekly), Iâ€™ve stayed at many hotels. As a globalist, I have come to expect waters and coffee in the room daily. Unfortunately, Iâ€™ve had to leave a note to the staff to please put more body wash, shampoo, water, and coffee (when it was gone) into the room. The way I look at it, I shouldnâ€™t have to ask a person to do their job. Other hotel chains (yes, Iâ€™m Diamond with Hilton properties too) that Iâ€™ve stayed at have rarely needed a written request.",Positive,,,,,
"Hotel was great for the most part.  The only problem involved check-in.  We were part of a wedding group and our card was charged a much higher rate - over $100 higher.  Luckily I caught that and showed my confirmation and they stated that there was a late change to the contract but they would process it at the correct rate.  But since my card already had the hold on it, we will have to wait a few business days for the correct amount to go through.  My concern is why would this happen?  And what if I hadn't caught the mistake?  The Hyatt would have made an extra $100 off me.  Other than that, everything else was great.",Negative,,,,,
Tubs should have grab bars for older visitors. There was nothing to grab getting in and out of shower. No fans in bathroom is not good.,Positive,,,,,
The room was great. I would recommend the Hyatt Regency to all of my friends.,Positive,,,,,

"Staff was excellent with overall customer service.  Front desk was excellent. 
You might want to know -my room - #725 was pretty dusty. Dust on the bedside table and on all the base of the lamps, which surprised me. 
In the evening  I went to the front desk on my way up to my room to ask for more coffee and cream packs.  The person at the desk said he would send someone up shortly, delivery came so quick I didn't have time to get a tip ready.  The person who delivered it held it out as though maybe waiting for a tip.  It was actually uncomfortable.  
I would not even complain about any of this but since the survey showed up in my inbox I am taking the time to complete it.",Positive,,,,,
"I stayed in room 301, I plan on calling and having them check for bed bugs. I'm about 95% sure the hundred small red marks that ended up on my legs are from that room and bed. I will have my doctor confirm on Monday (it Saturday now). I'm not sure if it's a known problem, or occasional and just started.",Negative,,,,,
The air handler in the guest room was extremely noisy and wasnâ€™t able to shut it off,Negative,,,,,
The room was a little rough.  Cracking and peeling paint in the bathroom.  Wooden furniture and cabinets had chunks missing and large scratches.  Made an otherwise beautiful room look cheap and unkempt.,Negative,,,,,

The keycard didn't open the door the first time.   I had to return to the desk to reprogram the key.,Neutral,,,,,

"We are very pleased that we chose Hyatt. The bathrooms could use railings in the tub for safety. And it would be nice if a Green Bay area book were provided in each room, although we got one from the conference center, after a referral from the front desk. Exceptional shuttle service with very friendly staff",Positive,,,,,
slow elevator,Negative,,,,,
"The space in the king suite was great, as well as customer service however we were not able to control the temperature in the room. We thought A/C was on and programmable by thermostat in room. We awoke around 2:30 a.m. because it was too warm. Front desk said A/C was not on and they'd have security turn it back on. That seemed very strange too us. We have never rented a hotel room that we could not control the temperature inside. Also, no exhaust fan in bathroom which is never good. Did not like paid parking, even though it's advertised. It should only be for persons using event/conference  center not paying guests.",Positive,,,,,
"I complained two days in a row that our coffee pot leaked and the maid said it was fixed. No it wasnâ€™t it still leaked all over. Our bathroom was disgusting. Mold, scratched door. Four people got four towels? I went and got four more plus hygiene for four. We were charged on our hill 14.00 for parking as well as at th gate times two. Why charged three times 14x3?",Negative,,,,,
"Only 1 person at front desk at check in & check out. Had to wait in line, which was annoying. Employee uniform of a Hyatt t-shirt w/ a sport coat looks tacky.",Negative,,,,,
The food was not worth the price. Servers were friendly but nothing was quick. The rooms seem dated and not completely clean. I feel some updating and cleaning is needed.,Positive,,,,,
"Overall the room was clean, however, there was a towel in the bathroom left from the last guest which was really gross.",Negative,,,,,
Parking should be included in the hotel stay. Breakfast shouldnâ€™t be so expensive either.,Positive,,,,,
"The staff were great.  Always attentive and pleasant.
There was a wait to get our food once we ordered, but that may have been because of the number of people in the bar/restaurant that night.
I was disappointed there wasn't a breakfast option included in the room cost, but I attended a conference at the KI center which provided breakfast so that wasn't an issue.
If breakfast is eventually included in the room cost, please have it focus on healthy options.",Positive,,,,,
The amount of you receive for the price is outrageous and cost of drinks is crazy. Will definitely avoid the hotel bar and restaurant in future visits.,Negative,,,,,
"My AC unit wasnâ€™t working in my room. I had to call 3 times to get it fixed, and I was still very uncomfortable all night. It seemed to kick on the next morning as I was about to leave. Also, each time I called about the problem, the person that answered did not apologize. Not once did I hear â€œIâ€™m sorry.â€ That is a customeyou service basic.",Negative,,,,,
"The bed in 333 needs to be replaced.  Beautiful room and hotel,  bed was old and like sleeping in a fish bowl. My recommendation is to upgrade the beds",Positive,,,,,
Room Door closing all night was very loud. Consider bigger TVs for rooms,Negative,,,,,
"We really enjoyed our stay at the hotel.  The breakfast buffet was a disappointment.  For the price of $12.95 I expected more selections.  The options were reminiscent of continental breakfast offerings at hotels that provide ""free"" breakfast.  The room and the staff were amazing.",Positive,,,,,
The lady at the front desk at check in was extremely cordial and we really appreciated her kindness.,Positive,,,,,
We had come into the bar at 12am.No one came to our table then she tells us we missed last call??When was the first last call?She wanted to leave work I get it but it was not last call.Very poor on her part the bar lost a lot of money that night.,Negative,,,,,
"My room felt a big muggy- I asked for a air purifier and I was given one quickly which helped a lot. The vent in the bathroom had visible dust or lint or something that was flying off of it which didn't help the feeling of not getting ""good air"" in the room. Otherwise the bed and the accommodations were very comfortable. The bathroom in the one bedroom suite was quite small- very tight coverage between the door- toilet- shower. I would've preferred a smaller room for a bigger bathroom.",Positive,,,,,
Staff were friendly and helpful. The room was nice. Bathroom could have been cleaner.,Positive,,,,,
"The sign for your building is hidden and was difficult to find - also my GPS map on Waze brought me to the wrong check in location. I also have specific dietary needs and they were not met (celiac disease - no gluten including cross contamination). That being said, hosts were welcoming, fresh fruit was nice and the pool was awesome.",Negative,,,,,
My only complaint was the coffee in my room was all decaf and I didn't realize it until it was too late.  But that was minor! The hotel overall was wonderful! Thank you!,Positive,,,,,
Great customer service. I will stay here again.,Positive,,,,,
"Stacy and Noely, don't know if I spelled her name right,  at the bar went above and beyond to treat us awesome,  and help us with items to get our flag to help fly in the stair climb the next day. Got us a broom handle,  zip ties, and tape.  The front desk just looked at us like we were stupid, and then the called maintenance or whoever they called and first said the would call or room,  which they didn't and then said they have nothing to use.  Now for flying a flag for the 911 memorial stair climb you think they could of find us a broom handle.  But nope, Stacy and Noely did though. Than for breakfast every year we always get fruit to go,  the ladies who were there Saturday morning the day of the climb were so confused.  It's not hard,  put some fruit in a container and be done with it.  They got a lady from the kitchen and she showed me a menu,  NO MENU JUST FRUIT! She said they don't do to go things, and she has been here for 10 years.  She was so confused what I kept asking,  I said just take some fruit and throw it in a bag. It took about 10-15 mins and came back with almost it. Almost $10 was the total,  thought it was high priced but whatever.  Not saying to bend over backwards for your guests, but us firefighters spend ALOT of money both there and in Green Bay this last weekend.  Simple courtesy  things go along way. Oh ya and Stacy from the bar made it a point to find us after the stair climb and ask us about it and look at pictures from it,  and the American Flag she helped to make fly.",Positive,,,,,
I had to request for shampoo to be replenished in the room. This was the first time I ever had to do this in a hotel. This was unexpected and very surprising for a Hyatt Regency.,Negative,,,,,
"We love this hotel, but the room was very warm and nobody helped- even after numerous calls to the service desk",Positive,,,,,
The room was surprisingly dusty. Super dusty.,Positive,,,,,
"Upon our arrival, I was greeted by the front desk by 2 attentive reps who went out of their way to fullfill my needs. The accommodations were excellent and I was very impressed with The design and layout of the whole hotel. I also want to add that the shuttle service, Glen was something that I did not expect. We went out during a rain storm! Thank you so much to the excellent staff at the Hyatt for my stay in Green bay! Highly recommended.",Positive,,,,,
I was put in an accessbile room which is not a problem but it is stuck in the corner by the stairwell and made me wonder how truly accessible it was as there was not a lot of room to maneuver within that nook of the hallway. The bathtub did not drain well and could use a deeper cleaning/caulk replacement.,Positive,,,,,
Awesome customer service!! Great space and clean.  Wish I had a place like this in all the places that I visit,Positive,,,,,
"ROOM WAS VERY WARM, AS THE A/C DID NOT WORK VERY WELL AT COOLING ROOM DOWN TO TEMPERATURE DESIRED...",Positive,,,,,
Very tired hotel,Negative,,,,,
The hotel did not live up to what I expect when I stay at a Hyatt.  The ceiling leaked when it rained and there were a dozen buckets out to catch the drops.  The breakfast was expensive and exceedingly average.  The bar was a good size with many TVs but the staff was not very engaging.  When you walk through the doors no one welcomes you.  I was very disappointed.,Positive,,,,,
Thanks to your group - we enjoyed our stay :).,Positive,,,,,
"Our rooms were a block of rooms that were reserved by Air Treatment Corporation. Rooms for Paul Bartunek, Thomas Shircel and Ron Fleischman were to be charged to the individualâ€™s AMEX credit card and not Air Treatment. We had asked multiple times if this was the cases and was assured it was. Front desk staff needs training in this area.  This was embarrassing that these 3 rooms were charged to our customer, Air Treatment Corporation after we were assured they were not. Sincerely, Ron Fleischman.",Positive,,,,,
Have towel racks in the bathroom! The food at the breakfast buffet could have been hotter.,Positive,,,,,

Excellent management and staff at the Hyatt in Green Bay. Very friendly and attentive to every need.,Positive,,,,,
"Great place and location, rooms are a little outdated",Negative,,,,,
"The housekeeping service wasnâ€™t very thorough - missed us the first day, didnâ€™t leave toilet paper or clean glasses second day. Overall staff incredibly helpful tho!",Positive,,,,,
"The staff at the morning buffet couldn't possibly have been nicer!! I can flag at least five different people who came to me at different times to make sure I had everything I needed. Incredible! They were all so nice and kind for my breakfast on Saturday morning, September 15.",Positive,,,,,
"My party had to wait 90 minutes in the hotel lobby for the hotel shuttle that was absent from the lot, even though we had a reservation. Elevators are old, very slow and outdated. My room was dirty and not cleaned well. All of these were addressed with front desk staff who said they would fix it other than the elevators.",Negative,,,,,
The chain came off the flapper in the toilet tank in the middle of the night and had to reach in to be able to flush the toilet.,Negative,,,,,
I rated customer service as a 5 and staff as 5 only because I am trying to get a copy of my reciept (not bill) and no one has relied to my emails yet.,Positive,,,,,
"The ceiling coating was falling down onto the floor, table had only 1 chair - an office chair!  It was filthy.  The shower did not drain into the the floor drain, it flowed onto the floor in front of the sink - had to mop up with towels so we didn't have to stand in water to dry our hair.  complete lack of shelves, had to keep cosmetics in our travel bags on the floor of the bath room.  I have to say in 55 years of travel it was the 2nd tackiest room we've ever stayed in.  we could have complained but were here to enjoy time with our family.  When we checked in, I questioned being put in the handicapped room.  Because of a wedding and the Packer game all rooms were taken.  At check out, I listed our complaints and they deducted the 7 days of parking fees.  $35.00.  We will not be staying at the Hyatt during our next visit to Green Bay.",Negative,,,,,
"rooms need renovation
overall hotel is showing its age",Positive,,,,,
"I would like to make one request or suggestion.  All the rooms have a very nice full size mirror, but they are propped up on top of a counter so you can't use it as a full length mirror, to just see your entire self to determine if you outfit is all put together.  It seems like a waste and I would love to see the mirrors hung in a manner that they are functional as a full length mirror.  Thanks!",Positive,,,,,
desk chair in my room was broken. Breakfast buffet (that was paid for) selection and quality was very mediocre and eggs were actually empty of one day. Staff in breakfast area very friendly.,Negative,,,,,
Thank you for the wine and hors d'oeuvres when we checked in on Friday. That was a very nice touch! We also appreciated the staff providing us with information about the free city bus service to and from the Packer game on Sunday! Your staff did an excellent job!,Positive,,,,,
Great staff in the restaurant,Positive,,,,,
Room service menu times are inaccurate or the staff does not know the correct times and meals posted on the menu.,Negative,,,,,

Only have 6 pieces of facial tissue when I arrive. I had to get a new box next morning from the cleaning lady.

Need a sign at the front of the building..... my coworkers and I circled around few times in order to know itâ€™s this hotel!!!!",Positive,,,,,
The person in the room above me was smoking and my room was filled with cigarette smoke.  It ruined my stay.  Hotel staff brought me a fan which helped but I couldn't open the window because there wasn't a screen on it.,Negative,,,,,
"People in the room next to ours were very noisy until midnight. Called front desk at 9:30. Was told that security would be contacted but it didnâ€™t help. The room never had all of shampoo,conditioner, body wash, and lotion. When the reservation was made there was no mention of a $100 pet cleaning fee.",Negative,,,,,
"Dingy and frankly, depressing.  Arrived at hotel around 8:00pm. Initially drove past hotel - evidently no one at hotel recognizes the sign outside of hotel is burned out. Interior of hotel is poorly illuminated as well.  Atrium hotels were all the rage in the 1980â€™s - evidently Hyatt seems to think no improvements are necessary since then.",Negative,,,,,
"I1 the sign is not visible at night to say the least in the rain. the very small sign that is lit is almost invisible from the street. I passed the Hampton inn several times trying to find the Hyatt and almost stayed at Hampton Inn bc it was so ridiculous trying to find hyatt.  I finally got there beleaguered and was offered nothing 2) room was updated but obviously old. tile was broken in shower. carpet needs stretched. Street noise was highly audible. could hear someone slamming against my wall, doors etc. I asked about member program that I had because I still get email. they were like we can't find you. no one explained the parking lot debacle. with the gates and what do I do with the tickets.  Food my rate included breakfast, service was poor. I got my own coffee. They mentioned made to order omelets but there was no one making them visibly. I asked for one and it was so laden with salt it was hardly edible. there were basins collecting leaking water all around the food area you had to dodge to get back and forth.  The pot for the oatmeal. . . maybe replace? i wouldn't have that in my own kitchen it is peeling and rusting. . .yuck. The coffee was terrible too like it came from a premade source platicy. I wanted to watch television briefly and had trouble with the TV. I turned it on and the LG logo just floated all over. I called the front desk and they were like well did you turn it on? have you checked the inputs? I mean I wouldn't have bothered to call if I hadn't already tried that.  I will say that your pillows and beds are very comfortable. 

Generally the Hyatt is a good stay. If this was a former embassy suites they usually have happy hour and o deurves. I asked about that and was like they have food and drinks in there pointing to the bar. if I were yo come back I would not stay there. no way",Positive,,,,,
"Everything was great, except the elevators were very slow.",Positive,,,,,
Hard to find hair dryer. in closet.someone set alarm for 6am,Negative,,,,,
"There was no complimentary coffee in lobby, which is standard in most hotels. Breakfast was priced high but was only average quality. The selection of healthy options was nice but the overall quality of the breakfast experience was subpar given the price, and the fact that you had to serve yourself.",Positive,,,,,
Your rooms set aside for wedding guests cost more than guests who got a room not set aside for wedding guests. Not happy with that.,Positive,,,,,
Room wasn't ready for check in at 3:15,Positive,,,,,
"We always enjoy our stay at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay! The rooms are spacious and quiet. The breakfast is great, also.",Positive,,,,,
It would have been nice to been told at check-in that you had a complementary breakfast. Thereâ€™s nothing in the room that indicates this either. We didnâ€™t know until we were checking out it was too late to eat. Otherwise it was a good stay. Thank you!,Positive,,,,,
"Carrie was very helpful over the phone when I booked. In the evening, the front desk person helped us get pizza delivery phone numbers and was very nice and polite. (Saturday September 1)",Positive,,,,,
"Because of the quality of the hotel, we were very surprised that continental breakfast wasn't included.",Positive,,,,,
Breakfast could be better since you pay 12.50 a person. The eggs weren't done or something wrong with them.,Positive,,,,,
"Nice hotel, friendly front desk staff",Positive,,,,,
"Lousy mattress, poor & inconsistent housekeeping; woodwork & doors beaten up, toilet clogged, bathroom floor tile disgusting, breakfast service poor but good omelette, despite request originally placed across from elevators; ended up across from brick wall, a/c vents filthy which is why a/c was inadequate, 1 business desk computer was known to not connect to server, front desk staff very pleasant. NOT the Hyatt experience I've had elsewhere. Never again. Back to the Hilton.",Negative,,,,,
"The parking gates were not working.  We were charged the parking fee but when we came back at night the lot was full. We were directed to an overflow lot which was free to the public.  I spoke with someone at the front desk at check out and the fee was refunded.  But since the gates were left open and there is no method to keep track of the vehicles, the parking fee should not have been added from the start.  Just a suggestion to avoid complaints in the future.",Negative,,,,,
Very noisy lobby.  Little control over loud people at 2AM!,Negative,,,,,
"I didnt like that I have to pay for parking. Breakfast was not included. And when I was looking for the hotel at night I noticed it had poor lighting, I couldnâ€™t find the hotel.",Positive,,,,,
Our exterior room had a lot of outside noise.,Neutral,,,,,
"Zhanna at the front desk was not too friendly at check in, but was super nice at check out and when we went to ask for dinner recommendations. The hotel was mostly nice but could use some updates. The wood features in the room were worn and could potentially leave splinters if not careful. The hot water in the wet bar area didn't work though I let the water run for a while to make sure.",Positive,,,,,
Stayed for our 30th wedding anniversary and Mike and staff we awesome even wished us a happy anniversary.,Positive,,,,,
"Think that having to pay a parking fee while a paying guest is a bit ridiculous, especially since there are not other options for parking. The gates and tickets were very tedious and clumsy.  The breakfast/parking promotion is silly.",Negative,,,,,
"Checked into our room, there was no toilet paper. No problem, we asked the worker who delivered our food to get us some. 20 minutes passed, no toilet paper. Called the front desk to get some and they asked how many we wanted. I understand you are trying to be polite but just bring us some. We only were staying for a night. When we checked in, we were given a breakfast menu. We walked into our room and there was another menu for breakfast but it differed completely from the first. There was no date on either of the menus so we didn't know exactly which one to order from. That was confusing. The roof was leaking in the lobby all over the place. The bed we had was VERY squeaky. If you even rolled over, the bed would make noise. The fan/AC system in the room was VERY annoying. It was very loud and went off every 5 - 10 minutes no matter the temperature in the room. It was right next to the bed as well so it was very loud. The layout of the room could have been better. The tv was extremely far from the Overall, I was looking for a hotel that really blew me away with design, looks, staff, and a welcoming feeling but I didn't feel any of that. It was just a normal 2-3 star hotel. Not the 4 star it claims to be.",Positive,,,,,
"I am typically very conservative with my ratings, to earn a 10 requires things to be better than expected by a non-trivial margin. I have stayed at the Green Bay Hyatt many times in the past 18 months and the staff truly goes above and beyond on a weekly basis, which is why I gave all tens. Please keep up the great work. There are too many great employees to name them all, but Iâ€™d like to specially thank Heather, Noely, Matthew, Jenna, and Scott.",Positive,,,,,

A very pleasant stay.  Staff was excellent in all regards.   Breakfast was great.  Complimentary coffee in the lobby area would be a  nice touch.,Positive,,,,,
The only thing odd was there was something going on with the guests. A lot of them staying here weâ€™re leaving there doors open and visiting and drinking with each other.  It got a little loud.  That had never happened in previous stays.,Neutral,,,,,
What a great hotel ! Outstanding staff and beautiful facility,Positive,,,,,
"Check-in woman asked if we wanted the check-in ""special"" for $25 to include brunch for 2, free 1 one parking and $5 credit in the Market.  It wasn't done and the check-out person said she couldn't accommodate it.  Hum?  Interesting.  Also, one of the 2 front desk people also sid she would apply the night stay to my World of Hyatt account which wasn't done.  I added it after the fact.",Positive,,,,,

I think its terrible that you charge guests to park. It should be free if you stay there,Negative,,,,,
very clean Room staff was very nice,Positive,,,,,
"I love your hotel and stay there whenever I'm in Green Bay. A couple of suggestions is the bathroom doors really need to be updated. They're  really beat up on the inside in all the rooms that I've stayed in so far. Also I was in room 734 and the fan in the bathroom is not working and the bathroom drain is really slow. I was going to tell the staff there when I checked out and I forgot. I want you to know especially about the fan so it doesn't wreck the paint in the bathroom. Overall it's a great place to stay, thank you!",Positive,,,,,
My room was directly in front of the elevator which made it noisy even after closing the door in between the bedroom and the living space.  My profile indicates I like to be away from the elevator; my sheets smelled like cologne (ie they clearly had not been changed since the last guest was in the room) but I didn't discover that until midnight when I was going to bed and it was too late for me to ask for someone to fix the issue. I did let the reception desk know in the morning.,Neutral,,,,,
"I have stayed at this hotel at least several times a year, for the past 4 years and have to admit I was quite disappointed in the service on this visit. First, my room was not ready when I arrived around 4:45pm. I was informed by the desk clerk that a lot of the rooms were not clean. The clerk could not give me a time frame on when my room would be ready, which was quite an i conviene because i was going to the football game that evening. I made sure to have the clerk verify my reservation for a â€œcorner king roomâ€, which she did, however although she looked up and verified my reservation she kept asking me questions about my checking out time the following day. My reservation was for 4 nights!! 
When I finally returned to the hotel after the game at 11pm, I received my key to my room and again asked the clerk (now a young man) if my room was indeed the corner king, to which he responded yes. Now, I always make a point to reserve this room type because the open floor plan is ideal for my impaired vision. Unfortunately the room was incorrect. I was given a one bedroom room and could not even find the light switch as I entered which can prove dangerous because of my impaired vision. I went back to the front desk to  remedy the mistake and was told there was nothing that could be done because they were all filled. Although this was disconcerting, it was the attitude of the female st the counter that was upsetting. There was no concern or regard for the fact they made a mistake and when I asked if I could change my room to the proper room the next day, she showed no compassion or willingness to remedy the situation. Her remark was simply that I could try. 
I did get the room changed the next afternoon, but the new desk clerk (although helpful) did not appear to understand why I wanted to change or how to do it. This was not the only time I felt the staff was not proficient in their job knowledge and performance. From the front desk to the restaurant to the Marketplace, it was as if the hotel was in the midst of training new employees or had interns working. In all my past visits I have never experienced such a lack of knowledge and customer service.
Also, the bathroom in my second room had a distinct musty smell that I had never experienced before.
I thoroughly have enjoyed my stats at this hotel in the past, but if this is the way things are being done now, I may reconsider staying here for my future visits.",Positive,,,,,
"The parking situation is atrocious at this hotel!  For that reason alone I cannot recommend it.  The need to take a ticket and have it validated is a nuisance at best.  However the most aggravating issue was when we arrived back at the hotel at 1:00 a.m., the lot was full with no signs directing us on where to go.  We had to call the front desk form our cell phone and were told to park a block away at a public lot and walk back to the hotel.  What a pain!  Definitely not the Hyatt experience we are used to.  Very disappointing and surprised that this place gets to brand itself as a Hyatt regency.",Negative,,,,,
Hotel staff was great. Wedding staff help was eager to leave as soon as they could.,Positive,,,,,

We loved our stay at the Hyatt Regency as well as our Green Bay experience!  Would definitely come back again!,Positive,,,,,

"Our room could have been cleaned better before our stay. Bedding didnâ€™t appear clean, furniture needed better dusting, there was old food and toys under the sofa bed, there was leftover garbage around the room as well. Other than that we really enjoyed the hotel but housekeeping should have gone over the room again before letting someone check in.",Positive,,,,,

"Comments related to my above ratings: 
Check-in: My room was not ready for quite some time because some kind of large group was taking a long time to check out, so I had to change my clothes and do my makeup in the public restroom in order to get ready for my conference that afternoon. This was not an ideal situation. Also, when I checked in, the girl at the desk did NOT tell me that I had to reserve the shuttle days in advance in order to get to the airport when my stay was over. This is an unacceptable oversight.
Tranquility: The doors/windows in the front of the room were so not sound-proof that early every morning, I could hear the clinking of dishes in the restaurant several floors below. 
Check-out: I had a terrible check-out experience. No one had told me that I needed to reserve the shuttle days in advance in order to get a ride to the airport upon check-out. This is a terrible oversight, and I'm very upset about it. Someone should have told me this when I checked in. If they had, I would have called the front desk and made an appointment to make sure I had a ride to the airport. Instead, I had to sit in the lobby for almost two hours to wait for a the shuttle, which was incredibly inconvenient, because the shuttle driver was taking a lengthy break and couldn't be disturbed. Because I was at the mercy of the shuttle driver's break schedule, I ended up having to leave the hotel much later than I'd wanted, which was very stressful and made me nervous I would not arrive at the airport with enough time. I also was upset at how the front desk staff handled the situation. Never once did I feel like they actually cared, and I never got what I considered any kind of sincere apology -- they simply kept repeating the same rehearsed lines over and over again about the shuttle driver taking a break, as if I hadn't heard them the first time. I'd had a fairly pleasant experience with your hotel until this very last day, and now -- because of the way the front desk handled my shuttle situation -- my opinion is very tarnished. This is very disappointing.",Positive,,,,,
"PROS
Manager was very friendly and courteous.
Hotel was nice.
Man at front desk was nice.
Shuttle was convenient and drivers were friendly.

CONS
Late check-in. Also, we received no text message or call when our room was available, so we were out in the lobby for over 2 hours. We finally got our room around 6:45 - 7pm. We didn't have time to shower before our evening meetings.
Woman checking us in/checking us out told us the wrong time for the shuttle to the airport and told us that we could not request a different time. Later, when we discovered someone else had requested a different time she acted like she hadn't made the mistake. I wish that she'd just admitted she made the mistake and apologized instead of accusing two people of hearing her wrong and not explaining the rules.",Positive,,,,,
"Check-in was an issue as an entire conference preceding us was checking out late. We only got a couple days notice about this, kind of late to change flight plans. I got there at 10am, figured I might have to wait an hour or two. Didn't check in until 3pm.",Neutral,,,,,
As an explorist Member I was supposed to get 2 bottles of water each day.  Only got one day.  Housekeeping didnt replenish.,Positive,,,,,
"I stayed four nights at your hotel for a conference. It was obvious that the hotel was an older building, but everything was very well maintained and anything I asked for, I received very quickly, so thank you. 

However, that being said, I have a couple of issues. 
1) When you offer a conference room rate for a stated price, it is unfair to raise that rate for that block of rooms because of some event that is occurring elsewhere in town. I was offered a rate of $149, which was a great rate, but then on Thursday night I had to pay $229 because of the football game, which I was not interested in, nor could I have attended, even if I wanted to, because of the conference activities. I was very irritated at having to pay more for Thursday night when it was intuitively obvious that I was NOT there for that game or any other event, except for my conference. So next time I come for a conference, maybe I will stay next door at the Hampton Inn.

2) You REALLY need to upgrade your elevators. They run slower than molasses in January. I cannot express how frustrated I got several times waiting for an elevator. And you may think I could just use the stairs, but that is not so. I have arthritis in both knees and was on the 6th floor. This is a big issue for me and something that makes it less likely that I will stay at your hotel next time.",Positive,,,,,
"The air in our room (207) did not work well. We were too warm, even after adjusting the thermostat. And the room needed more electrical outlets.",Positive,,,,,
hotel needs to be renovated.,Neutral,,,,,
"this was an older facility, I get it. The bar/restaurant staff was inequity and the wait times for food off the chart. We waited 40 minutes before drinks on more than one occasion. Food even longer and half the tables came out a further 20 minutes later. There were no more than three
 other tables seated.",Positive,,,,,
It was great having a member (Discoverist) check in line. Awesome perk makes you feel very valued. Check in was just minutes! :),Positive,,,,,

"There was a long wait to check in, after the check-in time.",Negative,,,,,
"Overall the hotel is dated but has comfortable beds and is in good shape for its age. It needs a remodel. My problems are with staff, specifically, the Pub and Housekeeping. The pub served all the members of my party except me and kept me waiting for an hour with no food. I had to leave for a meeting and got no dinner than night. They never informed me that there was a problem with my meal or asked me if I wanted to order anything else. And there was no one to ask for help. They finally said they couldn't find any turkey for my turkey sandwich. This is really awful service. Housekeeping also did a bad job. I paid for late checkout. I wanted to catch a nap before my flight. But Housekeeping ignored my Privacy sign and knocked on my door and tried to open it - TWICE!! Needless to say, I got no sleep. I have never had housekeeping do that at any hotel I have ever stayed at. Fortunately the front desk provided good service and refunded me the fee for my late check out.",Positive,,,,,
"Staff friendly and professional. Tried to make us comfortable when check in was delayed. I do wish more of an effort had been made to have shuttles available when conference attendees were arriving or the manner and time we should have requested shuttle service had been more clearly and consistently communicated. Otherwise, great service and room.",Positive,,,,,
"I was welcomed by Colton who provided great customer service. The rooms are clean but dated and dark (popcorn ceilings, small light in center of room and a 80's feel. Could tell bathroom had received some updating. My bad had been lost and I had told the front desk. I'd also told the driver my room. Yet, I never received a call to my room or a text on my phone that my bag was in the lobby that evening. When  I went down to inquire about it they immediately knew my name so they could have let me know (basic customer service) or even brought it to my room (great customer service). My room had a connecting door and a family stayed the night. Unless the hotel was completely booked out, it would have been better to put people that didn't have to get up at 6 am next to those who do. The breakfast buffet could also use some help. There was fruit but no yogurt or granola/cereal. Even a make-your-own waffle center or other self-service items (like various breads and bagels and a toaster) would be appreciated. The pastries were heavy and not good at all (supermarket type).  Finally, there was a stain on the wall in my room. I'm hoping it was a different paint versus mold as I have arrived home and am not feeling well. Something to check. Also, shuttle service needs a bit of organization. I think some training and some updates will make this a much better and appealing place for attendees.",Positive,,,,,
"The hotel is sadly in dilapidated state, appears to not have been updated in at least a decade, including elevators that must be 30 years old. Had to wait hours to check in even though the hotel had notice of our writers' conference. The worst part of the entire stay was the food. It was horrible. The meals were subpar, tasteless, overpriced and simply awful. I had to ask that items be removed from my bill, like the hummus, because it was inedible. After checking out and returning home, I realized I had left some items in my room and called the hotel to see if they had been found. The woman at the front desk was rude and couldn't have cared less. She promised to call me back and never did. This is completely antithetical to the excellent treatment I have always had at Hyatt hotels. I will never go back to the Green Bay Hyatt.",Negative,,,,,
"Refrigerated cooler had a loud annoying buzzing whine that kicked on periodically, especially noticeable in late evening when sitting in the sitting room. At least I was able to close the sound off with the bedroom door so it didn't keep me awake. I mentioned it when I checked out.",Negative,,,,,
Very nice room. Staff handled delay in check in well.,Positive,,,,,
"The first day I was there I called maintenance about a clogged drain in my bathroom sink. It was never fixed. Also, the hotel advertises that they have a shuttle service to and from the airport. The shuttle service was very limited.",Negative,,,,,
Room was dusty. The staff members who were on duty tried but the hotel was clearly understaffed to deal with the volume of conference check ins. The room was very dusty.,Negative,,,,,
"Overall, the stay was excellent. However, the restaurant is awful. It is understaffed and, even when there are no customers, it takes an minimum of ONE HOUR to get a simple sandwich...no matter what day it is or time of day. It's always ONE HOUR or more. It took 30 mins for one member of our table of four to get a Diet Coke. I guess they had to mix it from scratch in beakers. The service staff never apologizes, either, for the outrageously long wait times for food. Shameful. That said, the food in the little store by the front desk is surprisingly good -- I loved the cookies! The elevators are extremely slow as well.",Negative,,,,,
"We had a banquet and no one cleared the dirty dishes away, ever. It was weird, gross, and crowded, especially since the dessert was on the table before we came in, including cheesecake. Who wants to eat cheesecake that's been sitting out, sweating for more than an hour? Yuck. Little hot blobs of whipped cream. Then that night, I got a salad in the market with a packet of blue cheese dressing and the dressing was rancid. I called to let someone know, but I can't help but wonder... did anyone throw out the rest of that dressing? I was offered a new salad (which I didn't take), but still I wonder. The room was nice and clean, everything else was good. Really underwhelmed on the food front. Also, I wasn't going to check out at all (I usually don't at hotels) when I heard someone I know arguing about being charged for breakfast when he shouldn't have been, so I decided to make sure I hadn't been, as well. I wasn't, but there was $111 charge on my bill for a dinner I didn't eat at the 333 Pub!!! The woman at the desk took it off, but her reaction made me think it happens regularly. SO not okay.",Positive,,,,,
"Overall - Excellent.  A slight delay at check-in secondary to the NFL Tennessee Titans staying late and rooms not quite ready. Overall, it did not affect my stay and the staff apologized profusely.",Positive,,,,,
Some snafus checking in. The food is good but service leaves something to be desired.,Positive,,,,,
"We arrived after 11:30 pm, and the desk clerk was very nice and helpful.  My daughter had forgotten to bring her toothbrush, and he had one sent up to our room within a few minutes!  Thank you!",Positive,,,,,
Check in was at 3pm and room wasn't ready until 430pm. The staff was great with dealing with the delay in rooms and gave us a free breakfast.  It was still disappointing that there was such a long wait for our room. I feel like they could have discounted there rooms and offered the breakfast without asking for anything. The rooms were already marked very high because of a game so if think they could have afforded to take some money off the rooms.,Positive,,,,,
"Inwas surprised how unprepared the hotel was for the packers game. Too many guests, including my family, were not able to check in until just before the game started! I expected this Hyatt to be prepared like others Iâ€™ve stayed with in the past for large events.",Positive,,,,,
The staff is very professional in all areas.,Positive,,,,,
The air conditioning in room 332 was very poor.  I called to have it looked at after a very humid hot night of sweating.  Next night were a bit less humid but it was still uncomfortable.  Upon checking I was in a studio and I wanted a suite.  I had to go back down to check in and fix it.,Negative,,,,,
The hotel and food service is very nice. The hotel appears to have been recently remodeled and is in a very good location. The staff is very nice and helpful as well.,Positive,,,,,
Staff very nice.  Dawn did a great job cleaning room (814).  Elevator(s) are extremely slow as always - one was out of service for a bit first day.  Drink prices in bar were to the point we left and went other venues that were cheaper (and I am from metro Milwaukee).  I do like the staff and hotel but I think a review of what I pointed out is needed as I heard the same observations from almost everyone I came in contact with,Positive,,,,,
"Overall the stay was pleasant and I enjoyed the stay.  I arrived and checked in about 10:30pm on a Sunday night. Thorough my three night stay, It was necessary for me to park off site and use the pay for parking city lot across the street. That was an expense I wasn't expecting, but it is what it is and I realize parking is limited.  Breakfast was great and handled nicely. As for a dinner, I was disappointed. While staying at the Hyatt  always order a late evening Salmon meal. and take it back to my room. During this stay, I ordered it only once. I found it was nothing like past years. The size was very portion and it was not a good experience.   I used the extra blanket and later noticed it was most likely pre-used. There was some red lipstick on it and appeared to have some blackish eye shadow on it. Similar to a former patron using it to wipe off there makeup or something to that affect. In general the room looked very clean, however, once taking a shower, I observed two long dark hairs stuck on the interior wall of the bath/shower wall",Positive,,,,,
"Room 207, corner of bathroom wall noticeably and unattractively stained. A little maintenance TLC could fix this.",Neutral,,,,,
When I checked in I shared that the parking lot was full. I was told that I could use the parking ramp across the street for a charge. My room was loud with the street noise and elevator noise and vibration (FYI---I stay in hotels a lot and NEVER have complained about noise in the past). I asked for a noon checkout and was told I could not extend by an hour. Overall a poor experience with a staff that was unaccommodating. The employees in the courtyard restaurant were nice.,Positive,,,,,
"Charged sales tax when I was exempt, but that is an easy fix.",Positive,,,,,
I had a salad from your snack shop and it was incredible (fresh and tasty).  Thank you for having that as a quick stop option within the hotel.,Positive,,,,,
The overall stay was great.  The only problem was that the fridge in our room did not stay closed.,Negative,,,,,
Check in and check out employees were not genuinely welcoming and sweet. The food employees were wonderful and took care of their space and guests very well.,Positive,,,,,
My wife and I separately requested to talk with the manager on duty several times and were told each time that they were not available.  I asked to be called on my phone as soon as the manager was available (which was to be in 1.5 hours but never received the call.  Found that staff was unable to make decisions by themselves.,Positive,,,,,
"All of your staff were very pleasant.  They always had a smile and greeted me and interacted with me.  The breakfast buffet was great and the service excellent.  Check in and out was very easy, as it always is.  The bartenders were very nice and service was excellent.  Overall, every stay at this locations has been excellent.",Positive,,,,,
I enjoyed my stay at the hotel.  The front desk staff and cleaning service were great.  I look forward to returning to the hotel in the near future.  Keep up the great work!,Positive,,,,,
"Staff, facilities, food and service are all excellent.  THE ELEVATORS ARE PAINFULLY SLOW.",Positive,,,,,
"Forgot to leave shampoo, conditioner, lotion and bath mat/towel",Positive,,,,,
Beautiful and comfortable hotel room. Your people are well trained and sincerely friendly. Thank you!,Positive,,,,,
Needs some updating.,Neutral,,,,,
a very warm and wonderful experience from beginning to end.,Positive,,,,,
"The toilet in the room wasn't bolted down properly so it crashed down every time you sat down. The room was really old and out dated in comparison to the rooms with the doubles. I was there on business and had several nights with people screaming and yelling in the halls, banging on the doors next to me, etc. Staff didn't bother taking into consideration the rest of the guests and let it continue from a wedding long past 2am. Absolutely ridiculous.",Negative,,,,,
the bathroom showers need handicap bars,Negative,,,,,
"AT FINAL DINNER AT HYATT ON SAT AUG  4, THE MEAT WAS TERRIBLE. IT WAS SO TOUGH I COULD NOT CUT WITH A FORK. I THEN SWITCHED TO THE PASTA STATION AND GO A GOOD .RESULT, BUT IT APPEARED THAT MOVE OF THE STAFF WAS TOTALLY UNTRAINED",Negative,,,,,
Nice suites.  Will book here again.,Positive,,,,,
"Lindsay is very accommodating helping me with my room stays.  My schedule changes frequently and never a problem Lindsay helping me out.  
Becky and her cleaning team doing a great job with my room stay and needs.
Becki, Jenna, Scott, Stacey, thanks for the great service at pub 33. They always serve with a smile and are always very polite.
Thanks again and always enjoy my stay with the Hyatt Green Bay.",Positive,,,,,
The young ladies in Starbucks weâ€™re so kind and made great drinks. The manager on the other hand was verbally abusive.,Positive,,,,,
The staff was attentive and very helpful. The room was clean and suited our needs. The air conditioning could have worked better . The food was very good.,Positive,,,,,
"Only complaint would be about the SLOW
elevators",Negative,,,,,
"The only feedback that I have regards the shuttle. Some staff members were knowledgeable regarding the schedule while others weren't. I called prior to reserve a shuttle from the airport and the representative indicated that there wasn't a shuttle at that time however 3 members on the same plane with me were able to reserve transportation. Luckily I was able to ride with them to the Hotel but there was miscommunication. The same thing happened when scheduling a time to leave the hotel when I checked out. 

My overall stay was great and the hotel is beautiful! Thank you for all that you do!",Positive,,,,,
Great job! I had a really nice experience during my stay.,Positive,,,,,
Iâ€™ve stayed several times over several years. Front desk never says welcome back. Online check-in didnâ€™t streamline process. Elevators are slow. Acoustics are noisy. Wi-Fi is not explained and no perks for Hyatt members. Omolete station is slow.,Negative,,,,,
We were scheduled to check in 8/3 I called and said we would be arriving very late probably 2 am bc we were exploring Chicago. Arrived with two young kids at 2:17 we were told that you didnâ€™t have a room for us. Sent us to a water park where the bed sheets were wet as well as the floor. Staff was very apologetic however as of 1pm today we still have not been refunded for our two night stay and I have emails stating that the refund was processed. The manger greeted us and offers us some water or a drink sentbuo a cheese plate. The gates to leave were not operable while we were there. Just a perfect storm of not great things. Our room didnâ€™t appear to be what I had paid for online either. Assumed we might be offered s few noghtbor two stay for future use or a food credit or something. Was pretty disappointed.,Positive,,,,,
"The woman at check-in was unfriendly and unhelpful.  Her demeanor was rude and unwelcoming and she seemed irritated by her job.  The condition of the hotel was worn and tired.  Overall, the experience was poor and it is unlikely that I will visit this hotel for our future visits to Green Bay.",Negative,,,,,
The elevators were very slow.  Otherwise everything was outstanding.,Positive,,,,,
Appreciated staff making an early check in possible so we could do a 30 mile bike ride.,Positive,,,,,
"Staff was awesome. Got me to a vegetarian restaurant (dry, thanks to the umbrella they gave me), and were delightful from check in to check out.",Positive,,,,,
The whole was very friendly. I visited with Tracy in the lobby and we had a great conversation. She is a real people person.,Positive,,,,,
From some unknown reason the person that cleaned my room did not like leaving face cloths. It was probably because she forgot..,Positive,,,,,
Excellent staff both at check in and for breakfast every morning,Positive,,,,,
"The maintenance came into my room while I was getting ready, he let himself into my bathroom because the toilet may have been leaking into the hot tub. The workers snide comments made my guests and I feel very uncomfortable. When I brought the issue to the front desk they were less than helpful.",Negative,,,,,
"billing errors, failure to follow through on commitments to fix the problems, the breakfast food was great, service was a joke, couldn't get a refill on my coffee, got a handwritten receipt because the credit card machine was down, then billing errors on the room and 7 hours later got a corrected bill.",Positive,,,,,
"Un soir nous avons trouvÃ© la chambre pas nettoyÃ©e  et le lit pas refait ; un membre du FO a envoyÃ© un agent de la blanchisserie... Le matin suivant un autre membre du FO nous a dit que le housekeeping Ã©tait fait si les agents ""avaient le temps"" ! Il est dÃ©sagrÃ©able d'avoir Ã  systÃ©matiquement demander le renouvellement de produits comme le gel douche. Un des agents de la rÃ©ception est particuliÃ¨rement dÃ©sagrÃ©able.",Negative,,,,,
"We stay at Hyattâ€™s all over the US and are Hyatt Residence Club Owners. The Hyatt Regency GB is unlike any Hyatt Regency I have stayed in. It was obvious when we walked in that it used to be an Embassy Suites, so not a typical Hyatt experience. For instance, the bathroom was very small and not what I expect from a Hyatt. Overall it is comparable to a Hampton Inn or similar hotel, but not what I expect from a Hyatt Regency.",Positive,,,,,
A/C a bit loud. Staff was very friendly.,Positive,,,,,
This hotel is very dated which makes it seems not so clean. Also no one can seem to explain the rewards program and when we are eligible for any rewards.,Positive,,,,,
"Parking is an issue, with a wedding reception going on there is not enough parking for guests who are actually staying at the hotel. People attending events that are not staying at the hotel should be required to park offsite not paying guests.",Positive,,,,,
There was a $25 +tax charge on my bill which was not explained to my satisfaction.,Negative,,,,,
Staff was exceptional especially Matthew!!  Service was wonderful throughout our two day stay.  Just a few suggestions.......having a complimentary Continentinal breakfast and a newspaper would be nice.  And PLEASE consider installing grab bars in the shower/tub area.  A real safety factor for your senior guests.,Positive,,,,,
breakfast buffet should be included in room cost,Positive,,,,,
"We did not receive housekeeping service on the second day of our stay.  Our room felt kind of ""stuffy"".  I'm not sure the air conditioner was working like it should have.  I love the rennovations that were done to the hotel.  However, I found it interesting that the bathroom door and vanity were the same as when the hotel was built in the 1980's.  Overall, we were satisfied -- just a few little glitches.",Positive,,,,,
"After a day of traveling, upon checking in, the guy at the front desk repeatedly tried to pre-sell me breakfast for 3 days - for 4 people. The breakfast was terrible so Iâ€™m really glad I didnâ€™t fall for that. 
I stay at Hyatt properties and others for business travel all the time. I expect the same professional treatment when traveling with my family and I certainly did not get that.",Positive,,,,,
The hotel reminded me of a Holiday inn from the early 70s at a premium price.,Positive,,,,,
Horrible noise until 1:30 AM. Security did nothing about it.,Negative,,,,,
The late night parking aituation was an unpleasant surprise. Your attendent made it worse by leading me to believe it was blocks away.  While its across the street i was traveling with small sleepy kids and had i not had a guaranteed reservation I would have left.   Parking continued to be messy as i had to pay $1 to leave (first 30 mins free and we left at 23 mins (i set a timer).  Parking is the reason you wont get repeat business from me.,Negative,,,,,
"This hotel is nice but needs some TLC.  For example our bathroom door had bad scratches on the inside...probably from a pet.  I am sure the hotel got a pet deposit that they kept for the damage but never replaced the door.  They also have ""Coolers"" instead of small refrigerators.  Who puts Coolers in a hotel room.  Ours must of had a small leak because the carpet was damp.   A little TLC is needed",Negative,,,,,
"I was so impressed with our experience.  We stayed for my daughter's birthday and had so much fun.  My daughter told a few of the people around the hotel that it was her birthday and that she was turning 4.  We came back to our room to find cookies and milk with a birthday card signed by the staff.  It was the sweetest thing and made her so happy.  The room was great and the beds were comfy.  The pool area is also really fun.  The only thing that I was a bit disappointed about was our meal at the restaurant.  I ordered the hummus that was supposed to come with carrots, cucumbers and pita chips but they only gave me pita chips.  Other than that our experience was truly amazing!!!!",Positive,,,,,
"The breakfast buffet was amazing!  My only complaint was the ham & cheese sandwich special you offered on Friday night.  The one & only paper thin piece of ham measured about 1"" x 2"" and didn't cover the bottom bun - the cheese was even less. Likely not the only sandwich like that, when I pulled from the warming case, several others felt like there was nothing in them (very light).  So bad I wouldn't even consider trying your pulled pork special.  Now unfortunately there are food trucks you need to compete with - keep that in mind next year.",Positive,,,,,
Room not ready at 3:00. A/C unit very loud. Breakfast 5-10 minutes late to open. Good gym.,Positive,,,,,
5:30 pm was when my clients got into their rooms. You knew it would happen and did nothing to prevent it. Poor room management of your convention.,Positive,,,,,
I hate being surveyed and emailed!,Negative,,,,,
Kolton at the front desk was very helpful since my room was initially not clean and ready for occupancy.  But everything was made well.,Positive,,,,,
"I sent an email this morning (7/26) regarding the differences in charges on the 2 rooms we used this past weekend.  I was dismayed about the fact that the checkout person was to have removed the two people from one of the rooms (pre-registered for 4 but only 2 were able to show up); however, she did not do that.  Subsequently, we were charged for 4 people not 2.  When my daughter got her bill, she did not realize this, so it was not addressed upon her checkout.  We are hoping to get a refund (all explained in the email I sent).",Positive,,,,,
More diverse choices for food at dining venues at Kitsune Kon would be wonderful!,Positive,,,,,
"Requested King-sized bed but not available. Unable to locate Hyatt World Accra despite giving associate the number. Gym not stocked with towels, headphones, etc. Impressive workout facility. Staff responsive when informed gym supplies were out.",Positive,,,,,
"I checked in around 10pm after long flights and no dinner and was exhausted. I was given a room that had not been cleaned. Beds were not made, garbage in the garbage cans. When packing up and going back downstairs with all my belongings, I was told about a wonderful breakfast in the morning that I thought was going to be complimentary for my troubles...however it was not.",Positive,,,,,
Not like any Hyattâ€™s Iâ€™ve been to before.  Very disappointed.  May consider staying in other line of hotels,Negative,,,,,
"There were many kind staff members who helped make our stay comfortable, simple, and relaxing! They did a wonderful job!",Positive,,,,,
Extra rack to hang drying towels,Positive,,,,,
"It was good. There didn't seem to be multiple wash cloths, though.",Positive,,,,,
"We were checked in by the sweetest person! I'm afraid I don't remember her name, but she had a trainee nametag on and she did an incredible job at getting us checked in and getting our parking validated. She was so nice and willing to answer questions, I just only wish I would have thought to take down her name because ya'll have a great employee on your hands.",Positive,,,,,
Best indoor pool area ive ever encountered on my travels.,Positive,,,,,
"The staff were generally pleasant and quick with service, and we enjoyed our stay. We will likely stay here again next time we are in the area.",Positive,,,,,
"Our room was comfortable and quiet, and the quiet part was HUGE considering we were there for an anime convention with a spirited horde of attendees.
The room was comfortable, but the water barely drained from the tub, which left us standing in the water throughout our showers.
Pub 33 offered tasty food and drinks, but there was almost nothing healthy on the menu--no salad, no unbreaded or unfried fare, no fresh veggies. A salad would be most welcome.
The staff was friendly, helpful, and altogether a delight.
Love the Hyatt!",Positive,,,,,
Staff were quite friendly and the hotel was nice. I had an amazing experience here. I only had two very minor complaints. The refrigerator in the room was not very cool. And we were in the pool late. The staff that asked us to leave at midnight was a little bit ruder at first but become more friendly after he saw we we're friendly. I think security should approach guests kindly first and take on more of a stern approach if the guests are resistant. But they probably have to deal with rude guests often at midnight so I don't hold it against the guy. Love my experience here and look forward to my next stay!,Positive,,,,,
"The staff was friendly, helpful and offered useful information. Was quick to notice when there was a problem and offer the best solution",Positive,,,,,
I wasn't recognized as a rewards member and my room wasn't ready when I was given email check in.,Positive,,,,,
Staff seemed inexperienced and actually rude. The woman who checked us in was nice and our room attendant was too. All others were clueless and rude. There was an Asian lady who was EXTREMELY rude when we checked out--arguing and ripping our voucher when we commented that they double charged us for parking. None of the staff knew anything about the 25 dollar package deal we purchased for breakfast etc when asked. After ten years of stying there we will not return. They did not have a clue we were repeat customers.,Negative,,,,,
"Although room was overall clean, there were candy wrappers left on the bar and the previous guest's parking receipt on the night stand.",Positive,,,,,
"I spoke with Carrie Jeska about this upon check out. It concerned my check in experience. I booked the room that day on your site. I drove 200 miles and turned on Google Maps as I exited the expressway, 10 minutes from the property. An ad popped up from Priceline, for $30 less than what I was paying. I showed it to the front desk clerk and asked him to match it. He said he couldn't, but he could cancel my stay, I could rebook it through Priceline, but would not receive points. I again asked him to match, as Hyatt would not have to pay Priceline a commission. He said that was not possible. So I booked it through Priceline while standing in front of him! In light of this, I think I should be given points for my stay anyway, along with a $50 future credit, as per the Hyatt best rate guarantee.",Positive,,,,,
Front desk staff is great,Positive,,,,,
"It seems odd that guests are charged for parking. I would never recommend your hotel to family and friends due to that alone. It's an unnecessary and odd charge for a hotel. I stayed for 3 nights on business, and for some reason the first 2 nights were charged to my company credit card (as I'd expected) but you needed a different credit card to charge my third night? Not sure what that was about. For a hotel as nice as yours, I expected something different, something better. My stay was fine otherwise but the oddities I mentioned above will keep me from ever voluntarily staying at the Hyatt.",Positive,,,,,
"when I made my initial reservation I selected an upper floor with a river view.  I was not able to check in on my first night, but did call to notify of my late arrival and confirm my reservation.  Yes when I checked in, I was given a room on second fl. which faced a brick wall - verify dissatisfied.  ...",Positive,,,,,
"The room was spacious and quiet. Beds were comfortable. However, a few small items would make it nicer. First there needs to be more towel hangers in the bathroom, also more washcloths.  The door and vanity was scratched and needed to be re-stained. The patio door only opens a crack, that's OK but put a screen on it instead of a sign warning about incects. Fresh air!  Thanks.",Positive,,,,,
"When I was at the motel I was very impressed with the courteous staff at the check in and check out, and when I had a problem with getting chocolate on the sheet by accident. You sent a person to my room who resolved the issue immediately.  However, during me time at the conference I was not happy with those that served the meals. I felt the meals were dry and not edible, and the staff serving was slow and not professional. I ended up going off site to get decent food. I would have thought that being a Hyatt Hotel, The service would have been much better. I don't think I will be returning to this hotel, even if the conference is held here again.",Positive,,,,,
I was shocked to see such a great hotel in downtown Green Bay.,Neutral,,,,,
We accidentally booked our room for SUNDAY night instead of SATURDAY night and didn't realize the mistake until we checked in.  I was completely horrified but the woman at the desk was extremely helpful and accommodating and switched our reservation to Saturday and found us a room.  We were very grateful and will be sure to stay again at the Hyatt next time we visit Green Bay.,Positive,,,,,
"The hotel staff were wonderful, the conference facilities were outstanding, and I absolutely loved the Atrium and my mini suite. My only suggestion, since you don't offer complimentary coffee in the lobby as I am accustomed to, is to provide half and half creamer in the guest rooms. I am allergic to that white powdery creamer, so I was not able to enjoy any coffee in my room while getting ready in the morning, which means that I was not fully alert at my conference until later in the morning, which makes for a longer day. Other than that, I was really happy with my stay. Thank you!",Positive,,,,,
"Great overall hotel - great location.  Parking situation has changed from previous stays it seems; didn't realize your parking ticket gets taken when you leave and come back - had to get re-validated but seemed like it was an inconvenience to the person.  Otherwise, enjoyed it!!  Will definitely be back!",Positive,,,,,
The marketplace was very expensive. $3 for a bottle of soda is a bit much.,Negative,,,,,
Hot tub waa.ice cold,Negative,,,,,
"2 weeks before I checked in I called to cancel one of my 2 confirmations and adjust checkin date of the second reservation. (Ended up only needing 1 room). When I got to the hotel, the check in staff said I was a no show the night before and would be charged a no show fee. (They did have record # for the cancel for other room).  I was then charged fees and the occupation tax for the night!  A night I did not occupy the room and I had adjusted!  I know it was my fault for not asking for an email confirmationwjen I made the changes - my mistake for trusting the front desk staff when I called directly to adjust 2 weeks prior to stay. Interesting that they had completed 1 of 2 requests).  I was very disappointed that the staff did not care nor did they even want to discuss their error once they found out I did not have an email confirmation. Not treated very well.",Negative,,,,,
parking needs to be better,Positive,,,,,
The young man at the registration desk was very helpful and pleasant!!,Positive,,,,,
Our room was clean and felt clean for the most part however the cleaning service apparently did not move the footstool to vacuum when they cleaned after last guest in that room  because we found cookies and crumbs under it when we went to move it to make up the pull out sofa.,Positive,,,,,
"Had a great time, enjoyed your Hotel",Positive,,,,,
"Getting out of the parking lot is a real hassle,ticket machine is hard to maneuver up to and when you
get to it it's out of order!!!",Negative,,,,,
"This was a great location for the conference I attended. The extra blanket/linens in the closet were very dirty... I had wanted to use the additional cotton blanket, but it was nasty.  I brought that the to the attention of the front desk when I checked out.",Negative,,,,,
The check in staff was not very helpful. I felt like because I was a woman he didn't want to help me. Your website needs to be updated to say that you have to pay 7 dollars for parking.,Positive,,,,,
We were staying 2 nights and our party had 5 people in it 3 of witch were children. The first thing we experienced was at check in they tried to charge us more than the quote we were given on line. Then when we went to settle in our room there was white stuff all over the floor we had to call house keeping to clean it up. All was good until the early hours of the next morning when the bench in the closet came crashing of the wall causing a ironing board to fall on to the bed hitting me. Luckily none of my children were not sleeping there!!!! So here we are rudely awakened  and we had to have all these people in our room then they decided  to move us down 3floors half way acrossed the hotel all in the wee early hours we had a full day ahead of us of activities as it was my birthday and the reason for our visit. The day continues  with crabby children  from lack of sleep and was just not a pleaent stay we chose this hotel for its beautiful and pleaent atmosphere  but that is not what we got. It was a failed  birthday experience  to say the least!,Positive,,,,,
"I booked the breakfast included rate. I was then charged for breakfast. The only reason I noticed this is my credit card received a $0.46 charge which I thought was odd. I did not receive an email receipt nor under-the-door receipt for my stay. I did access the receipt online once I noticed the charge. When I called I waited on hold and then was told it will be taken care of. I do appreciate that errors happen and appreciate it will be taken care of. I guess I'm expecting too much to have C.S. say they're sorry or acknowledge the inconvenience (even though it is rather small). Hyatt should strongly consider a policy guaranteeing some sort of receipt is sent out (just a thought), and have an email address available so the customer is not waiting to correct an error Hyatt made. Just a thought. I still love the hotel and will likely return. Just disappointed a bit by the billing stuff.",Positive,,,,,
"Hotel is nice.  Rooms could use some fresh paint as a lot of the paint it chipped.  Found a can of tobacco chew behind one of the doors when we entered the room. No complimentary breakfast was pretty disappointing as most hotels have this.  Charging guests who are staying over night in the hotel for parking is completely ridiculous!  I can understand charging guests who are there for a conference and not staying in the hotel to park in the lot, but charging your guests who are already paying for a room is just a poor way to run a business.  Don't nickel and dime your guests.  That alone is most likely why we will choose another place to stay for our next trip.",Positive,,,,,
"Not able to adjust temperature, Need a wastebasket in the ""tv room"", Housekeeping left a lot to be desired--BR not cleaned sufficiently, Guest Services booklet on how to get WIFI not applicable to Macs--the poor engineering guys (who were great (john and another) were great but could not figure out the problem. We called Apple support. They were awesome.",Positive,,,,,
"Room condition needs upgrading.  Bathroom door finish was all peeling off due to the bathrooms not having exhaust fans.  Tile was painted over--very tacky, this needs to be replaced.  Lobby is looking dated.",Negative,,,,,
"I would like to start off by stating that my family and I have stayed at this hotel multiple times a year for many years as loyal customers when we come into town to see family.  We have always been pleased with our stays but the last time we stayed we got charged for 6 breakfast meals even though our room rate was supposed to include some of them.  This time we had numerous things that disappointed us.  
1- there was a significant price increase of about $50 compared to previous stays.
2- we had to pay $7 for parking in a lot that is in no way secure
3 - we had to pay $1 to leave the parking lot when we went to run errands
4 - we werenâ€™t even able to exit out of one of the parking exits so we had to back out and use the other enterance/exit
5 - our room was mediocre at best (no bathroom fan, shower curtain was dirty, carpeting was loose and rippled through the dining/living room area)
6 - we called for a roll away bed and told one would be sent up right away, we waited for an hour and had to call again
7 - many rude and obnoxious pool goers with inadequate adult supervision which effected the ability of my younger children to enjoy or feel safe during their experience
8 - and truly the icing on the cake was that despite having a validated parking ticket when we had checked out and were leaving it wanted to charge us $18 to exit.  We again had to back up and return to the service counter to complain about this and told they would open the gate for us as we leave if we press the silver button.  Seriously after already having paid $8 just to park a freaking vehicle alone you try to get $18 more as we leave!

Bottom line the value of the room itself is not worth what is being charged and when I travel 4 hours with 4 kids the last thing I want is to feel like Iâ€™m being held captive by absolutely ridiculous parking fees.  For the room rate and all the added expenses we could have stayed at an actual hotel water park and had an overall generally more enjoyable experience than just a night in a basic hotel.  I am saddened to say that our trips to the area and our predestined days of staying at your hotel are going to be a thing of the past and we will need to explore other establishments that are more inline with our expectations and values.",Positive,,,,,
Great stay with personable professional staff!,Positive,,,,,
"I shared that my bathroom had not been cleaned - shower had previous guest's body hair in it, the toilet had not been wiped. The front desk was quite apologetic but I think something should have been offered such as a discount on room price.",Positive,,,,,
Would it significantly impact the hotelâ€™s profit margin to provide complementary coffee in the morning?,Positive,,,,,
"sheet was torn and worn.  Not the same things for breakfast each day, please.  Parking lot gate on east end was awkward because of the too sharp turn entree.",Positive,,,,,
Rooms are freezing and canâ€™t control temp.  Changing temp on wall unit does nothing.  $7 charge per day for parking for guests of the hotel is ridiculous,Negative,,,,,
"Very much enjoyed my stay, the central location was wonderful and it seems that there is a lot within walking distance to this fabulous hotel.",Positive,,,,,
Overall I thought the Hotel was staff was great they greated me by name.  I didn't get a chance to try the food service but if the hotel was awesome then I bet the food is too,Positive,,,,,

The food and service in the restaurant were very good.  We had a pleasant stay at the Hotel.  The manager was most accommodating.,Positive,,,,,
All was well.  Thank-you,Positive,,,,,
GreT first experience.  Since my flight schedukeclijely calls for more visits I look forward to them with pleasure. Thanks for a job well done,Positive,,,,,
"My biggest complaint is that check in is at 3:00 but my room wasnâ€™t ready until 4:00. Also, the coffee pot in my room didnâ€™t work. Other than that, I LOVED my experience and the customer service was outstanding.",Positive,,,,,
"Guest rooms overall were nice, however bathroom and prep areas were small and outdated. Parking a little confusing and no room on Saturday evening.",Negative,,,,,
Breakfast was too expensive for kids.,Positive,,,,,
"We had a very pleasant experience in your hotel. The fact that there is a second door in the room it was very quiet and peaceful in the sleeping area. I love the ""glass"" beverage glasses in the room.",Positive,,,,,
We appreciate that peace/quiet was requested & maintained after 10pm - especially given the holiday events right outside the hotel.,Positive,,,,,
Everything super,Positive,,,,,
The parking at Main Street was free and I was still charged for it and it was disappointing,Negative,,,,,
Love the breakfast buffet!  Customer service was excellent! Parking lot filled quickly and had to park a block away on 2 different occasions. Thanks for a nice stay!,Positive,,,,,
"I was a guest in room 513.  The room was expansive with no rhyme or reason.  A large door that went nowhere, BIG tv with nothing under it, several covered cords down the wall from the tv and sconces. Finally a large sectional that looks like it came from a low-end furniture store.  Very disappointing decor-not the Hyatt I'm use to!!!",Positive,,,,,
"The room was horrible,  NO window at all.  Next to an emergency stairway.    Loud,  and the room,  while large,  was not a suite!!!!",Negative,,,,,
"I feel the $10 parking charge was rediculious. It was mid week and parking was not a premium. I was also less than impressed that of the coffee in my room 2 were decaf coffees. The two people in my party do not drink decaf.  The hotel was beautiful, and the staff were friendly, but I would not stay at the Hyatt in Green Bay unless I was able to get it for the discounted price I received it at. Room was clean and as described.",Positive,,,,,
Kolton at front desk is always very polite. Only bad thing was slow shower drain in room 718.,Negative,,,,,

We love this hotel.  The only suggestion I would have is for the breakfast.  I think it would be better if it was self serve drinks.,Positive,,,,,
"Overall was quite pleased ,breakfast was very good room was comfortable .Only issue was between 12:30 A.M. and 2:AM .many guests during quiet period were yelling up and down floors to each other. I realize this is impossible to manage but that was only hiccup.Front desk staff was courteous respectful and extremely polite ,understanding,especially ms. Heather, she was so personable and answered many questions that i had.Very nice young lady.",Positive,,,,,
Love it. Always the place I choose when traveling.,Positive,,,,,
My family was asked to leave the common area as we were playing cards and having a few beers.  We had food arrive and were told we had to eat it in our guest room.  Iâ€™ll be staying elsewhere when I come back to Green Bay.,Positive,,,,,
Our suite was amazing! Canâ€™t wait for convention next year!,Positive,,,,,
"The room was not ready at 4:00 but should have been ready at 3:00. We had to wait about 15 minutes. Luckily there were some games set up in the lobby for our kids to play. We were compensated with a $25 credit for the wait. Overall, very happy and we will be back.",Positive,,,,,
"The parking stunk... not sure I would come back because of it.  We were there for our daughters wedding and having to park 2 blocks away in the ramp with flowers, dresses, etc was a true nightmare - had me in tears one evening after being on my feet for 20 hours to have to do this.   Hotel was great but parking - almost ruined it for me.   A lot of noise from lobby every evening at 1am - so not tranquil unless you were in the back of room.  Drinks in the bar were very overpriced.",Negative,,,,,
"My teenage son tried to sleep in the living room on food out couch. But he couldnâ€™t sleep because it was too noisy from sounds from atrium on first floor. He couldnâ€™t find a phone in that room so he didnâ€™t call the staff. It was quiet for us in the bedroom, but he barely slept and had to work the next day.",Positive,,,,,
The separate tickets for entrance and exiting parking lot was a nightmare. We had to park in the overflow lot. Some cars had trailers attached to them taking up two parking spots. The bathroom doors are worn and dirty towards the bottom of bathroom door.,Negative,,,,,
"Great staff,   The hotel was noisy, poor sound insulation.",Negative,,,,,
"The only drawback from this stay was the delayed check-in process caused by, according to some hotel staff, late checkouts fromt the previous evening.  It was a very busy weekend for the hotel and things like this will occurr.  An offer of a gratuity on part of the hotel would have been appreciated; a discount or even something as simple as a voucher for an appetizer and beverage at the in-house pub would have gone to showing a bit more concern for a guest experience.

We've stayed before, we'll stay again.",Negative,,,,,
I was assigned a room that was already occupied by a guest and I walked in using my issued key to someone changing. The manager apologized and his service recovery was appreciated and offered me Hyatt points to my account. I have not received them yet but I am sure if takes a few days. The hotel itself was wonderful.,Positive,,,,,
My friends called and were able to get early check in for free. I had to pay for early check in. A little disappointed about that.,Negative,,,,,
"There wasn't any mention of food availability at the hotel - only room order.  Guest service booklet does not mention the fact that there was a pub, buffet dinners available, etc.  Also, no mention that there was an area of food machines, etc.  Room accommodations were very good.",Positive,,,,,
Breakfast should start at 6 am for those who have to be at work by 7.,Positive,,,,,
"Because I make out reservation 5-6 months ahead of time and requested a handicap room, I was surprised to find out none were available when we checked in.  There were no railings or anything to hold on to in the shower and no mat.  I have fallen several times in the last 6 months and was afraid to use the shower after the first time.  Several of your employees went out of their way to assist us in getting to our room upon arrival.  We really appreciated that.",Positive,,,,,
The front desk staff are phenomenal and are always very friendly,Positive,,,,,
"Room was tired with trim coming off, one element of tap plumping was the wrong way round, TV guide required help, Space in bathroom created for 1 guest in a queen double meant for up to 4. External to the room Laundry room leaked and required support. Positively good living space in the room, best beds on our trip to date and the staff were responsive and good to engage with.",Positive,,,,,
Weâ€™re not told about parking expenses. Kristin was a life saver. Thank you for her,Positive,,,,,
"We were dissapointed with the quality of our room.  We expected more of the Hyatt Regency.  No towel bars in the bathroom,  Only one hook to hang a  wet towel on.  Bathroom very tiny.  No safety bars in bathtub/shower.  The view was a roof top and brick wall.  We reserved early and came two days early for the LWMS Convention and thought we might get a room on a higher floor.",Positive,,,,,
"One problem...after making reservations for a handicap accessible room six months ahead and confirming a day ahead I was told at check-in that no handicap rooms were available. When I indicated my written confirmation an appropriate room was found, but no mention that it came with a $25 a night upgrade fee. I feel that was dishonest practice.",Positive,,,,,
Please inform all staff (front desk and food areas) of a large convention coming in...,Positive,,,,,
"One day had to request replacement of towels & wash cloths as we used bath towels for wash cloths. Also needed to request cream, sugar and replacement of tea.  Wrote a message in the dust on bedside furniture. Would have appreciated having bottom sheets tucked in.  Left cafÃ© after having ordered 1 hour and 10 minutes (meatloaf sandwich & sweet potato fries w/water) and not yet receiving our food when having a meeting in 10 minutes.",Positive,,,,,
Check in staff and check out people were excellent.  Very willing to help you with all matters.  I use a walker and my husband a cane.  They took our luggage to our room for us.  We asked to be near the elevator so we did not have to walk the length of the hallway to get to the elevator and they put us right by the elevator.  Excellent staff help.  Thank you for your service.,Positive,,,,,
Not enough elevators. Also had Car broken into in parking garage. Also for 3 nights cost $36.00 for 3 nights parking when website said $5.00 a night,Negative,,,,,
your hotel is set up either with heat or a/c not both. so there was no heat because the air conditioning was in use. my wife who had surgery suffers from pain when it is cold and the nights were cold. they gave us a space heater which is noisy and interrupted sleep. also asked for additional toilet paper and when returning at night it never came. also one morn out of the room all morning..room not made up so we asked them to clean the room  at a certain time when we were once again leaving....we left for about 3 hours and once again it was not cleaned during about a 3 hour time frame when we once again left...never was cleaned that day....disappointing vs the other years we have stayed there,Negative,,,,,
"Our shuttle driver/concierge, Bill, was absolutely wonderful.  He went the extra mile for us when we had to mail a small package home.  Thank you Hyatt and Thank you Bill!",Positive,,,,,
"Really, the only complaint I have is that an escalator should be located where the steps are to get to the main room upstairs in the convention center. Or, even another elevator would help when there are over a thousand people trying to go up/down.",Positive,,,,,
"The suite was lovely and we appreciated the extra space when friends stopped in to visit. We would have appreciated a slightly larger bathroom - perhaps a double sink - to help facilitate getting ready each morning. But we did make use of the kitchen area for that purpose. All in all, quite comfortable.",Positive,,,,,
Our room was very warm - called for maintenance could not fix it - they brought us a fan.  Glad we only stayed two nights.,Positive,,,,,
thumbs up,Neutral,,,,,
"The lobby staff were excellent. Kristin remembered us and was so VERY friendly.  All your staff could take lessons from her.  However, 2 days our washcloths were not replaced and we had to call for them.",Positive,,,,,
"Housekeeping was very rude when we called for a hair dryer.  Took them an hour and 3 calls to bring us one.  Also our room was above the elevator motor room.  Yikes, it works alot:). It was very annoying to hear the cycle as often as it ran.",Negative,,,,,
"Access to the convention center was great. 
Bed was very comfortable.
Room was attractive.
Shower head was wonderful, but drains in tub and washbowl were VERY slow.",Positive,,,,,
"I was VERY impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel - both our room and the public spaces.  Saturday, one of your staff was cleaning the wrought iron railing along the atrium on one of the floors.  He wasnt just waving the rag, he was clearly cleaning with determination and doing a great job!  We also spoke with several of the housekeeping staff while waiting for and riding the elevators.  They were very friendly and had welcoming.  Great hotel and great staff!",Positive,,,,,
"Our four women staying at the Hyatt in Green Bay enjoyed the suite we were staying in for three nights. The beds were very comfortable and we enjoyed the separation of the living area.  Our concerns were with the small size of the bathroom and no vent or fan to take out the steam from showering. Once we called for extra towels, wash clothes and coffee supplies, a great plenty were available each day. The street noise was quite loud Friday and Saturday night but tolerable being on such a busy thoroughfare. The one other issue was how very low the toilets in the motel and convention center, and seldom an option during very busy times of the day to use the few handicap stalls there. That plus nowhere to hang up towels in our hotel bathroom. The staff was very congenital and helpful at all times. Thank you for sending the survey for being able to express our thoughts!",Positive,,,,,
"Very confusing way to enter the hotel. If our audio navigation had not said ""you have arrived at your destination"", we would not have known we were there. We drove around the block a couple times trying to figure out where the entrance to the hotel was. The hotel is not labeled well. We had to pay a hotel parking fee to register and then moved our car because the hotel parking lot is not large enough to accommodate guests.After we finally figured out how to get into the hotel, we enjoyed our stay, the nice lobby and large suite.",Positive,,,,,
What a great hotel!  Thanks for the lovely room and the great breakfast.,Positive,,,,,
"Check in and out was great.  
The gentlemen at the check in and out desk was very helpful and was very quickly helped.  It was a very comfortable stay.  We enjoyed it very much",Positive,,,,,
Curtain in room needs repair.  Had to ask for towels every day.  Had six people in our suite and though 6 towels were picked up each day ...had to ask everyday for two more towels.  Pull out couch was not very comfortable do to age.  Door to our room was hard to shut unless you slammed it do to the wood on the outside of the door coming loose and buckling.  This room needed repairs!!!!!  Room 432 at Green Bay Hyatt.,Neutral,,,,,
"Kristin, who checked me in, was fantastic. We wanted to pay with 3 credit cards and she had it all set up for the other 2 who came in later. She was friendly and wonderful.",Positive,,,,,
"At check-in we asked about dividing the bill in half when checking out.  When  I went to check out I was told the system would not allow the bill to be divided in half, only if the number of nights could be equally divided.",Positive,,,,,
"Had to get the room key reprogramed.  Room could use some pictures, too stark.",Negative,,,,,
Lovely setting on the citywalk. VERY nice staff!,Positive,,,,,
Could have used more restaurant choices,Positive,,,,,
"Person cleaning room was very inconsistent. One day we only sugar for coffee, no creamer.  One day we had all decaf coffee and no regular coffee.  One day we had no coffee cups.  One day the cleaning bottle was left in the bathroom.  This does not go with the quality of housekeeping a Hyatt Regency should have.",Positive,,,,,
The only thing I wish I could have had was a lock box in the room.  Most conference centers have them in the rooms,Positive,,,,,
"Main area of our room very nice w/comfortable beds, handy bar & sitting area; 2 out of the 3 meals served were tasty; bathroom could use upgrade of a towel bar; loss of water in women's bathroom a problem & elevators quit slow...understandable considering the large group being accommodated.  Overall a most enjoyable stay.",Positive,,,,,
Breakfast buffet is pricey for only a few options. Layout was poor. Didnâ€™t see bread and cereal options until I was on the balcony by the elevator when I was checking out of the hotel,Negative,,,,,
"On the surface our room looked great.  However, the carpet had a huge hump running from the front door of the room to the door between the living area and bedroom area.  Also, just to right and a few inches ahead of the sofa there was an extremely sticky area in the carpet. Don't know what it was but I laid a paper towel over it so we didn't step on it in our bare feet. Also, compared to the large space in living and sleeping areas, the bathroom was tiny.  And, there were several cosmetic things throughout the room that gave it a somewhat shabby appearance. On the other hand, the beds were super comfy and the small kitchen and island seating area were great.  And, special kudos to Kristen at the front desk.  She was super fantastic in every way.",Positive,,,,,
"Your Market was not able to handle a convention crowd efficiently between check in and our first session. The food was good and the ladies were pleasant but again, it was not efficient. Maybe more help at expected peak times would alleviate the congestion.  The restaurant experience was great.",Positive,,,,,
Could have more elevators,Neutral,,,,,
Room 512 does not have a operating fan in the bathroom - that was a big problem for the 4 of us guests.,Negative,,,,,
"We were disappointed that the door to the room squeaked, the bathtub drain was very slow, and there was no fan /exhaust in the bathroom. Got very steamy. It would have been helpful to know ahead of time if there was a microwave.",Negative,,,,,
"Overall our visit at the Hyatt was wonderful.  Room was great, beds were confortable, kitchenette was greet.  My only complaint was waiting for an elevator but since there were 1400 other people at our convention that couldn't be helped.  I do question the one elevator by the convention site though, or the huge stairway that had to be climbed in order to get to the main sessions.",Positive,,,,,
"Loved loved my stay at the Hyatt!! It was amazing! The barista remembered my drink and the way I liked it as well as my moms!! The room was clean. However, it would have been nice to have a working fridge rather then a cooler. Very disappointing. Also the room was a bit noisy from the atrium.",Positive,,,,,
"We checked out the night before and had a parking credit on our bill. I requested the clerk ignore the credit because it was all to come back to me, but he didn't and divided the total between the three of us which was not right. The other two guests got the advantage of the credit and it should have been totally mine. It was only $19.00, but the total room part should have been divided in three and then the credit should have been deducted from just my part. The clerk could not understand so the other two people also got the advantage of the credit.",Positive,,,,,
"I loved the rooms at Hyatt Regency Green Bay! Everything was well appointed, comfortable and clean. The only issue I had was that water and coffee wasn't restocked regularly. The staff was wonderful and accommodating, especially the workers inside the food market.",Positive,,,,,
"When I asked for a bottle of water the employee on the desk made it very clear to me that I was not on the right level to get another bottle of water.  This certainly did not engender good will with me.  The cost of the bottle of water is very insignificant compared to the poor impression I received when I was informed that I was not on the right level.  Also one morning when we received our coffee it was not fresh and I asked if they would bring us some fresh coffee.  They brought fresh coffee but wanted to charge me an additional $11.00 to replace the coffee that I had ordered and already paid for.  They eventually said they would not charge us after I complained, but this does not engender good will.  The majority of the employees were very friendly and helpful, but if you are in the hospitality industry all employees need to be hospitable.",Positive,,,,,
"Interior of the rooms are a bit dated and tired. For the two nights I stayed at the Green Bay hotel my room was never serviced, even after requesting in person at the front desk. In spite of relatively low occupancy I was assigned the noisy road side on a low floor when neither seemed needed or necessary. I didn't realize my room proximity to noisy Main Street until I was awakened by several trucks long before my alarm. Otherwise the front desk and breakfast staff were attentive and engaging. I come to Green Bay 1-2 times a month and the Hyatt is convenient for me. I will summarized by saying I was disappointed and the experience was below what I have grown to expect from Hyatt.",Negative,,,,,
"This was an outstanding experience and will definitely recommend this to many people. Entire staff was so professional and helpful in every area. Only problem was the Hyatt computer system was down and had to check back several times before information could be entered.  Desk clerk was very apologetic and polite each time. 
Very satisfied patron,

we were confused (plus others) on how to get around the KI conference center - not marked out. we asked at the desk there were no hand outs.  we saw others asking the same question,Positive,,,,,
"Staff response to my concerns were quick and efficient. My room (#419) was spacious, had a slight odor of staleness, and, first impression was neat and clean. However as I set up at the desk, I noticed a white substance on the floor and the desk chair had crumbs, residue and something sticky on the arms. Not at all pleasant. The  front desk sent someone up immediately to clean the floor and a new chair was brought in and the dirty one taken away. The only other issue I encountered was that there was no tea at the bar.",Positive,,,,,
"We had a non-smoking room and could smell cigarettes coming from somewhere. Ventilation system? Neighboring room? It was so strong that my husband pulled the front of his T-shirt his up over his nose to try and filter it. Not pleased, at all. Otherwise, the room was very clean, comfortable and classic.",Positive,,,,,
Loved it so much we are coming back with our daughter!,Positive,,,,,
The parking meters are frustrating to use. They never worked and we just had to kept getting new tickets.,Positive,,,,,
"I loved the Market Place they had in the hotel for coffee, soda, water and snacks. However, it might have been good to have a small selection of personal items in case anyone needed them. There is a CVS about a 10-minute walk from the hotel, but ...",Positive,,,,,
I was surprised by the lack of tourist businesses in the vicinity. Also. that the pool was in such a public area.,Negative,,,,,
"Two complaints: My room key did not work at first and when I went back to the desk, a staff person fixed it and handed it back to me without so much as a ""sorry about that"" or ""it should work now"" or ""thanks for your patience."" Nothing. I walked away. That seemed really unprofessional. Second complaint, the toilet in my room was dirty when I first entered. Other than those two complaints, overall I had a good experience.",Negative,,,,,
"All the breakfast meals were good and economical. The only exception was my first night I arrived, we ate at the hotel restaurant and the service was slow and the main entree was below par.",Positive,,,,,
"The plentiful counter space in the room was great. Check in was fine. However, when I told the rep that the stay wasn't showing up in my Hyatt app/rewards account, he assured me that they were connected. I, however, still do not believe that they are because the stay never showed up as an upcoming stay and once the stay was over it's still not showing up. I have a bad feeling this is going to require a lengthy call to customer service.",Positive,,,,,
Free wifi and parking was greatly appreciated. Staff made me feel very welcome.,Positive,,,,,
Well there Was that spider hanging from a Web near the elevators on the eighth floor you might want to check that out thank you,Positive,,,,,
Exceptional dining service for lunches/dinners at the Catholic Press Assn. Food was delicious and the staff was very courteous and accommodating.,Positive,,,,,
"The hotel in Green Bay could surely benefit by having a larger market area, and a gift shop offering basic traveler needs, and speciality items from Wisconsin for sale. I write this because visitors are forced to walk to Cvs Pharmacy or across the Fox River. There really isn't much across the river, so the hotel guests would welcome a place to pick poems or souvenirs at the hotel, especially those that have only limited free time.",Positive,,,,,
The staff was fantastic. The bathroom was very small and the drains in the sink and shower did not drain well.,Positive,,,,,
"The rooms were big and comfortable but really BROWN and way, way too dim. Please rethink lighting for work (desk isnâ€™t near the window so itâ€™s spectra dark there.)",Positive,,,,,
"Need towel rods. 1 hook not adequate for 2 people. Towels do not dry. Also, need notice on reusing towels, that Hyatt changes every 3 nights, which is fine but then need even more a place to hang towels.",Positive,,,,,
"i First want to commend the gentleman who made the omelettes on Thursday, June 14 and Friday, June 15. He is one of the twins. He was such a delight! Not only did he make a great onelette but he was a fountain of information about the area and really a great representative for the hotel as he also spoke about the wonderful Fourth of July event management puts on for the employees each year. Sounds like a family! He was friendly and informative and everything you could want in an employee! 
Also, my company won an award at an event there. I needed to ship it by mail. The front desk hade this the easiest experience I ever had. They were also very helpful about Wi-do connections.
All the maids were also super-friendly - smiling and willing to take a moment to chat.

It was a pleasure to work with your professional and multilingual staff.,Positive,,,,,
"Your friendly staff incl housekeeping are about all you have going for you here.   The food was absolutely terrible.   Bland, uninteresting and not many choices for room service.   For my order wrong twice.   No jelly or butter for toast brought to me then took forever to bring the butter and jelly.  
The doors on the wardrobe in my room wouldnâ€™t close all the way.   Broken and open the entire time.    Old and beat up.  Itâ€™s needs to be removed. 
I was there for a conference next door at the attached convention center.    Our conference food for our luncheons and dinners were bland and not well planned.  No green veggies only carrots and zucchini/squash.   I had a vegetarian meal and it was good only once.   Awful on June 15 at our luncheon - zucchini/squash thrown on top of linguine.   Odd and zero seasonings.   They served my gluten free colleague the same thing!  Pasta to a gluten free person?!!   The chef clearly didnâ€™t
know what he was doing.  Laziness. .",Positive,,,,,

I want to give special thanks to all of the ladies and gentlemen who worked so hard in the breakfast area when we were there. I want to thank housekeeping for the great work they did. We went to thank Steve the driver of the van who took us everywhere he could and especially to Walgreens to get medicine when my husband was ill. I want to thank Jim in security helping me with the ac problem. I want to thank Matthew the assistant manager for his special caring touch. And special thanks to bill the driver who got us to the airport. A truly special thanks to christen the manager who gave us a room with a good view on the 6 floor and her smiles and caring help when my husband got ill and halpiyus before then making sure we were safe well and good. The pollen count was high. Thanks to the entire staff for a great vacation. Hope we can come back.",Positive,,,,,
"We were very happy with a young male African American trainee who checked us in on Friday, 6/8/18.  He was kind and helpful; however, the young Asian woman training him was rude.  We had asked for early check-in, and when we arrived, she told us the computers were down, and she could not check us in.  She said it could take up to two hours - no ""I am sorry"" or anything.  The young man took over, apologized, and kindly checked the computer himself - we were checked in.  Please make sure he is commended.  He exemplified good customer service - he's a keeper.

This led to her having to pay $16 to get out of the lot.  If there is anything you could do about that it would be awesome.

Thank you",Positive,,,,,
I was a little surprised that the front desk had little to no specifics about the Bellin Run and that there was a shuttle right across from their hotel and they couldn't answer any questions about it.,Positive,,,,,
Are you kidding?   This hotel is awesome.  This is our preferred and only hotel to stay at ever in Green Bay.  Keep up the fantastic work!,Positive,,,,,
"Our room didn't have much of a view....a brick wall.  I was there for a conference and our breakfasts were plated.  We wished we had more options, such as fruit or granola. But overall, my stay was very nice.  The staff, were all very friendly and helpful, from the front desk to the waiter staff. Thank you!",Positive,,,,,
Told the front desk clerk about how squeaky my bed was when I was checking out.  Hope they resolve the issue for the next person.,Positive,,,,,
The bathroom sink drained very slowly.  There should be an exhaust fan in the bathroom.,Negative,,,,,
Overall the hotel is very loud.  Pool is freezing.,Negative,,,,,

We recently stayed in your establishment (June 9-10, 2018). This is an extremely frequent occurrence for us as we stay there 1-2 times per month. Generally we are very pleased with service and the accommodations themselves. However, during our stay this time we were extremely disappointed and with disgust. When going into our restroom to shower we first noticed hair all over the tub, following that we noticed facial hair all over the bathroom countertop. We went to turn on the shower and the water came spitting out in a yellowish brown color. That was absolutely nasty. Moving on to the main room, we went to make coffee and of course used the sink parallel to the coffee pot and again the water came spitting out of that faucet in a yellowish brown color. This absolutely ruined our morning as we love to sit and enjoy the common room with a cup of hot coffee. Again we generally love this hotel and spend a great deal of money there. We were extremely disappointed and feel as though this occasion needs to be addressed.

Generally a happy guest,

Great stay ! Love the express checkout process !,Positive,,,,,
"My experience was fine.  The only complaint I have is that when I tried to check in early on Saturday - they did accommodate me, but I felt the front desk person should have had a few more smiles than the somber look on her face.  I felt like asking her if she was unhappy with her job,  I stayed the night before with my sister who checked into your property on Friday and we had a very pleasant experience with the front desk person.  She went out of the way to make us feel welcome,  Besides this one complaint everything else was very enjoyable and will return to your property when we return to the area.",Positive,,,,,
"Was here for my son's wedding. The room was beautiful and the reception was perfect. However, some of the front desk and maintenance staff were terrible. The girl that checked us in (had an accent) came across really rude. Not exactly the personality you want checking people in. One of the guys at the desk said my room number out loud, that did not make me feel safe. The maintenance guy should not be out in view of the public, he was really rude. Stick to keeping him in back. Otherwise we really loved our time there.",Positive,,,,,
Our wedding party stayed in 4 rooms and each one of us noticed the poor quality of mattresses. The beds sagged in the middle and the frame in 318 is coming apart. The bed is the most important part of the stay. Its past time for upgrades...especially at the price. The staff was friendly. Parking in the ramp was very inconvenient.,Negative,,,,,
The parking situation for overnight guests was s nightmare on Saturday night and the front desk was very understaffed on Saturday overall.  I called the front desk for over 30 minutes and got no answer as I was looking for a hair dryer to get ready for a wedding.  I finally came down and found someone from housekeeping on my own to get one.   If I had been calling about an emergency or security risk I hate to think of would have happened,Negative,,,,,
I was at the hotel attending a conference.  The staff was wonderful to work with!,Positive,,,,,
"One of the very best all around accommodations ever that we have ever had for a Conference.  Super nice rooms & awesome staff. Loved the tiered meeting room set up.
All around it was a great experience.",Positive,,,,,
"Overall, a really nice stay.  Staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.",Positive,,,,,
"Great hotel, Great stay !!!",Positive,,,,,
"We really enjoyed our stay, a very nice hotel.  We came to watch our son run the Bellin Run, enjoyed
the pool and walked/biked to restaurants and bars close by.  I nice quick getaway.  Love the room!",Positive,,,,,
On Friday our group ate at the buffet around 8:00.  Our server was a  super gal.  She got our drinks and cleaned up our table.  She was smiling and really seemed happy to be there.,Positive,,,,,
"Beautiful hotel--good meeting rooms.  I loved the extra touches in the room: the Anti-bacterial wipe for the remote, etc--genius!  Also the magnifying makeup mirror--excellent touch!",Positive,,,,,
The hotel is starting to look tired inside.  The food (WI Co Treasurers Conference) was not impressive.  Green Beans one night were hard.  Carrots the next night - again hard.  Cooked vegis should be cooked.  I had Baked Cod.  The smell was so fishy that I was scared but it tasted okay.  But no butter or tartar sauce.  French toast when served barely warm is tough and hard to chew.  I know big groups are hard but that's what you do all the time so I was really surprised.  Also homemade chips should be crispy not soggy.  Maybe your head chef was on vacation.  Conference room was ice cold.  Some even went to their rooms and got blankets for the sessions.,Negative,,,,,
"The air filter in the room between the bedroom on bathroom need to be cleaned, VERY DIRTY!",Negative,,,,,
"I was very pleased with my entire experience at the Hyatt. Especially the personal attention I received from Marcus at the front desk. First, I had my little dog with me and trying to check in is difficult to say the least since I am in a wheelchair as well. Marcus made the whole process go smoothly and actually a pleasure. I was attending a wedding held in your Ballroom (Beattie, Menges) and EVERYTHING was perfect for their day. I would love to recommend your hotel to anyone.",Positive,,,,,
Your assistant front office manager - Matthew Hastreiter provided us with exceptional service!  We are amazed at the stellar service he provided us.  Your front desk staff were also exceptional.  We have stayed at many 5 star hotels and I can tell you - we have never been happier with the 5 STAR service we received at the Hyatt Green Bay!,Positive,,,,,
Your staff is WONDERFUL,Positive,,,,,
"My low score for customer service was due to calling and asking about getting an early check in and got attitude, then was hung up on.",Neutral,,,,,
The hotel was very nice. The only bad thing is the stuff in the store was very expensive. But the convienience was nice.,Negative,,,,,
"I really was impressed by the staff, from the front desk personnel, to the wait staff, and to the housekeeping woman who had 15 minutes to go on her shift, who shared the elevator and, when I asked if her shift was almost over or just beginning (1045 pm), she said almost over, but that she was just a little warm from working in the laundry and she really enjoyed her job. She meant it. It was refreshing to have all those people smile and make eye contact.",Positive,,,,,
"We have stayed here for probably 10 years when we attend our convention, and we have always had a great experience with the staff, and the rooms are great! Thank you!",Positive,,,,,
the air conditioner in my room/thermostat did not work. very hot and stuffy in room,Negative,,,,,
"Generally it was good. I had a problem with the heating in my room  - too cold. So the maintenance had someone set up space heaters and they worked. Also, the fridge buzzed -not so good .beds very comfortable .",Positive,,,,,
"We had a problem with dogs barking and howling until 12:30 in the morning. Dogs should not be allowed in the hotel. The door in room 407 between the 2 rooms needs to be sprayed as it squeaks alot. (easy fix). The elevator doors also need to be oiled, awful screeching sound when inside the room. The set up of the rooms in absolutely perfect. My husband could watch TV and not bother us sleeping in the other room. The bed is very comfortable. Overall, I would stay there again, but not a room by the elevator. Also, I'm not sure why I had to pay $18.00 to park there overnight. I thought it was cheaper for hotel guests.",Negative,,,,,
"Very nice,friendly.Clean",Positive,,,,,
"The only thing we could add is you might consider letting your guests know that when you have a big event like weddings there may be a parking problem. We went out for on early dinner, returned about 6:00 & all the parking spaces were gone. Otherwise, our stay was wonderful. Your staff is impeccably trained and give wonder service in this world where customer service is disappearing at a dizzying rate. They even handled the parking incident behind the scene in a way that made us look forward to staying with you again.",Positive,,,,,
My overall experience was wonderful I have no complaints at this time.,Negative,,,,,
We stayed at the hotel for a wedding. We noticed that there was 3 different wedding in the KI Center that night. We went to the bar around 11:45 p.m. and was told that the bar closes at midnight. One of the bartenders were not very friendly when telling us this. Why would you close a bar at midnight when you have 3 weddings at the KI Center. You know you could of made more money by keeping the bar open until at least 2:00 a.m. You don't want us to party in the hotel rooms because other guests are sleeping and I get that but it would have nice to sit in the bar and have a couple of drinks and talk to others in the bar.,Positive,,,,,
As always this was a fantastic stay at your hotel. The chocolates in the room for Anniversary was a very nice touch!,Positive,,,,,
Love the layout of the rooms! The sleeping area is separate from the â€œlivingâ€ area.,Positive,,,,,
The AC in the room never got below 71. It was just blowing warm air around. The shower had calcium and lime build up in the shower head.,Positive,,,,,
"Upon checking in I had an issue with the key card not working. It took two more contacts with the front desk to correct the problem,  which necessitated reprogramming the lock. The maintenance guy was great.  It was frustrating.",Positive,,,,,
Staff is unmatched at this hotel. First time staying here but will be staying here from now on. Hotel rooms need to be updated but other than that this place is solid.,Positive,,,,,
"There was an empty water bottle on a shelf in our room from a previous guest.  Lamps were dusty and could use a cleaning. It was impossible to get hot water in the kitchen sink, no matter how long it ran for.  Other than those small things, the room was awesome and far surpassed our expectations.",Negative,,,,,
"The room is clean, but a little dated in terms of decorating. My shower ran brown water for a short time, so not sure if the water heater was being worked on, or is just old. I stayed in room 201.",Positive,,,,,
Marlo Dino was exceptional and helped me twice with my luggage and conference loading and unloading.  His personal care and service was extraordinary.,Positive,,,,,
You have a Friendly staff that seemed happy to greet me and very proud to work for the Hyatt Company.,Positive,,,,,
"Outstanding service from all, every employee went above and beyond to serve our needs...Room was very clean, room service was prompt and courteous, front desk personnel was over the top in serving our needs..Only negative was the $7.00 per day parking fee but that would not stop me from staying there the next time we return to Green Bay we look forward to it...Mayor Ron D'Epifanio",Positive,,,,,
Matthew front desk clerk has a great demeanor and was extremely friendly and helpful,Positive,,,,,
Fresh towels every third day is extreme,Positive,,,,,
We love your Hotel and enjoy staying at it while we attend our Regional Convention for Jehovah's Witnesses each year.  Thank you for a refreshing place to recharge after our wonderful convention!,Positive,,,,,
Price would make me hesitant to recommend to a family member or friend; colleague - no hesitancy.,Positive,,,,,
Your signs read no event parking but a wedding party took all the parking spots for your guests so we had to go to the parking garage. It was very inconvenient. The reception people should have parked over there. It was so inconvenient when we were leaving the next morning and we had lots of bags to move. On a good note alll your staff were very professional and provided wonderful service! Thank you we appreciate your kindness!,Positive,,,,,
"1) why can't room temperatures be adjusted by occupants (e.g., to be higher during the day when away but cooler at night)?

2) your parking is inadequate and a reason I might not recommend the hotel - were there for 4 days and half the time (day and night) there were no spaces to park.",Positive,,,,,
There were only Pepsi products in the convenience store area.,Positive,,,,,
"I really like my recent stay in Hyatt specially the person at helpdesk is pretty friendly helped me understand everything. I will definitely highly recommend Hyatt services to my friends and relatives. Nice memories..

Thank You,

we had drinks and pizza at the bar every evening it was excellent and so was our service.,Positive,,,,,
"The gentleman who checked me in was particularly helpful and friendly.  I didn't get his name, but I think he was the only male staff member I saw at the desk on Tuesday 5/22 around 12:45pm.",Positive,,,,,
Love the suites.,Positive,,,,,
Matt did a great job with a rather complex check in on multiple accounts,Positive,,,,,
"I felt the room I was in was not as clean as it could have been.  There was some sticky stuff on the large bar counter when I arrived.  Housekeeping did not come to my room the next day after I had arrived so I had to find a housekeeper and ask for coffee packs for the in room coffee maker and I also dropped off my room trash at her housekeeping cart.  The third day of my stay housekeeping did not leave any toilet paper and I had to call the front desk for some at around 7:00 at night.  Each day before I left I fixed the beds myself and did leave a tip each day for the housekeeper.  I wish she/he would have taken a few more minutes to make sure things like coffee, toilet paper, plastic bag for ice bucket and counters were checked.  I have stayed here many times and never had any of these issues so I am assuming that the hotel may have just had some new staff being trained in or perhaps the hotel was short staffed and that is why the over sight happened.  Other than that the hotel is very nice and friendly.",Positive,,,,,
"We stayed in room 726 and it was very nice but the caulking around the sink was in need of taking out and re-doing. there was also an area in one area  where it was not getting vacuumed well. The bathroom door was in need of being painted and I also had another person in an other room that had the same feeling that her door was in need of painting or replacement, your hotel is very nice and I have stayed there other times and one other thing noticed is some of the pastry seemed old / dried out / not fresh. I feel you should have a modified breakfast which would cut the cost. Also $9.00+ is to much for a drink you are chasing away customers. I am a property manager and worked for some of the larger companies in the nation and you need to re-think your food rates and drink rates last but not least bathroom doors are eye sores.",Positive,,,,,
"Overall, our experience was less than satisfactory! The maintenance man knocking on our door and telling us we caused water to rain into the room below us was the kicker!",Positive,,,,,
The slow elevators are brutal.,Negative,,,,,
"The entire staff was excellent, except when I went to check out Fri morning and a gentleman was standing at a check in / check out station. There was a girl who was engaged with another customer and the gentlemen who was not busy totally ignored me. I did not appreciate that",Positive,,,,,
I had to rate my room lower than I would like. I found an old sock in the room and a washcloth placed over the electrical cords/ socket behind the bed stand. The toilet also gets stuck and â€œrunsâ€.,Positive,,,,,
"The gentleman who checked me in (tall, young, African American) was very helpful. I was tired and had parked in the wrong lot. He gave me a map to show me how to find the correct lot. I also asked if I could have a quiet room and he gave me one on 7th floor which was nice and quiet. I forgot to leave a tip for the maid the first day but saw her in the hall and I told her I would remember the next day. She said no problem. I did remember, too. The gal in the little snack shop was also nice. I tried the computerized check out and that went well. The two bottles of complimentary water were a great idea, especially since it was hot. Also, my friend had an older dog she needed to bring with her so I was glad you accept dogs.",Positive,,,,,
Thank you for allowing my dog to stay with me!  Staff always gave a warm and genuine smile and greeting.  Very clean facility and rooms. Very impressed and will suggest your hotel for future events and trainings.,Positive,,,,,
"I enjoyed the food at the restaurant, however, I've found that the portions are so small on most of the entrees.  And they don't always contain what's on the menu.  For example, the walleye stated that it came with garlic mashed potatoes and when it arrived, it was whole, small red potatoes.",Positive,,,,,
"If you ""partner"" with the marathon, you should expect late check out requests and be able to accommodate those. I requested one and the response was less than professional from the person checking me in. I was given an extra hour, but even that, for a slower runner like myself, wasn't enough. Don't partner with the marathon if you aren't able to accommodate these requests. It made my experience more stressful than it needed to be...not to mention less fun. As a slower runner, I had to rush back to the hotel after I crossed the finish line and wasn't able to stay for the finish line food and festivities.",Positive,,,,,
"After checking in, I learned that : A) I would be charged for parking, B) There was no continental breakfast,
but if I wanted a light breakfast, you would charge me $12.50. 
In addition, in the morning I went to the lobby to get a paper and a coffee, and found out that you don't even provide coffee for your guests. You have a coffee shop in the lobby where I had to pay $3 for a cup.
This is a horrible way to treat guests. you rented me a high price room, then tried every way you can to stick your hand in my wallet.

The hotel was recommended by relatives in Green Bay, and I will tell them never to do so again.",Positive,,,,,
Leftover hairs in the sheets and pillows. Bed was clearly not changed between guest stays.,Positive,,,,,
"Highlight here was the gracious staff - front desk & breakfast attendants made this a happy & welcoming experience.  Yes, the road noise was clearly audible in the room.  Never had such a small hotel bath room-no towel or clothes hooks/racks.",Positive,,,,,
"Matthew (manager) was a wonderful help to me correcting a creditt card. I told him I would look him up when we arrived and what a pleasant person he was. he asked me if he could be of any other assistance to please let him know. all the staff at the front desk was fabulous! kudo""s to your staff going over the top for our group.",Positive,,,,,
There werenâ€™t enough paid parking spaces for all guests so people had to park in a free lot after paying the daily fee if your parking lot.,Negative,,,,,
Check out took forever. Parking was a pain.,Negative,,,,,
Sauberkeit kÃ¶nnte besser sein. DuschvorhÃ¤nge sollten frisch gewaschen und fleckenfreien sein.,Neutral,,,,,
enjoyed the bar and food at the bar.  did not care for the breakfast.  it seemed overpriced for below average tasting hot food and the 3 dollar extra charge for a soda made my eyes bug out of my head.,Positive,,,,,
The pillows on the bed were extremely hard!  Most hotels offer a variety of pillow choices from soft to hard. Wish you did also!,Positive,,,,,
"Overall I enjoyed my stay, my dissatisfaction part of the stay was the shuttle bus service. Was only able to use it once,  for a trip to Shopko Hall....I understood the specific times that the bus was available, upon requesting for a pick up, I was told it would be a half hour wait, possibly more...which I was ok with....but then without hesitation,  the person I was speaking with from your hotel, suggested that I should grab a cab back to the hotel, because there "" might"" be customers that have to be picked up at the airport....the sound and tone in their voice, made it seem as though I was not important enough to be picked up, and I was not as an important customer of the Hyatt as maybe 
person who was being picked up from the airport was. I ended up getting a cab back to the hotel. Upon my arrival at the hotel, the shuttle bus was parked and the driver was still on duty.  It was before 10:30 pm. Other then that, only one other night I ordered room service and they forgot about me, I waited a half our, before I called again. The person who answered, apologized, and said the bar got busy. And that my food would arrive in ten more minutes....it did, the food was good, but I didn't receive everything I ordered. After being frustrated with the wait, I decided to not even bother calling again. I was not charged for this meal.....and finally, the sheets on my bed made me itch....after looking more closely at them, there was particles of I have no idea actually what it was all over them. The sheets were not crips and clean, I know that. I have stayed in many hotels/ motels to know the difference between fresh sheets, and sheets that have been slept in or are of questionable standards....those sheets were of questionable standards. Would I stay again? Probably, but the rates you pay for a stay at your hotel, do not reflect the excellence in customer service that your hotel is trying to potray.",Positive,,,,,
It is pretty hard to believe that a $200 dollar a night room does not come with any type of basic continental breakfast. Asked the staff and it is an added package. Would have stayed next door at the Hampton had I known.,Positive,,,,,
"I was a little taken back by the way I was talked to when checking in. I had some questions and wasn't prepared for the harshness coming back from the woman checking me in. Our room was beautiful but very warm. We called down and were told to lower in at low as possible and when that didn't work we didn't get any other responses. The size of the room fit our needs perfectly though. The pool and sprinkler area were definitely a highlight for our children. The woman who checked us out of the hotel was very wonderful and seemed concerned we didn't get the heat situation figured out, which was much appreciated.",Positive,,,,,
There was hair in the shower.  Breakfast is over-priced if guest has to pay.  Facility is convenient and well maintained.,Positive,,,,,
"I did not receive a water bottle every day due to the fact I am a discoverist.  I had to leave a note for the room person, still only received the water bottles on the one day I left the note.
Room was cold could not turn up the temperature above 70 and the wind was blowing a lot and it was a cold day.",Negative,,,,,
Hotel rooms need series renovation and upkeep.,Positive,,,,,
Everything was great~~the front desk was fantastic and the maids were great especially Mary~~ she really really cared that everything in our room was just the way it should be.  I was sorry to see Amanda leave from the front desk but Zanna and I think it was Nicole were fantastic and made sure that they took care of us just like Amanda did.,Positive,,,,,
"We were put in a corner room, The view from the door was a non-descript wall. The room itself was big but basically square. Toward the center of the room we had a round table that you could stand up at and this is where the coffee maker was. No electrical outlets anywhere near it. So, it was basically a show piece. We couldn't get the air conditioner to shut off. It was noisy and ran all night. For May 12th in Wisconsin, it got a little cool in the room. Finally, the vanity in the bathroom was very small. Not enough room for the wife's makeup kit, much less my shaving kit.",Positive,,,,,
beautiful hotel.,Positive,,,,,
"Let me start by saying that I love your hotel.  Noely checked us in, and was a delight to work with throughout our stay.  She did everything she could to make our stay comfortable, enjoyable, and memorable. 

When we arrived, the hotel was almost at full occupancy.  It was obvious that our room had not been rented in a while due to the level of dust on the counters.  With that being said, the hotel was very well kept and attended to, despite having so many people there.

The elevators need to move and set faster.  They are entirely too slow.  I took advantage to the pool area daily, and was surprised at the lack of upkeep during the day.  Guest left garbage and towels on the tables, chairs, floor and even in the pool.  I felt it necessary to clean it up myself.  Saturday night, there were some intoxicated individuals in the pool in their underwear.  One went behind the wall by the hot tub and was vomiting.  I would recommend that someone from management or security make more regular sweeps of the area in order to keep it neat and orderly.

The last thing I would ask is that each room be allowed to have individual control of their HVAC system.  It was too warm in the room.  The heat was on, and the only way to remedy that was to open the window in the bedroom to cool it down.  

We enjoyed your breakfast buffet two of the four days we were there.  The food was phenomenal, and your staff was incredibly nice and attentive.  

I will certainly stay at the Hyatt Regency the next time I am in Green Bay.",Positive,,,,,
I like your Hotel.,Positive,,,,,
After asking about early check in when I arrived they just said maybe. Our next guest arrived and checked right in. I went back to ask again and was then checked in. I also asked for a cart for my luaage when leaving and both ladies just pointed to the door. After checking there was no cars. It seemed as if it was a major task to get out an extra cart.,Positive,,,,,
We realized in the middle of the  night the furnace wasn't working.  We could turn up the thermostat but the heat never kicked on.  We froze all night and didn't sleep much!  My husband didn't sleep and left at 3:30 a.m.,Neutral,,,,,
Excellent customer service and a very clean room.,Positive,,,,,
"A couple glitches with maintenance of the room.  Vent cover clips not holding that up so that fell during the night which was startling.  Again during the day.  I did alert staff at check out.  Taking a shower always resulted in the fire alarm in the room going off.  That must not have been connected to alert anyone as no one came to the room.  Fortunately no emergency, just annoying.  Also alerted staff at check out regarding this.
The real upside was the customer service we received from Matt Hastreiter.  We were alerted to an issue with an expired Gold Passport number.  We had no clue of this and have been giving the same number to other Hyatt properties with no one catching that we apparently were not getting credit for previous stays.  Matt called us while we were on the road home and gave us good information on how to get this straightened out and get credit for a stay on Kauai earlier this year.  We were very impressed with Matts follow through.",Negative,,,,,
I applied for an upgraded room via email ahead of checking in but nothing was mentioned at check-in. The overall hotel is clean but is major need of renovation. My room also need a good vacuuming and cleaning as their were cobwebs in the corners.,Positive,,,,,
"Everything about our stay was great with one exception. The technology for setting up an automated wake up call didn't work, Unfortunately what did work was the alarm clock! Housekeeping didn't check and as a result, the alarm went off at 6:00 thanks to a previous guest. Having arrived around 1:30 am because of storms that delayed our flight, waking up at 6:00 was painful! Except for this one incident, everything else was great. My wife and I love the hotel and will be back again soon.",Negative,,,,,
"Becky and her staff in the morning do an excellent job.  Always friendly and service with a smile.
As always the staff at the bar does an excellent job. Very impressive to see both departments work as a team. This is an indication that starts from top down and believing in quality service.",Positive,,,,,
The bathroom was small & had no ceiling fan. Couldnâ€™t adjust the room temp.. too long of a walk back to the room after the wedding reception.,Neutral,,,,,
General Manager Matthew was kind and did a wonderful job in a professional way working with us.  We greatly appreciate his efforts and working to make the wedding weekend of our son's a wonderful experience.,Positive,,,,,
"Hyatt recently began welcoming dogs. We have stayed at the Hyatt on Main several times in the past several years, and have been very satisfied with the cleanliness of the room. This time there were dog hairs in several areas of the room, including on the bed. The desk personnel said a dog had not been in that room for two weeks, but the hair was definitely from a dog.
Perhaps Hyatt could designate specific rooms for pets. We are not ""animal people,"" and found it unpleasant to have to remove pet hair.
On the plus side, my husband had to park further away because the parking lot was so full. Matthew, the desk clerk on duty Friday night, helped carry our luggage so I could wait for my husband, and offered me a bottle of water. Very kind and considerate.",Positive,,,,,
Room was too warm and had trouble regulating heat downward.,Neutral,,,,,
"Check in/out was great no issues and fast, very helpful front desk offering directions etc! Room was dirty, dusty and A/C wouldnâ€™t work properly. I had to clean the surfaces of dust to place my bags and clothes down. Room smelled musty too humid. There was no light roast coffee in room. I would hesitate to stay here again. The breakfast was par at the most. Grapes hadnâ€™t been washed and could wipe dirt off with my fingers. Hash browns were soggy, omlet  bar wasnâ€™t staffed and took forever to have an omelet made when it was finished it was a pile of soggy eggs with ingredients mixed in. Service was slow to get drinks and refills and bill and the coffee was burnt had cooked to long. Front desk experience nice, there was a bed though sheets had holes in them and there was some food options but definitely not a wow experience.",Negative,,,,,
Extremely kind and professional front end staff. Thank you!,Positive,,,,,
The front desk staff was excellent. Checking in and checking out was easy and fast.,Positive,,,,,
"The bath tub drained excellently when showering. It's a little thing, but makes a big difference. Thank you.",Positive,,,,,
The food was fine but the staff had an EXTREMELY DIFFICULT time keeping the food available both at the luncheon and at the buffet breakfast. Would have liked to have pitchers of ice water available at the tables also.,Positive,,,,,
The only suggestion I would have is to look at the speed of your elevators and more hotel parking. Thank-you for a great experience.,Positive,,,,,
"Our sleep experience was terrible.  The bed mattresses were in very poor condition.  The mattresses were bowed so bad that you rolled to the middle.  The bathroom door actually had a huge gap at bottom of door and was in overall poor condition.  We were so disappointed in the Hyatt Regency Brand, couldn't believe that Hyatt had their name associated with this hotel complex.",Negative,,,,,
"There was some kind of noise during the night. It sounded like someone was power washing the exterior of the building but truly I know that wasn't happening at midnight. It would start and then stop like it was cycling or a time. 
The room was far to warm for me. I turned the heat down to 61 but it never got below 67. I don't know why.",Positive,,,,,
"The staff were very friendly      
The room was clean but the thermostat was confusing and the fan was noisy.  Had to turn down the temp setting to keep the fan from coming on while sleeping.  
The bathroom was small, the toilet is on the verge of running after every flush.  
We noticed on one day the bed wasnâ€™t made for us and a piece of paper on the bathroom floor was still there after â€˜cleaningâ€™   It appears all that was done was replace towels and tea bags.  
The shower was very nice, the water pressure and temperature were great.",Positive,,,,,
"Christine was most courteous and thoughtful at check in and several times afterwards.  The food at the Pub was great; however, our Breakfast in the lobby was not so (tough and cold pancakes and French toast).  In addition, you need to have grab bars in the shower and the toilet is definitely not ADA-compliant.",Positive,,,,,
The only complaint we have is about the heating/cooling in the room.  It was EXTREMELY loud each time the blower kicked on.,Negative,,,,,
"Matthew at the front desk is a rockstar! He went way out of his way to help me with copying and scanning at a moment where I had no other option. I was trying to close a deal, and he made it happen. Many thanks!",Positive,,,,,
"Always a pleasure coming to the Hyatt and holding events.  The staff is outstanding, courteous and patient!",Positive,,,,,
The front desk was very accommodating in moving me to a different room when I mentioned there was a pair of underwear left on the floor of the bedroom,Neutral,,,,,
Rooms are in need of updating.Filter on Ventilation system needed to be replaced.Beds were comfortable and rooms were quiet.,Positive,,,,,
"The elevator situation was a nightmare. I waited over 10 minutes to get from 3rd floor to ground.
Front desk staff were knowledgeable and helpful but not friendly or personable.
Loved the room and amenities for the price.",Positive,,,,,
"Was a great experience, attended a conference at the KI center and the room was so convenient.",Positive,,,,,
We were very pleased with our stay at the Hyatt and will definitely return!  The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.  The hotel was very nice.  Breakfast was good.  Thanks!  See you soon! :),Positive,,,,,
With limited parking a large truck towing a boat should not be allowed to take up 5-6 parking spaces.  Due to a lack of parking I was forced to park in the street which was not a big deal until I received a parking ticket as Green Bay does not allow for overnight parking on the street (a law I had never heard of before and was not indicated on any signs).,Negative,,,,,
Overall a very nice hotel.  Rooms just could use some updated painting and bathroom is very small.  Loved the idea of all rooms being a suite.  Very suitable for a long weekend especially a dance competition.,Positive,,,,,
"The lobby is great! Especially loved the games set up for the kids to play-connect for and bean bag toss.
The pool was very nice and loved that it was warm enough for adults to enjoy as well.  The breakfast buffet was great, we all loved the made to order omelets.  The restaurant was good, the pizza was not the best, so I would improve that -more sauce/cheese it was dried out and overcooked.  The drink prices were very high as well $10-12 per drink.  The waiter was very nice and great with a family.  The room size is great especially when you are there with other families as your room has a separate visiting area so the kids can go to bed in their room early.",Positive,,,,,
"At first I was not pleased that I had to go across the street to park in the 4 story parking facility.  But, later I was please that I had to.  I parked on the 2nd ramp near the sky walk and found that to be more accommodating.  I really enjoyed my stay at the Hyatt.  The staff was so nice and friendly.",Positive,,,,,
The elevators are extremely slow.  At the busy times if the day people had needed to have 5 or more times for the elevators to open in front of them before they could get on to go to the floor they desired,Positive,,,,,
Enforce the pool rules of no kids after 10 pm.,Neutral,,,,,
"The bathroom fan did not function (or was not there?) so the room got very humid and stayed that way.  The elevator was super duper slow.  Other than that, we really liked the facility.  The staff was tremendous!",Positive,,,,,
"I hated that I could not control the temperature in my room.  It is miserable to be cold in your own room.  Also, did not get water restocked on the second day of our stay.",Negative,,,,,
Parking was a problem. No room at the inn.,Negative,,,,,
Not having an exhaust fan in the bathroom of the room is ridiculous. Having to pay for parking is unacceptable.,Negative,,,,,
"purchased pizza from the Market last time and got a MUCH better pizza with thick crust - not nearly as good this time and was thin crust...neither time was I asked what crust...my room did not have a single wash rag only towels...I was there for a dance competition and people around me were talking about the different rates that they paid for their rooms, I am very disappointed that I had to pay way more than any of them and some of them called after I did.  I paid $105 for the room and most everyone paid $87 that booked before me...I was told that I had to pay $139-then the manager brought it down to $119-when I mentioned that I had a friend that just booked less than an our ago was able to get the room for $87 he brought it down to $105...I was told it was cause of the lack of rooms left (even though I called into the corporate Hyatt and was told there was none left and called the hotel and was told that and then the manager conveniently found me a room...that is really frustrating when I had someone else say they booked two days before coming and got the price at $85 and I was told I had to have a higher price because there weren't many rooms left...sorry not really happy. :(",Positive,,,,,
Had a wonderful time there!,Positive,,,,,
"We were very impressed with our accommodations--very clean with spacious rooms. There was a large dance competition going on, so we appreciated the foresight to place us into a corner room where noise did not travel. I also really liked having the ability to check out online. 
When we got to the hotel to check in, there were absolutely no parking spots and no direction of where we could park. We parked up by the curb and my husband ran inside to figure out where to go. While we were waiting someone rear-ended our car because the hotel's bus was parked by the entrance and another car had parked there making it extremely hard to pass through. 
At breakfast the next morning, we had a larger party (10 people) and the wait staff seemed annoyed to have to find a space that would fit all of us...even though smaller parties were being seated at huge tables. This was frustrating as the rest of our stay had been excellent.",Positive,,,,,
The elevators were a bit slow this visit,Positive,,,,,
"On its face, the hotel seemed nice - staff greeted me well, helped me check in when the online process did not work, got me in earlier than normal check in time and appeared generally appealing.  My two biggest complaints boil down to the cleanliness (really, the lack thereof) and the peacefulness of the room.  More specifically, it appeared that the floor had not been vacuumed when I first checked (as I found a piece of paper - albeit small - on the floor).  I decided to do an experiment and left the paper on the floor; sadly, it was still there two days later.  Additionally, it did not appear to me as though the bathroom sink was cleaned very well.  Worse yet, there was a shelf outside the bathroom (about knee high) where I placed my luggage and, later on, I discovered that the whole shelf was covered with a dark liquid type substance which ended up on a couple of bags and my luggage but does not appear to have gotten onto any of my clothes.  I wiped the area with a wipe and the wipe had a dark brown hue to it from the quick clean I performed with the wipe.    I would be happy to share the picture with you if so requested.  

As for the peacefulness, there wasn't any.  The bed seemed to be old and dated and to solve the problem it appears a mattress pad was placed over the old squeaky bed.  That gave me the perpetual feeling of being in a parabolic pose with my mid-section higher than my head and feet.  Worse yet, the design of the building is questionable.  Thursday night into Friday morning, the Green Bay area started receiving rain and, as it rained, the drops hit the aluminum flashing outside the patio door (rather than falling to the roof below) and echoed throughout the room.  It was so loud that I was awoke at 2:30 am and could not get back to sleep with the constant noise.

I've had the opportunity to stay at many hotels and resorts in my career and I can honestly say that this is one place I would never want to stay in again.  It is quite disappointing given the Hyatt brand and how, generally, I have been pleased with my stays at Hyatt hotels.",Positive,,,,,
There were feather pillows. I am highly allergic to feathers.  I requested other ones and they had run out.  They had to go to another hotel to get some.  My question is:  why do you have feather pillows when there are so many allergies.  Why not have non allergenic pillows???,Negative,,,,,
"Long story short, it took 3 different rooms to find a bed with clean sheets! Totally unacceptable. Finally we stayed in the last room even though the pillow cases still had nasty hairs on them because we were exhausted by then and still hadnâ€™t eaten dinner. Is it too hard to ask for a clean room?! The mgr took care of the room but still completely unacceptable to check into a hotel and have to change rooms multiple times due to sheets obviously not being changed! 
On bright note, the pool was nice and our server in the pub was great.",Positive,,,,,
Room could have been cleaner.  I had to wipe off the counter chairs full of dried ketchup and counter top in room.,Positive,,,,,
The hotel was beautifully kept clean and inviting. All was excellent.,Positive,,,,,
Cleaning staff didnâ€™t replace shampoo and water- other than that all was well,Positive,,,,,
"As usual, the bar and restaurant was expensive.  Room was great and clean.  Hotel in great condition.  I was there for a conference.",Positive,,,,,
"For the conference I attended last week in Green Bay, I earlier reserved three rooms over the phone, two rooms for a one night stay and the other room for two nights.  The room #313 which I stayed in was a corner room, King, oversized bathroom, non smoking, flat panel TV sounded great at a reasonable rate.  Upon entering the room it was very spacious but lacked one essential amenity, no window, I have personally not stayed at any hotel where a room did not have a window/balcony.  I can't believe that can even be legal, wouldn't that be a safety issue should a fire break out (no alternate escape route) or what about people that are claustrophobic, it felt like sleeping in a closet.  Had I known that room was setup that way I would of refused it, even if it was the last available room I would of went to another hotel.  I'm very disappointed not being made known of this issue upon booking. I will think twice and be sure to ask more questions before making another reservation at the Hyatt.",Positive,,,,,
The only thing I didn't like was that I could not adjust the room temperature .,Positive,,,,,
"The coffee mug brought to my room was dirty. It has a residue all over it. 
Additionally, the first room I was given didnâ€™t have a properly shutting or locking patio door so I had to switch rooms.",Neutral,,,,,
Supper was very good.  Breakfast was not very good.  I was concerened about the sausage links being under cooked.,Positive,,,,,
"This was the best hotel we have stayed at. It was the first time I could check in right away, rooms were larger and the staff was awesome. Thanks.",Positive,,,,,
Conference of younsters was going on when I checked it.  Little did I know tho that they would turn into loud mouths until 11 pm!  Curfew should of been at 9 pm since others ( myself ) were there to get some rest.  Shame on the adults or supervisors for allowing such loud behavior to go on in a place where others come for some sleep.,Negative,,,,,
Matthew at Check in is an outstanding employee.,Positive,,,,,
"I was very satisfied with my room and the wait staff. Room was clean and kept up very nicely. However the in house bar restaurant has a lot to be desired. Over priced, lack of selection and over all poor quality. Would not recommend this eating establishment at all.",Positive,,,,,
We were very pleased with our stay at the Hyatt.  Everyone was very friendly.,Positive,,,,,
Still waiting for my check out statement I was told it would be e-mailed to me.,Positive,,,,,
I was unable when I checked in because I had to drive around and around to find a parking spot.  It took about 10 minutes before someone left before I could get their spot.,Negative,,,,,
"Front desk staff was very friendly, and helpful not only regarding me personally, but our group, which was there for a large breweriana collectors show.    The suite showed some minor wear, nothing major, but it was clean, and the individual, Lizzette (sp?), was friendly and very helpful.",Positive,,,,,
"Our room, while very spacious and nice, was beset by a continuous noise which we could not figure out.
It sounded like some mechanical device and it kept us up most of our first night. I mentioned it to the desk clerk upon checkout but was only told that we should have reported it sooner.",Positive,,,,,
"Sharing the hotel with hordes of drunken fraternity partiers and junior high athletes definitely made for a less than relaxing experience last weekend. Staff tried, but yikes.",Negative,,,,,
"The rooms were very spacious and nice in that manner but quite outdated.  The hotel was extremely loud.  The food and drinks in the restaurant were good, but the service was horrendous!  The first night we were there I only ordered a captain and coke and it took 20 minutes to make it.  They were not busy they blamed it on not being able to find the cherries!  If that would have been communicated I would not have ordered that.  The next night our food order took over 45 minutes and then to get the bill it honestly took him an hour to bring that.  I had to ask for water 10 different occasions.  Again not really busy, but busier than Friday night.  The check out process was very long.  We were stuck in a line that the clerk was talking with a man for over 30 minutes.  She never redirected me to another line or asked someone else to help me.  I finally asked if it still would be a while and she confirmed that it would so I then moved to another line.",Positive,,,,,
Took at least 10 gal of water to get hot water to the shower.  Should have a free breakfast.,Positive,,,,,
There was a â€œpartyâ€ that went on nearly all night in the hotel.  When I called the desk I was told Security was doing everything they could.  If that was the case Security should have called the police for help.   I didnâ€™t get much sleep.  Disappointing as we stay at this hotel every year and have not had any similar problems.,Negative,,,,,
I loved that the no kids after 10 pm rule was enforced in the pool area. I really hate the parking lot fee and the process it takes to go in and out,Negative,,,,,
Very niceâ€”would just note that hotel could use further updating.,Positive,,,,,
Really enjoyed our stay!,Positive,,,,,
"The tranquility of our room was excellent, except there was a very noisy group outside our door around 5 a.m.  I should have called the desk to complain & if it happens again, I will.",Neutral,,,,,
Friday evening was very noisy until 2 a.m.  I love the suite rooms--they are super and provide an ideal space for me to do my quilting while my husband attends his convention.,Positive,,,,,
"We love the Hyatt in Green Bay. We were recently there in a Double Queen room which was great however the rooms are showing their age. For example, the bathroom had a hole in the ceiling near the light fixture, the trip was all dinged up, there were a few other cosmetic issues that you don't see in more modern hotels. The T.V.s were overall adequate however with the layout in bedrooms, that t.v. was a bit on the small side for the size of that room. 

Additionally the whirlpool was in very bad shape, didn't feel inviting to sit in or relaxing at all due the state of disrepair showing on the walls of the tub and immediate tile pieces. 

These are just little details that didn't disrupt our stay or cancel out the many positives that we saw while we were there, I just thought it should be brought to the attention of the staff as with these minor fixes, the Hyatt will truly be the best in Green Bay.",Positive,,,,,
"Second visit to this hotel, and both times front desk staff very polite, helpful, and great first experience when walking into hotel. Very impressed. Only reason for ""8"" on tranquility was the Fraternity/Sorority party that seemed to be very loud in the lobby around 3:00am",Positive,,,,,
Could use new bathtub and toilets  other than that it was awesome.,Positive,,,,,
More variety in pub menu choices,Positive,,,,,
"I feel for the cost of room and additional parking charge, you could offer a complimentary breakfast.",Positive,,,,,
"very nice. it was pretty loud from outside- sirens, etc but others a very pleasant stay",Positive,,,,,
"Matthew at the front desk was AWESOME!  The rest of the staff, not so much",Positive,,,,,
Nice amenities in the room such as the bottled water and Starbucks coffee.,Positive,,,,,
"The Price was very good, the rooms were very beautiful and clean. The bed and pillows were very comfortable.  We are looking forward in coming back for another stay at the Hyatt Regency!",Positive,,,,,
We enjoyed the stay at this hotel. Met our expectations and even exceeded it. Thank you.,Positive,,,,,
"The check-in time was awful - I am sure that wouldn't have happened if there were a bunch of adults coming in to stay with you.  We got our last 4 rooms at 9:15pm!  And one of the rooms the students couldn't stay in because it smelt so badly of smoke.  We told the front desk staff about it so we didn't get charged the fee for smoking.  We crammed our students together in one room so they didn't have to stay in the smoky room.  We didn't ask for a refund either because we felt it would be a hassle since the check-in was so horrible, who knows if we would actually get a refund.  It just wasn't worth it.  I hope that you have it together for this weekend's JAM conference and if it is a repeat, perhaps WASC can get out of the contract for next year.  With all that being said, the front desk staff was professional and were just doing their jobs and trying to please people who were yelling at them - they conducted themselves in a very fine manner considering the circumstances.",Positive,,,,,
"I was there for the WASC state conference. I was a lucky one with my rooms available at our scheduled time to check in.  My only issue was that my counter said to enjoy my two free bottles of water, and I had none. I called the desk later in the evening and asked if I could get at least one of my two bottles...I was not believed initially and then when I pushed a bit, I was told they would contact housekeeping. I never did get that water. Water is a perk...usually you pay a fee if you crack the bottle in your room...I thought it was a nice touch to have it...and I wouldn't have known if there wasn't a sign in the room to enjoy them. If you don't put out bottles, just throw the sign on the cart so it isn't such a lie.  Other schools had a very bad experience to check in, so to worry about advertised water is silly to bring up.  I will say from the bottom of my heart that  I was impressed by leadership at the hotel addressing the students in the morning at their keynote speaker.  To have adults in leadership rolls address students at a conference that was all about leadership couldn't have been better.  The leaders talking from the hotel showed and taught kids how to take responsibility, avoid throwing others under buses, avoid making excuses, avoid blame and finger pointed. Kids don't see adults in media doing that . It was good for them to see. Adults admitting it was wrong, that they were going to fix it and get to the bottom of it. That they were going to work to make it right and they weren't going to hide but be available to talk to.  Despite the events that led to the leaders addressing the students, it was a blessing in disguise. It was handled impressively and a perfect roll modeling for kids at a leadership conference. Well done.",Positive,,,,,
"The overall hotel is very nice. This stay did have its setbacks including the check in debacle experienced by many of the people staying there. The registration format was very cumbersome. I had difficulty with the online registration and then when I called to make my reservations, I was only allowed to reserve 3 rooms under one name. Needing to initially reserve 9 rooms this made it difficult. Our rooms ended up not being on the same floor, which when traveling with students, is a must. The reservation clerk also misspelled all the names on the reservations and this survey should be directed to Misty Draeger and not Barbara Reynolds as she was the primary contact. The rooms, however, are very nice and comfortable.",Positive,,,,,
Very nice hotel,Positive,,,,,
Our room faced the road and it was a little loud but that wasn't as concerning as the temperature in the room. We set it at 65 when we got there and we were gone until 1 am. When we got back it was 72.8 in the room and never cooled down all night.,Negative,,,,,
"Friendly staff, helpful specially with shuttle service. Great bar and loves the design of hotel.",Positive,,,,,
A bit dated and old bathrooms but enjoyable stay we were there for a wedding and loved the bar!,Positive,,,,,
The only concern is that the bathrooms were very small. There was only one small double hook for towels.,Positive,,,,,
"Although I LOVED what seemed like the business suite I was put in (rm 413) I didn't understand the placement of the TV. I was there for fun, not business and trying to watch TV from where it was located was really difficult. The cord connecting it to the wall (about 2ft long) made it impossible to move it at all as well. That was the only real frustrating part. (I came just to relax and watch movies for the weekend). Under the beds we're also not clean. You could tell where the vacuum stops and what isn't touced for a long time.",Positive,,,,,
"This is not necessarily a reflection on your staff but is worth mentioning.  We stayed over on Saturday, April  21st.  Everyone greeted us nicely and gave me good suggestions for dinner.  Upon returning from dinner, there was no room in the lot.  We were instructed to go to the ramp across the street, then take the skyway.  I was traveling with my daughter and never like parking in a ramp and walking a skyway at night.  I parked by the door to the skyway.  As soon as we got out of the car, we were approached by two men, somewhat aggressively asking for money and looking as if they were intoxicated.  I grabbed my daughter and we ran across the skyway no knowing if the door was locked on the other side because it looked all shut down for the night.  It was indeed open, but I don't like having to trouble shoot in my mind how we are to get out of this situation if we were cornered on the skyway and the door was not open.  A security call button would be helpful if you are asking female guests to park across the street and the ramp/stairwells are open to the public.  

As we were going back to our room, there was a group of girls (ages 8-12 approx) that were running around the atrium, looking unsupervised.  I didn't think much of it at the time.  However, at about midnight, I was awakened to these girls running and jumping above me.  This went on until about 3:30 a.m. when I called down to the front desk.  The desk person said security was looking for them.  Their parents just got back from the bar.  I'm not sure what you do about this, however, I feel like those parents could have covered the cost for my room for the night and a lesson in parenting.  

I apologize about the complaints.  Your staff was truly lovely.  These issues seem more for management to figure out.",Positive,,,,,
We loved the separate living room from the bedroom.  Great space.  Must have good soundproofing because we saw the little (loud) kids in the hallway leaving the room next door but never heard them while in our room.,Positive,,,,,
my key didn't work initially but that was taken care of quickly.,Positive,,,,,
Loved the pool and hot tub. Room was spacious and relaxing,Positive,,,,,
A decent place and a comfortable bed is #1 - you have that.  With that said - please is a bit dated.,Positive,,,,,
"Great stay.  Pool was a little cold, and our room cards didnt work after check-in, but after new cards they worked fine",Positive,,,,,
Ordered dinner in room 1 hour ahead but waited 20 min after delivery date. But was good,Positive,,,,,
"We were on a site visit for a possible convention stay. From the hotel building, staff, managers and food, I give them excellent marks. The sales manager was very helpful at all times. She gave and gave us attention and information. Everyone did so well that we are signing",Positive,,,,,
"In a previous stay, the bed where I slept seemed to have been done, but the pillows were not in place, as a Casual Observer would expect; it almost looked like these were messed up on purpose (i.e., not in place and like someone had been messing around with them).  During my last stay, I was going to use the small freezer in refrigerator, but there were some items stuffed in there and it looked like they had been there for a long while, as it was difficult to pull these out; I informed the front desk after and Housekeeping did pull the items out the following day.  It seems it may be a matter training and sharing expectations with Housekeeping on to follow a checklist with rigor and discipline.  I have stayed there a handful of times and every time I stay, there seems to be something different which should have been done much better, as a matter of following simple, daily procedures.  For now, the last thing I will mention is the oatmeal in the Starbucks place seems to be left there around the clock; I had a serving early in the morning and it was not very good at all; it was cold and clearly, it looked like it had been there for many hours.  I hope you truly take this feedback and do something about it, as I plan to stay there in the future; however, if I continue to have similar issues, I will look for other options to meet my needs.  Thanks.",Positive,,,,,
The check out process was exceedingly slow.  One lady was checking out of rooms for a school group and she kept checking out of rooms when more students showed up even though several people were standing in line behind her.  There was only one person working the desk on a Friday morning when many business travelers were checking out and he did not ask the woman to have her students remain in line like everyone else.  I was in line to check out for at least 15-20 minutes which caused me to be late for my next appointment.  Everything about this hotel was slow (even the elevators).  I would probably not stay here again.,Positive,,,,,
Staff is great but the room refurb program needs sped up. Awful HVAC system.  I'm looking to provide feedback to my company that we move elsewhere for now.,Positive,,,,,
Matthew at the front desk was great!,Positive,,,,,
"There are crumpled napkins under the sofa in room 224. The bar is nice, the bartenders seemed to spend more time chatting among themselves and not with the guests",Negative,,,,,
Very nice hotel with very nice staff.  Enjoyed my visit.,Positive,,,,,
"While having to stay an additional night due to weather, the staff members provided excellent care for all at the hotel.",Positive,,,,,
"We survived the Green Bay 2018 Blizzard at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.  A special Thank You to the front desk staff, bartenders, waitresses, omelet chef, cooks, and our cleaning lady!! They all did a remarkable job considering some staff couldn't make it in due to the storm and vendors weren't able to deliver which left them running low on some supplies and food. They did a great job staying patient, accommodating, friendly and professional while dealing with all of the dance families.  The only complaint I had was our room cleanliness.  When I first walked in, I immediately noticed this gray shading on top of the cloth head board which I knew was a build up of dust.  It was so bad, it was literally balling up so I took a cloth to wipe it for fear dust balls might fall on our faces and hair when we slept.  So much dust on shelf under the microwave and on carpet along the walls.  I know they have a lot a rooms to clean in a short amount of time, but an occasional vacuum  with a hose to run along the corner wouldn't hurt and definitely pay attention to the headboards...gross!   This is the only reason I didn't score a 10 for the rooms otherwise very satisfied with everything else the entire weekend :)",Positive,,,,,
"If there are quiet hours in the facility, then they need to be enforced and guests held accountable.  The noise level in the lobby carried on well into the night on Saturday, and until approximately 12:45 pm.  Given the layout of this location, the lobby noise can be heard in guest rooms at all levels with the open concept.  When stopping by the front desk around 10:00 pm to inquire about quiet hours we were told that a sign with the hours listed would be posted.  I called down at 11:30 pm to the front desk  with concern of the noise level, only to be told that 'I was just about to contact security as you called.'  
Again on Sunday night, after being told that quiet hours would be more effectively enforced by desk staff; noise levels in the lobby carried on until close to midnight.",Positive,,,,,
The staff were all friendly and very service oriented. I recommend the property and would stay there again with hesitation!,Positive,,,,,
"my only complaint is when I had to move to a different room at 1am due to someone smoking in another room, filling my room with nasty cigarette smoke.  The move went very smooth and security was nice enough about it.  Under the circumstances, I would have thought that I would have received a discount on my room so I was definitely disappointed.  I hope they were able to find the guy (I'm sure it was one of the guys that was on the bowling league, since I saw him earlier in the lobby with a cigarette)
Putting that aside, the staff was fantastic during the unfortunate weather we were all dealing with.  With food being limited and staff that couldn't make it in, those that were there did a fantastic job and should all be commended!",Neutral,,,,,
Restaurant food and drink was very expensive.,Positive,,,,,
We stayed at your hotel for a dance competition that turned into a major storm and the have to just say that the staff was beyond awesome! They treated all of us with great kindness and could not be any more helpful and professional! Best service ever in all areas!,Positive,,,,,
Excellent staff who went above and beyond during our stay during a snowstorm,Positive,,,,,
"We were stranded with 29 inches of snow. The employees that were able to make it in,worked long hours. I never saw them frustrated or short. Always professional and friendly. It was a wonderful experience.",Positive,,,,,
"Sun,, Apr15,'18, was a record snow fall day, which meant we had to stay an extra day (2 days total). Some staff could not come to work & some food supplies ran short. A brief letter to guests kept us informed. All in all, the hotel was very well run.",Positive,,,,,
The witers in the Pub we're very friendly and accommondating.  Excellent food while it was available due to blizzard with no deliveries.  Staff always helpful and friendly even with hardship with decrease in staff and services.  Still would stay again and recommend to everyone.,Positive,,,,,
"I would like to thorough thank the staff this weekend.  With terrible weather conditions, the staff handled the situation extremely well.  Well done",Positive,,,,,
"We were very impressed with the staff and services offered during the worst snow storm in 129 years.  The staff, even though many were working short handed and were staying at the hotel on account of the weather, were kind, caring and went above and beyond to make our stay pleasant.  The only concern was a leak in the bathroom above the tub and shower as a result of a plumbing problem in the upstairs unit.  The front desk was informed immediately, but I imagine being short handed were not able to correct the problem during our 3 night stay.  Unfortunately the upstairs neighbor kept different hours then my family and the 2:15 am shower left a raining sound in our bathroom that made a restful night sleep challenging.  Other than that blemish, it was a flawless stay in otherwise terrible conditions outside.  We will be looking to stay in the future.",Negative,,,,,
"The staff was amazing!  It was a crazy weekend with the weather and the staff handled it all very well!  From helping shovel peopleâ€™s cars out to serving more people than expected in restaurant and bar, they just were amazing!  Thank you!  It was a great place to be snowed in at!",Positive,,,,,
It was a longer stay than expected due to weather but you really had everything we needed and more,Neutral,,,,,
"This was probably the best stay at a hotel that I have had in a really long time, quite possibly ever! We were stranded there due to the snow and every single staff person worked day and night to make sure we had a good experience-even when they werenâ€™t able to go home because of the weather.

We brought our dog with us, and the staff even remembered her name throughout the weekend. She is diabetic and unable to eat regular dog food. The kitchen staff cooked her some food so we would have enough to get through our extra time there. 

I have Celiac disease and the kitchen/wait staff were so on top of things- making sure everything was gluten free. Even when it was insanely busy after the competition each night and the food choices were limited, they found something for me to eat! I didnâ€™t get sick all weekend! 

The housekeeping staff did a great job taking care of our room, and I will apologize again for my daughter making such a huge mess with the glitter. :) 

The woman in the Market knew my chai order by the second day, and was so kind! 

I have nothing but good things to say about this place and the people who work there. They all deserve a blizzard bonus! If I am ever in Green Bay again, this is exactly where we will be staying!",Positive,,,,,
Your staff did amazing through snow storm Evelyn!  Congrats to your staff for doing everything possible to make everyone's stay great even under the circumstances.,Positive,,,,,
"There was a horrible snow storm the night we stayed but all of the staff was amazing. They ensured we were parked in the ramp so we wouldn't be stuck the next morning and they were very supportive and attentive even though I'm sure it was chaotic for them.  Amazing food, pool area, rooms were great - very happy with our experience.  The person who checked me in and out was fantastic.  Didn't catch his name but he remembered who I was and made sure I had what I needed.",Positive,,,,,
The staff at the Hyatt went above and beyond the weekend of the blizzard 2018 cheer family from Diamond School of Dance from Eau Claire Wisconsin. We were snowed in for the weekend and they were amazing their staff in the restaurant for breakfast in the little Pub. They were all amazing they did exceptional. Thank you so much for taking care of us. We hope that our venue and dance competition will be at this hotel next year because we definitely will be back.,Positive,,,,,
Got woken up by girls laugh and talking by my door. Was not happy about it.,Positive,,,,,
We stayed for 5 nights and it was so hot in our room we had to open the door. The staff gave us a fan. For the money we spent you should have air conditioning. It was very uncomfortable.,Negative,,,,,
Check in very slow. At 11:00pm when we went to bed found dirty sock in one of the beds.  Too late to call housekeeping one person ended up sleeping on couch. Bill was 125.90 charged 150.90 will dispute with credit card company.,Negative,,,,,
The  stafe wint above and beyond  during our stay their. was a Major snow storm in April none the lease the city of green bay was caught off grad but your staff was not  they sent thair own staff out side to dig our cars out  of the parking lot  and letting us know the up to date road conditions  letting us stay as long as we need to making us fell safe and at home the hole time  Iv been bragging about how wonderful everyone was I will be back for shire,Positive,,,,,
bathroom is small and the toilets are way to small for adults.,Neutral,,,,,
Very friendly staff.  We appreciated the upgraded room and bottle of wine.,Positive,,,,,
"We had a problem with our bed. It had a broken box spring for 2 nights. We were compensated 2 nights of our 6 night got stay.
Housekeeping did not come at convenient times.",Negative,,,,,
"There was a razor cartridge in bathroom waste basket from previous guest and the coffee maker in room was missing a rubber 'foot' which seemed to make coffee miss cup and spill on counter.  Neither was a huge deal but they did lower my scores.  Food is okay, but options seem to have narrowed over the years.",Negative,,,,,
The final night of my stay - aligned with a sporting event. The room next to me must have been a part room.  I spoke to the two security guards and the staff - no one made any attempt to quite the room. It was noisy until after 11 45.  I assume that my concerns were not important because of the numerous rooms involved with the sports event.  Even on check out - the staff just said that I would be receiving a survey.  I would appreciate a response from someone.,Positive,,,,,
The young lady who checked me in was super welcoming. I left my drivers license at home and my admin called to ensure that I could still check in because I was not from town. When I checked in the front desk was all over ensuring that I was good to go. After a log day of meetings I appreciated the experience.,Positive,,,,,
"It is absolutely absurd to have in a contract for an elimination tournament like the USA Hockey Nationals to have in the contract that 24 hour notice must be given before checking out early.  What if the team was eliminated at 10pm?  Would one have to immediately run back to the hotel to tell you that they have been eliminated?  They could not leave without being charged for the next night?  This is ridiculous especially when it takes 30 seconds to cancel the next night's reservation and be done with it.  This happened to me, and the front desk staff had a horrible attitude about changing my check out date.  It is bad enough that we are REQUIRED to stay at the hotel, then we are defined by the length of our stay.  I would much rather have stayed at the Hampton next door where you are not lectured about some idiocy related to the ""contract"", which by the way, I never got to read or had a copy of.",Negative,,,,,
very nice room and excellent breakfast buffet,Positive,,,,,
A fine experience.,Positive,,,,,
"Great rooms, large with great amenities.",Positive,,,,,
"Stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Green Bay WI. Check in progress was horrible Amanda Mostek at the front desk was very rude. Also during the night I had to  call down to the front desk 3 times, due to the fact that the people under us were very loud. I had a child that was needing to get up the next day very early. she didn't get any sleep, she kept saying she was very scared. The lady at the front desk her name was Amanda Mostek was not polite when checking out. She asked how our stay was and I said horrible. she only apologized one time and said she could take 50.00 off the bill. Due to the fact that ""we didn't pay for our stay"" her exact words she said to me. We didn't pay for our stay that's true. my mother inlaw paid for it as a gift to my husband and I, it was our anniversary gift. Then Monday I pulled up my account and they charged me for the stay and they were not suppose to. I called my mother in law and they also charged her card for a one night stay as well. so they charged both of us. so I would not ever recommend anyone to stay at the Hyatt. worse experience ever.",Positive,,,,,
The bed mattress was tired.  Housekeeping did not come service room when asked.,Negative,,,,,
Getting the room cleaned up took a bit.  I had the sign on to clean but someone turned it around so I'm not sure if that was an issue.,Positive,,,,,
"Actually stayed 3 days. Thursday check in was OK. Agent was pleasant. Friday room service took used bath towels but did not leave clean ones, even though I left a $5 tip. Had to use a face towel for bathing. No Saturday room service whatsoever. Coffee packs were not replaced. Had to call desk for towels. Quiet hours are posted as 9 PM to 7 AM but that was not the case. Lots of noise in the pool and just outside the bar, which resonated throughout. Very noisy in our room Friday night and past 11 PM Saturday. The place seems poorly managed.",Positive,,,,,
loved the breakfast except the eggs. im not a fan of powdered.,Positive,,,,,
We stayed the weekend for my fatherâ€™s birthday as we have for the last 25 years at this very hotel. Unfortunately the past years were much better than this last year based on the fact that we had to pay an extra $12.50 for breakfast and with my father checked and he was told I had a room next to him when I stopped in three hours prior to make sure no one would tell him to be supposed to be a surprise.,Positive,,,,,
"My reservations ( I made 3) confirmations did not match what the hotel computer had, and when I called to verify everything the person I talked to (Amanda) was rather ""Harsh"", I did not care for her attitude at all.  When we arrived the girl behind the desk ""Heather"" was more than accommodating, the window on our car broke on the way up and she went out of her way to get us a few supplies to patch it up!  She was also the person who helped us out upon check-out, she was very friendly and accommodating.  I stay at Hyatt all the time, this was not the best experience for us....",Positive,,,,,
Toilet was not cleaned under the seat and on the exterior of the bowl running down to the floor. Only 1 bar of soap was provided in bathroom.,Negative,,,,,
"Next time there is a guest who is slamming doors after midnight, having his children run wild in the hall after midnight, is yelling and cursing outside his room after midnight, and finally is escorted from the hotel in the middle of the night... DONT WAIT SO LONG!",Negative,,,,,
Room were dated with furniture being old and weathered. Between queen beds was very dusty and dirty. We had to use housekeeping vacuum to clean it.,Neutral,,,,,
The cafe staff did not listen to me when I told them my drink order was wrong. After explaining myself two times I realized that she was not going to make my drink correctly I requested a side of vanilla syrup so that I could fix the wrong drink myself.,Positive,,,,,
No plug points bedside to charge a phone. The house keeping service is extremely bad. For a brand like Hyatt it is too bad that the beds were not even properly done or the refrigerated cleared after the previous guest left.,Positive,,,,,
"Only reason I gave the check-in process a 7 instead of a higher score was that their computer systems were not working well due to a power blip, but that wasn't really their fault.",Positive,,,,,
"I was surprised that parking was $5 per car, I had 2 cars. I am a guest and should NOT have to pay to park my car during my stay. The bed was squeaky and the thermostat in the room did not work well. I would not stay here again.  I would stay at another hotel that doesnâ€™t make their customers pay to park.",Positive,,,,,
"Rooms looked a little dates.  There was a piece of door missing on the bathroom door on mine at the bottom, which was room 516.  However, that did not distract from the stay at all.  Nice room.  People were very friendly in all of the departments.",Neutral,,,,,
there was a $5 parking fee when you are a guest staying in the hotel. Whats that all about?,Negative,,,,,
"We had such a wonderful experience.  Everyone was so extremely polite from every aspect.  1) Security guard informed us about not being able to have glass in the pool and even brought us a cup to replace the glass, so very kind and respectful.  2) The waitstaff at breakfast always made sure we were taken care of and very friendly and responsive.  3) I wasn't aware that the included breakfast was just the buffet they just said breakfast was included and we would get a receipt and to bill it to the room, they reimbursed us being that I wasn't aware.  Again seemed like everyone went out of their wait to make us happy with our stay.  Only reason I moved tranquility of room down from a 10 is it's hard to have a tranquil room in a corporate suite which makes and office type atmosphere, other than that if the office part would have been walled off with half wall or something would have felt more tranquil.",Positive,,,,,
"The king suite room was a bit dated for the price point, and the pool water was very cold. The food at the buffet was cold at times as well and there wasnâ€™t always a person at the omelet station. But the service was wonderful and we were comfortable.",Positive,,,,,
"Upon check in, we were given a room that had not been serviced by housekeeping. We were not upset by any means but it was definitely not the best first impression. Other than that we were very comfortable and will be back in the future.",Positive,,,,,
"I chose the Hyatt regency because of its great online reviews and low rates, even during a holiday weekend. I was very surprised how nice the hotel was compared to other hotels I've stayed at with similar rates. I especially liked our room amenities including 2 separate living spaces, the refrigerator, and bar area. I would have liked more food options in the market with lower prices.",Positive,,,,,
"Very nice rooms. Bedroom and sitting room with a couch, TV, microwave and frig.",Positive,,,,,
We always stay at the Hyatt when we visit our daughter in Green Bay-unless we have our dog with us.  She's just a 10 pound terrier but not welcome in some hotels.,Positive,,,,,
Housekeeping is terrible,Negative,,,,,
"Yet another fantastic stay at the Hyatt! This was our third trip down and second with the kids. I had originally booked a double queen by mistake and I emailed them a week ahead of our stay to see about switching. Not only did they upgrade is to a king suite, but they also sent us pictures of what the room looked like. When we arrived they said we were getting free parking as well!
The room was fantastic and the kids loved having the living room to themselves. 
The first night we did run into some minor issues, but when we informed them the next morning everything was sorted right away.
Later that night the manager took the time to call us to see if all the issues were resolved. They also asked us if we would like them to bring an easter basket up for the kids :-)
That night we requested a fan for our room, and unfortunately when we plugged it in we popped a breaker, we called and they fixed it right away. Before bed we tried it in a different outlet and it happened again! Since it was already late we waited until morning to mention it to the front desk. They brought us a new fan and fixed it again. This time it didn't pop the breaker :-)
We went down to Milwaukee that day and the manager emailed me to apologize for the breaker issues. He said he emailed because he had remembered that we would be at the hockey game, so it is cool that he remembered the conversation that he had with my wife the night before.
For us we NEVER expect a stay at any hotel to be perfect. What makes a great hotel is what they do when an issue does occur. The Hyatt staff has always been quick to fix things for us. They also go out of their way to make sure we leave as happy customers! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! !!",Positive,,,,,
The room next to us the children they had were very loud and annoying. Kept being loud enough to hear through the walls.,Negative,,,,,
Rooms could use updates. Doors damaged. Toilet wobbly.,Negative,,,,,
Matthew was extremely nice at check-in.,Positive,,,,,
"Only a couple of real complaints. First off the check in process over the phone is horrendous. You go from robot to person back to robot. The bot apparently couldnâ€™t understand so it took almost 15 minutes just to make a reservation. 
Also, we stayed on the second floor near the lobby and the music they play in the morning was loud enough to keep me awake.",Negative,,,,,
"The hotel was not full at all. We had reserved a one-bedroom executive suite. Again, with the hotel not being full and having the most expensive room in the hotel, there was still a family put on the adjoining room next to us! I like my hotel stays quiet and this situation was not quiet due to the adjoining room situation. Not sure why the front desk associate assigned rooms this way. There were rooms occupied on all levels of the hotel.",Positive,,,,,
The room was very dusty & hot. Heating/Cooling system did not seem to be working properly. I requested a fan which never made it to my room.,Positive,,,,,
"What a wonderful stay we had! All do to your amazing-caring staff! All your people had a ""can do attitude""!
We live in the city & just may come monthly, to enjoy the benefits of staying at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay! Well done folks!",Positive,,,,,
Was there for a week but housekeeping only cleaned room three times.,Neutral,,,,,
"I had a problem with a man on my floor with his door constantly open and watching people including me going in and out of our rooms.  Even though I was part of a group package, when I reported this I was given a choice to move my room to another room that was not part of my groupâ€™s package.",Positive,,,,,
We had trouble getting wifi for our tablets. We did not seek out help.,Negative,,,,,
Your staff was great! We really appreciated the over the top customer service from the check in with Ally and how fast she addressed our issues (Friday and Saturday my room was not cleaned when we returned at 3 pm) to the staff helping with the room set-up and Audio Visual. The mints was a great touch in our rooms. My Hyatt profile states Feather free room and I discovered on Friday that the pillows were feather. I travel to Green Bay a lot for Business and had never stated here althou our Green Bay office is next door. I will definitely be staying here again when traveling.,Positive,,,,,
I enjoyed my stay and will certainly consider looking for a Hyatt to stay at for any other traveling I do.,Positive,,,,,
"Room 728 was a disaster, 5 unacceptable items were discussed with Manager Ally & she was genuinely appalled & promised to address the concerns. Ally is excellent to work with!! We did enjoy the hot tub & the dry sauna & overall common areas of this property were clean & nice atmosphere. Undecided about whether or not we will choose to stay here for our trip to Green Bay in April.",Positive,,,,,
"Frannie Bedat-Fitzpatrick and the entire Hyatt/KI Convention Center staff did an amazing job in meeting the needs of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. As the chair of the event, I wanted the member of our organization and community to have a great experience and they did. Staff wore our colors in support of the event and provided candy treats in the guest rooms. They were phenomenal. We will definitely use them again.",Positive,,,,,
"The only issues I had were that my first night of my stay, the heat did not work in my room. I told Heather at the front desk & when I returned to my room, it was much better.",Positive,,,,,
"Bathroom Facilities, toilet in particular, appeared to be grade school standard in terms of height.  Slightly uncomfortable for adults, of any height, use.",Negative,,,,,
"My only negative comment is that I wish there were outlets near the bed, but the staff was absolutely AMAZING!!",Positive,,,,,
"Could have patrolled the parking lot better, lots of people parking there who was not a guest, I had to park across the street, I was a little scared walking to my room at 3am after work, also, my room service I ordered was horrible, I left a note on my plate, I ordered the skillet.  The whites of the eggs werenâ€™t cooked, and potatoes were soggy, the water glass I had was full of greasy fingerprints and lipstick, all I ate was the bacon and toast, my bill was $22 I left a note saying not to charge this to my room because it was disgusting, especially the glass, needless to say it was on my hotel bill when I checked out, not happy",Negative,,,,,
"Very good experience, nice staff and wonderful banquet facility",Positive,,,,,
"The refrigerator in our room as very loud and ran all night.  Also, thermostat did not seem to be working correctly in the room.  On a brighter note... Scott in the bar was awesome!",Positive,,,,,
"Great service - the staff was professional, welcoming & efficient.  They made our event run smoothly.",Positive,,,,,
"Later in the evening, there were noisy people one floor about, yelling from the balcony into the main area. They were banging in their room and making a lot of noise for several hours. There were silent/ quiet hours and they obviously did not respect this nor did anyone from the hotel work staff address the issue.  I am certain others staying heard this as well, they were very loud.  I could not get decent sleep.",Positive,,,,,
The restaurant personnel satisfactorily rectified a situation of cold food promptly and also discounted our bill. We are very pleased with that response.,Positive,,,,,
"I had no hot water 3 out of the 4 days I was there, The room was too hot and I was told that they do not turn on the ability to use the air conditioner until spring, so I would just have to open a door.",Positive,,,,,
Toilet is too low.,Negative,,,,,
"Better lighting is needed in the ""living"" area. None of the lamps offer enough light for reading.",Positive,,,,,

We had a great time.  Very thankful to Tracy who had our room upgraded at no extra charge.  All of the staff were polite and helpful.  Overall we enjoyed our stay very much.,Positive,,,,,
Overall is good.,Positive,,,,,
"The check-in process was great. Matthew at the front desk was amazing!! The room could be a little loud with the air system and the hall noise. I stay in A LOT of hotels and I was shocked to not have a full length mirror, not a huge deal.  But overall good. Thank you.",Positive,,,,,
Love size and space of room but bathroom needs more space.,Positive,,,,,
"Nice place, nice area!",Positive,,,,,
"Room was not attended to/cleaned. Not a big deal as I was a single traveler however, I was unable to control the heat & wrote a note for it to be attended to (with a tip.) Elevator was SLOW. I tried the stairs but they were a bit scary & not helpful when I could not get out on the first floor.",Neutral,,,,,
The elevators were EXTREMELY slow and often was out of order and we were only there two nights.,Negative,,,,,
"My first night say was in room 201 with the adjoining door to another room.  I had two situations. First, room 234 was having a party with many guests.  It was loud.  The front desk manager did send security up around 10: 30pm and the noise was reduced.  Secondly, sharing a door with the room next door, I don't remember the room #, was as though you were sitting in the room with the other people.  These folks (although they have a perfect right to laugh, talk, do whatever they do . . .) were up til way past 1am in the morning.  Here are my thoughts, the room was clean and well presented, the acoustics being an adjoined room were not conducive for people who did not know each other and had very different needs.  I needed to be able to sleep and be up early the next morning, and the other people seemed to be in the ""partying"" mode.  I did change rooms the next day to the 8th floor and it made a world of difference.  I do appreciate the great customer service and my requests were taken into consideration.",Positive,,,,,
Just a couple of comments:  The elevator is very slow and I believe that one or two  of the elevators were not operational during some of the weekend.  The pool area gets very slippery and on Saturday evening the towels in the pool area were not replenished and  available.,Positive,,,,,
"Restaurant was busy.  Called to order since service at bar was not possible.  Routed to front desk as no answer.  I was told a return call would be made to take order.  No call back, had to go off premises for dinner.  Front desk personnel were great.",Positive,,,,,
"Rooms are big and have a great layout, very clean.  Our room faced Main St. so it was a little loud, but didn't notice it when sleeping.  Elevators are VERY slow.  Beverage prices at our event were very high.",Positive,,,,,
I was emailed an option to upgrade and i chose to pay for an upgrade and it was not acknolwedged at check in. I was fairly disappointed by that.,Negative,,,,,
Overall great experience!,Positive,,,,,
"I had a reservation for 3/9 and due to a medical emergency in my family I had to come a day early. I called and booked 3/8. The girl was helpful and nice. I also asked for extra towels in the room. When I checked in I found out rather than having 1 reservation for 2 night I had 2 reservations for 1 night. I asked that they be combined cause I didn't want to switch rooms! The girl seemed confused and had to ask someone else for help. She than asked me if I wanted a ""quiet"" room which seemed strange. She didn't seem to know what room to put me in.
The room was nice. The curtains however were falling off in the upper left corner for the outside windows. There was a good amount of dust in several places of the room. The lights in the bedroom had to be manually turned on. 
I did call down for a curling iron and one was promptly delivered to my door. I placed an order on the door for breakfast and it arrived on time delivered by two delightfully cheerful young ladies which was a nice start to my day. The food was uneventful nd a bit cold but I was hungry. When I left my room at 10:30 am I placed the service sign on my door and Than went to the convention center. I noticed that seemed to also be served in the lobby yet no one at check in mentioned this to me and no where in the room did I see notifications that it was. That was disappointing.
I returned to my room about 5:30 pm only to find that it was not made up. I called down to the desk and again spoke to a not so helpful desk clerk. I explained that my room was not made up. She questioned me and I assured her it had not been touched since the breakfast tray was still in the room. I asked if they could please remove the tray, bring me a couple of wash clothes and 2 bottles of water. She informed me that water is only given n the first night and I would have to pay for water. I said no thank you and let her know that I was going back out. When I returned at 9:45 pm the room had been somewhat done. Bathroom cleaned they did leave 2 bottles of water. When I was going to check out in the morning again I noticed breakfast in the lobby. I had called down to the desk to make sure I was not charged for the water as after being told I would be charged for it I purchased water elsewhere. I also inquired as to where I should leave the curling iron. The girl at the desk was very helpful and nice.",Positive,,,,,
"I will list the problems herein but prior to doing so will state that the percentage discount mitigated some of the frustration, irritation and anger felt and expressed due to three problems encountered on the 9th of March due to apparently full occupancy.

1).  Upon arriving there were no luggage carts available and none appeared for the half hour that we sought one until we gave up and made three trips from car to room.  It seems that this could be alleviated in two ways: a)put signs on the carts asking guests to unload all luggage upon entering the room and then immediately put them outside the room if they will not be going to the lobby so that other guests can retrieve them; and (b) since luggage carts take up a lot of room provide cargo dollies with drop down lips as back ups when all carts are in use (five of these nested would take up the space of one cart in the storage room).

2). We went to a theater play that evening and returned to the lot at 9:45PM.  Upon entering we found a full lot and circled for ten minutes until there were three others doing the same.  One of us had to go into the lobby to find out what we were to do and were given vague directions as to where to go off site but no map was provided nor any info about where to park to use the walkway and how to get back into the hotel which took another fifteen minutes.  Also, the Hyatt should invest in one of those systems that says â€œlot is fullâ€ when there are no open spaces.

3). Upon entering the lobby through the back entrance we decided to check the hot tub and pool area at 10:15pm to determine if there was a crowd.  Surprisingly we counted almost a dozen children in the area ranging from about 5 to 15.  A complaint was made to the desk where the gentleman with the radio said he would go there to inform them of the time.  I then went to my room to change and waited until about 11PM to return to find 10 minors in the area with four of them in the hot tub...... No adult male with any common sense is going to put himself into that situation especially when there are three morbidly obese loud  â€œmomsâ€ there with 16oz plastic cups in hand supposedly parenting instead of being in rooms and having their kids in bed. Perhaps parents need a tactful list of reminders about how families should behave in a decent hotel including not yelling up into or across the atrium to others.  I would also suggest a large sandwich board be placed just inside the pool door at 9:30PM reminding all about the 10PM curfew since many ignore the door signage.   Additional personnel would be beneficial when there is high occupancy since the one man with radio seemed to be juggling a lot.... At 11:05 I again located the gentleman with the radio who responded that he had just checked the area.  I told him of my disgust with the situation and that I was returning to my room.  At about 11:20 we got a phone call from the man who apologized and told us that he would authorize the room discount.  That was a good response because we were discussing among ourselves that perhaps we should give up on the Hyatt for future GB stays due to the perception that families with children might be the preferred demographic for the Hyatt now. â€”-End narrative",Negative,,,,,
"I unfortunately did not have a good experience.  My room reservation was wrong and left me without enough room for all my guests.  The hotel would not do anything for me, except offer me the option to cancel my entire reservation.  We were here for a Company event in the KI Center so I had booked the 4 rooms for me and my guests being the convenience factor.  Finally, after getting our Event Coordinator, the room was finally mysteriously available.  Odd how it was available 5 minutes later.

Then I called the morning of to ask if I could check in early.  The lady on the other end of the line told me I needed to call the local number, which is what I had done.  When I asked to be connected she said she couldnâ€™t do that.  Huh?  With todayâ€™s technology, I canâ€™t be connected?

At check-in, my reservation was still incorrect and I had to wait for the lady to make the necessary changes.

Our room was just ok.  Had to wait 30 minutes for a hair dryer cause there wasnâ€™t one in the room.  The refrigerator is only a cooler- not a refrigerator.  

The breakfast was shut down before 11:00 check out which was very disappointing.  The 333 pizza was horrible.  The drinks are overpriced and staff was rude.

Then to top it off, my boyfriend and I (2 cars) were charged $45.00 to park in the parking lot, which was assesssed as we were leaving the lot.  This is insane!  I paid to stay and have to pay to park?  This should be disclosed.  

The was by far the worst hotel experience I have had in years. The employees were not helpful or pleasant.  I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.",Negative,,,,,
Thank you I always enjoy my stay,Positive,,,,,
"I pre-checked in on line.  E-mail said room 818.  The lady at check in said 816 on my envelope.  I questioned her and she said 816.  I said then why was I told 818?  She looked again and said I was in room 818.  I asked her are you sure our keys are right.  Yes they are.  Well guess what???  The keys didn't work for 818 but they did work for 816 which was an occupied room!!!!  NOT GOOD!  I had to go all way back down and get it straighten out.  The lady who gave me my key wasn't there and the one who was there when I got the keys didn't seem to care.  It was like no big deal.  Upon check out I asked the lady if she heard what happened.  She said oh you must of talked to Matthew (I think that was his name).  I said no, I never talked to Matthew.  She also didn't care.  Very sad and no apologizes either.  Great room, view and lovely hotel but not impressed with the check in and no one seemed to care.  Thank you!  Helena Jacyno",Positive,,,,,
"I scheduled a wake up call for my first morning at 545am, I didn't get any call.  I was told from the front desk they would look into this.  I drank both bottles of water on the first day and never got any more (I was there for 4 days).  There was dust under the sink in the bathroom the whole week.  I also would drink both packages of coffee in the morning, problem was the housekeeper would only refill by leaving one package for me.  The gym was great as well as one waiter.  He worked in the restaurant at night and then at the breakfast in the morning.  Friendly and remembered me by name.  That was a nice touch",Positive,,,,,
"I ordered a Caesar chicken wrap,  I got the other type of chicken wrap...it was spicy.  And they forgot the glass of water I ordered but the room had water so that was ok.",Neutral,,,,,

Check in was disastrous period,Negative,,,,,
"for the price I paid, think I should have been given at least coffee downstairs and a light breakfast",Positive,,,,,
Very pleasant.,Positive,,,,,
"Upon entry, the room smelled strongly of men's cologne which immediately felt like the room had not been cleaned. The bed was very uncomfortable and squeaky. There wasn't a floor length mirror and the damaged ironing-board cover made it impossible to iron clothes, just made them more wrinkled. Overall, the rooms need a make over. They also need a better restaurant. I will not stay here again, especially when there's a brand new hotel nearby that my co-workers raved about. I should have checked the reviews before staying here instead of assuming a Hyatt would be nice.",Positive,,,,,
"The only issue here was parking.  The lot at the front of the property is small, there is an overflow parking ramp that is owned,  assume by the municipality.  On weekends it is free, but during the week there is an  additional charge for parking in the ramp.",Positive,,,,,
The water was only warm when we went to take a shower in the morning.,Positive,,,,,
Please don't refer to your breakfast tickets as complimentary and then charge after the breakfast is eaten.  The tickets you use are miss leading.  My room was a bit dirty on arrival.  Something brown and disgusting on the counter near the kitchenette.,Positive,,,,,
I received an email prior to my stay offering an upgrade to a king for $5 per night. I accepted. I did not have a king when I checked in. I was not changed extra. Also we had no maid service after our first night?  I asked for clean towels which we received.,Positive,,,,,
My room was 73 degrees when i entered.  Despite turning the thermostat down the room would not cool.  It was very difficult to sleep as a result.,Positive,,,,,
"We were on the 2nd floor and could hear noise from the lobby occasionally.  We had a problem with a marijuana odor in our room one morning around 3 am.  We called front desk and asked them to check into it.  It wasn't really clear if they ever did.  We came back to our room around 7pm Sunday evening and our room had not been ""refreshed"".  We were tired, had a toddler, and wanted to relax in a clean room.  When I called the front desk to inquire why our room had not been cleaned I was told a lot of guests had checked out that day and the housekeeping staff were still cleaning rooms.  When housekeeping brought us clean towels & glasses about a 1/2 hour later we asked her if rooms were still being cleaned.  She said no they finished with all the rooms at 5:30pm.  I did not appreciate the front desk giving us wrong information!  I then talked to a manager and she told me that a lot of guests had checked out that day and she wasn't sure why our room was overlooked.  I told her the rooms that had guests returning should have been cleaned first.  I was offered a free breakfast as compensation!  I did not want a free breakfast and asked to have the room charge for that night taken off my bill.  I should have been told right away that they were truly sorry for the inconvenience and I would not be charged for that night instead of having to ask!  I was very disappointed with these experiences.  This is not the quality of service I expect from Hyatt.  Will probably not return to this hotel when visiting Green Bay in the future.",Positive,,,,,
"Overall, our two night stay was quite satisfactory however the unavailability of luggage carts for check out was off-putting.  However, one employee, Matthew Hastreiter, who was handling our check out was exemplary.  When he noticed my consternation at the absence of luggage carts he volunteered to personally come up to our room to help bring the luggage into the lobby to assist in our departure.  I did not take him up on the offer but for him to recognize the fact that the all (I believe he said there were seven of them...I could be mistaken about that) the carts were not available was attentive and provided us with an extremely positive impression of the front desk staff.",Positive,,,,,
"The hotel was very nice, clean, and roomy. We highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting the Green Bay area.",Positive,,,,,
Quietest hotel I've ever experienced! We love the bar/couch area in the front of the room as well.,Positive,,,,,
The front desk was AWSOME one young lady in particular who checked me in she was so understanding and helpful!! Every staff member I had the pleasure of meeting were friendly and helpful from the shuttle driver wait staff to the housekeeping crew we had an amazing stay!!!,Positive,,,,,
"A long wait to check in, when my turn came the girl couldnâ€™t get signed in, went to a different computer, I finally had to wait foe a different person to check me in.  I was not very happy.",Positive,,,,,
"Overall the stay was great. Check in line was long and took a bit to get through.

My room was a amazing, except I couldnâ€™t find a blow dryer or a full length mirror.",Positive,,,,,
"We had ripped sheets, pizza rolls in our microwave and egg yolks hardened on our countertops. We also were cold the entire of our stay yet the thermostat was set to 74 degrees.",Negative,,,,,
"We had a great rate because of a wedding block - but the room was stifling hot (we finally realized the patio door opened and that we could have requested a fan.)  Also - I know it would be a hugh update but the bathrooms really need fans for humidity and other things.  If there was a venting system it was not adequate.   A little miffed that we could not park in the hotel lot, but the parking ramp off main was okay. Beds were comfy.  Our bedroom TV Seemed a bit offf - but as it was after midnight we did not call, just wanted to check scores.  Did so in the morning in living area. (Sorry, forgot to report it when I checked out).  Loved that he asked for floor prefernece at check-in and the water was extemely appreciated.",Positive,,,,,
Very clean and well appointed hotel.  Our only complaint was the elevators.  They are horrible slow and inefficient.,Negative,,,,,
"Utilized your hotel due to attending a wedding. On the day of the wedding we were in the
room until 2 or 2:30 pm and DID NOT experience any housekeeping (no bed making, restocking, cleaning, etc). We returned at 9 pm. We did not ask for housekeeping but they were at the
room adjacent to ours when we left.??",Positive,,,,,
"I don't think guests should have to pay for parking. The price of the stay is enough, it should include parking. Also the heat unit was loud in the room, woke me up during the night every time it came on.",Negative,,,,,
Iron in room inoperable. Cover on ironing board dirty.,Negative,,,,,
"Upon check-in my keys didnâ€™t work, for 45 minutes they kept sending me up with new keys until I requested to have a maintenance person come look at the door. They told me I had to call security myself if I wanted someone to come up to the room with me. Finally they had a change in heart and as it turns out the key reader was broken. He replaced it quickly and it worked the rest of the weekend. 

The cleanliness of the room was okay. The vent in the shower kept blowing lint on us during our showers and we had two yellow stains on our bed spread. 

We called down to the front desk on Thursday evening and requested new bed spreads, a toothbrush and floss. After 2.5 hours and an additional call, we got the toothbrush and floss. The gentleman that I spoke with the second time apologized and said here had been a shift change.

Overall the hotel and the experience were nice, the location is great; just had a couple horrid moments that tainted things slightly.",Positive,,,,,
"Staff was great 
 The hotel is beautiful  but the room was not  as clean as I would've  expected.   Behind the curtains in the doors has never been cleaned in the bathrooms in the corners also . The  sheets on the one bed looked like they had urine stains on them .",Positive,,,,,
"Ordered room service, it was awful and made me sick.",Negative,,,,,
Iâ€™m a frequent guest at your Green Bay hotel. The food is usually satisfactory never great. But my last two stays which included several meals was less then satisfactory. Samon was over cooked and the rice was not eatable. I tried a hamburger the next night and the quality of the meat was way below average. Gordonâ€™s foods frozen hamburgers are better. If the quality of food doesn't improve I will be looking for an alternative hotel in the GB area.,Positive,,,,,
"This hotel needs a serious refresh especially to its rooms.  A quick change would be to lighten wall colors, get rid of mildew smell, paint the door panels and frame which are in horrible condition and change out hardware.  Better towels would be nice too, they are thin and scratchy.  just doesn't feel like a Hyatt when you're in the room.",Positive,,,,,
The only set back was the noise level from hearing the restaurant/bar from the bottom floor at my room level. I just moved my self to the back bedroom and closed the door. But I would thing not everyone would do this for a stay. Otherwise it was a great stay!,Positive,,,,,
"The room reservation was a little confusing, but everything else was very smooth.",Positive,,,,,
"Always at a high Level
Thanks Hyatt",Positive,,,,,
"I had difficulty with the keylocks  Sometimes they did not work even after several swipes, and then all of a sudden they would work...even though I had done nothing differently.

Also...a delicate subject...but have you thought in your next remodel to try elongated toilet fixtures in the rooms.  The poircilen bowls are a bit small to allow the necessary procedures while using the device.",Positive,,,,,
Had a great stay. The elevators are a little slow.,Positive,,,,,
"I always enjoy my stay at the Hyatt and the WAA conference. I look forward too it every year. We often spend hundreds of dollars eating and drinking with distant friends at the bar in the hotel but every year the service gets worse and worse. I've never met a more unpleasant, unhappy wait staff than the four bartenders working the bar on Monday, February 19th. I was in and out of the bar both Sunday and Monday, the 18th and 19th. I was with three other friends, we took turns buying rounds of drinks and some food. I personally spent $200 in two days, and left more than generous tips. Around 1:15am (tchnically Tuesday morning I guess) they called ""last call"" for a bar that's supposed to be open until 2am. This was no big deal, but I asked if they could throw in a pizza for me. A seemingly simple task. The same bartenders that I had been generously tipping for 48hrs refused to make me a pizza. There was absolutely no way they could throw in a pizza for me and no explanation why. They then brought their ""security staff"" in at 10 minutes before 2am and kicked us all out with unfinished drinks. Drinks we paid for, and tipped on. I've been in the service world for 10yrs and I have NEVER treated a customer like that and I think its borderline disgusting that your waitstaff would do that to the folks that are leaving them money. Aside from all of that, I really think you should hire some employees that smile once in awhile. I've never met less friendly and inviting bartenders anywhere.",Positive,,,,,
"As part of the Conference, breakfast was served and the area in the atrium blocked off.  It would have been nice to have the area opened again due to the high volume of patrons passing through.  Much later in the evening, it was reopened.",Positive,,,,,
I enjoy returning to the Hyatt each year.,Positive,,,,,
The staff was very helpful. I did tell the staff that there was a leak on the eighth floor near the elevator.  It was raining that day.,Neutral,,,,,
I missed Andy making omelets in the morning.  The fellow who took over was more than capable!,Positive,,,,,
"The only issue I had was that my room was not ready at check in time.  My luggage went in storage and I waited in the bar.  I was supposed to be called when room was ready but I never got a call.  After waiting an hour, I checked at the counter and found my room was ready.",Positive,,,,,
Nice staff and like you beds.,Positive,,,,,
only negative- cleaning team for the room- needs a little more attention to detail. The Food was night and day from prior visits. I applaud the mgmt. !! you have really made strides!,Positive,,,,,
"Rooms need some updating, lamps or plugs added next to bed enabling to charge would be great. Have KI come up with a solution.",Positive,,,,,
"This hotel needs a facelift to its dÃ©cor. The lobby looks like an 80's experience. I have seen worst in Green Bay for sure, however in order to stand above the rest of the competition you should look like you invested in the customer experience. KI is a major manufacturer of contract furniture located in Green Bay, you should use their product to enhance your space. I am not saying this due to the fact that I work there, I am stating because it make good community sense to be vested within the local tax paying companies.",Positive,,,,,
"The breakfast buffet was delightful and plentiful, however, much of the hot food was cold.",Positive,,,,,
Iâ€™ve stayed at this location in the past and itâ€™s been nothing short of exceptional. Great work with customer service for the entire staff!! Even the gentleman who came to get the pool towels to wash had a great attitude and said hi. The room was super clean and my family and I thoroughly enjoyed the amenities as well! I would definitely come back and make recommendations to our family and friends!! Thank you for providing a stupendous experience!,Positive,,,,,
"It was my first stay at your property. Lovely room, staff was wonderful. The room next door had their music a bit loud, but that stopped before it was bedtime. There was a slight leak in the bathroom sink, not enough to inconvenience me, and informed to front desk staff.",Negative,,,,,
The staff was wonderful and you have a great fitness center,Positive,,,,,
Excellent clean friendly,Positive,,,,,
Beautiful update of the lobby area!,Positive,,,,,
"The food and drink in the restaurant was very good however once our waitress left for the night the bar staff was not very attentive.  The next evening we sat at the bar with friends and had to request additional drinks when ours were empty- that should never happen.  The front desk staff and the shuttle driver, Steve, were AWESOME!",Positive,,,,,
"Best in cleanliness, quality, and updates. Will always come back to Hyatt Regency.",Positive,,,,,
"front office manager was able to get me a room when I didn't have one booked, my mistake. I needed to be there for business conference and she made it happen",Positive,,,,,
Its a nice property but needs better food at the restaurant. It has the feel and ambience of bar caliber food...mostly fried food offerings.  Need to get in the 21st century...healthy options and good clean food.,Positive,,,,,
"Good people. Mike Jubert, Carrie Jeska, and Angela Jellum are professionals. 
The entire staff is very friendly and helpful.",Positive,,,,,
Our room was chilly and we were not able to get the temperature to go any higher.,Positive,,,,,
we had a wonderful time.  We will definately come back,Positive,,,,,
"My room key locked me out 4 times.
The commode would not flush properly.
The heating system would not allow me to get the room warmer.
The hanger on your doors are very lacking in information.  I didn't realize that they were two sided.
Most hotels do not have messages on both sides and IF they do, it is worded with much bigger letters than what you have on your door hanger for - Do Not Prefer Room Service.",Positive,,,,,
Elevators were extremely slow. Loud guests can be heard all night. Beds were small and pillows uncomfortable. Rooms/hotel really dry as well. Food was mediocre at best and there was hair all over the bathroom from the previous people.,Negative,,,,,
I found everything to very convenient and comfortable.,Positive,,,,,
"The staff here ( front desk, bartender even the security lady ) were all VERY friendly! This hotel is the BEST in Green Bay and top 3 in Wisconsin! Cant beat the price for all the amenities this hotel has to offer but the staff puts it over the top!",Positive,,,,,
"I inquired about a lost item was told to call the lost and found telephone number nobody ever called me back

I was assured from the front desk staff that somebody would call me back quickly and that the telephone number for the lost and found was monitored",Positive,,,,,
Housekeeping was great.  The lounge spent to much time amongst themselves. Did not come over we went to the bar Everytime even with 3 folks on,Positive,,,,,
"The first night of the stay found the hot tub to be barely warm.  I notified the desk and found it to be sufficiently hot on the second night.  The wet steam room has some type of white growth on the ceiling and the room has an awful smell.  The dry sauna was nice although the door is not squared and cool air can be felt entering in the seat closest to it.

When is the parking gate going to be corrected?  The clerk remembered to tell me about the silver button but apparently not everyone is told because I ended up behind people who did not know what to do when the gate would not rise.  One had his ticket rejected and the other had his ticket taken but without triggering the gate.  The situation required me to have to exit my car and go up to the gate to assist.

Housekeeping was very helpful.  Re the pool area, I appreciated that families left with their children by 10PM and that an employee checked to be sure that only adults were present.

All staff were courteous although one of the gals at check-in was a bit abrupt because my name was on the registration but I was parking the car as my wife attempted to check-in.  I did the reservation as a Hyatt member but why, when my wife showed her ID with the same last name and address, did this create a problem for her so that she was still dealing with it when I got to the desk because the clerk was asking ""who is Wayne"" and ""where is he"".  Fortunately, as I arrived at the desk a more senior employee had taken over and was starting to handle the matter.  I forgot to tell my wife about Hyatt's policy because I thought that it would not be an issue since we were members and had even taken the upgrade and names and address were the same.",Positive,,,,,
"The room smelled like someone had smoked in it, the elevators are extremely slow, you could hear the cars outside, the toilet was the size and height of a pre-school toilet. Not very impressed",Positive,,,,,
"After indicating Iâ€™m a colleague at Associated Bank and breakfast at the hotel receives a 50% discount, my bill still reflected the original price and I didnâ€™t have time to discuss since I had meetings scheduled.",Positive,,,,,
"no morning newspaper, a cost cutting miscue",Positive,,,,,
"Heather at the front desk was a delight at check in. Room was quiet, peaceful. Sauna and steam room were the original reason we selected Hyatt Regency GB, but now after staying there for a weekend getaway, it was  your friendly staff & outstanding customer service are the reason we will be back in March!!",Positive,,,,,
Excellent staff. Everyone was friendly and helpful.,Positive,,,,,
It would have been nice if the hotel shuttle service to the airport was not so limited.  .,Negative,,,,,
Great place clean staff great .,Positive,,,,,
Itâ€™s convenient. The staff is friendly. The rooms are pretty nice.,Positive,,,,,
Very good would prefer Seroogyâ€™s coffee instead of Starbucks! Especially considering how close they are!,Positive,,,,,
More staff needed at front desk,Neutral,,,,,
"The stay went very well. Doing major concerts and tours across the globe can be very challenging, and the staff here made it very seamless. Gabrielle and Matthew are 2 of the reason I am very loyal and will always be to this particular property for all of our concerts in the area. As well as the entire restaurant staff, Scott in particular and all the bartenders, always go the extra mile especially when we come in late from a day in the venue. They always make us feel like we are in a second home. When traveling a lot that is actually really Sean McKinney CEO Red Rock Productions LLC",Positive,,,,,
My only complaint is that breakfast on the weekend is only served till 10am.,Negative,,,,,
"Need more towel hooks or towel bars on bathrooms, especially when travelers are asked to use towels multiple days.",Neutral,,,,,
World class! My fiancÃ© forgot some bathroom items and he was pleased with the complimentary products the hotel provided! Itâ€™s the little things that make a world of difference.,Positive,,,,,
why not free breakfast for all ???,Positive,,,,,
"My room 813, while beautiful and clean had a constant low roar from the roof ventilators, heating and air exchange.   Very annoying, but obviously, the hvac is necessary.",Positive,,,,,
Everyone was wonderful!  Absolutely one of the most gorgeous hotels.   Thank you for a wonderful stay!!,Positive,,,,,
The people at the front desk are outstanding,Positive,,,,,
We were pleasantly surprised at the size and layout of the room. Staff was good - friendly and efficient.,Positive,,,,,
"room had a very noisy fridge, and poor lighitng",Negative,,,,,
"The bed sheets were gritty, like sand in them. The toilet was loose (it wobbled) when sitting on it and the floor behind the toilet was dirty.",Negative,,,,,
"Another outstanding week at the HR Green Bay. Believe this was my 19th week at your hotel and itâ€™s the personalized service that keeps me coming back. Both Amy and Scott did an outstanding job taking care of me at breakfast - fast, thoughtful and courteous, Glenn was his usual on time and very friendly driver who Iâ€™ve come to rely on, Steve and Bill are equally reliable and gregarious as drivers, and Matthew at the front desk ensures all is done with perfection and care. A most impressive team! High kudos to the six individuals mentioned. Youâ€™ve definitely made my time away from home as pleasant as can be. My home away from home. Kind regards",Positive,,,,,
"The staff was professional and courteous. However, there were no available outlets near the bed in our room, the window was not well insulated so we froze at night under the thin quilt, and there were a few times that we waited over 4 minutes for an elevator down to the main lobby.",Positive,,,,,
The New Yearâ€™s Eve extras were nice.,Positive,,,,,
Staff was great. Honestly felt like they cared about my experience and welcomed us each time we entered hotel. Very well done Green Bay staff!!,Positive,,,,,
our stay was wonderful experience,Positive,,,,,
Mirror in bedroom was off the wall ---fell on the floor ---lucky it didn't break.  Room 804. Someone could have gotten hurt.,Positive,,,,,
The breakfast buffet was not good quality of food but also the service was very inattentive in that we were never asked about coffee refills and server was not present. Seemed more worried cleaning tables to close breakfast then attend to those there,Positive,,,,,
"We were here celebrating New Year's with all my family and reserved 6 suites. While we were happy with our room accommodations, we were definitely disappointed with the lack of entertainment in the bar on New Year's Eve. A DJ or karaoke would have been much appreciated and other guests we talked to felt the same- especially since it was-10 outside. It would be a win-win for your hotel. More drinks sold at the bar and happy guests.",Positive,,,,,
The price of the continental breakfast is a joke. Plus I have to tip on top of that!!,Positive,,,,,
Our room was below average but the manager made sure he took care of us making it a better experience.,Positive,,,,,
Paid for the bed and breakfast package was charged for breakfast anyway. Called and they took care of refunding right away.,Positive,,,,,
"Amenities, especially weight room, sauna and steam room, are second to none.",Positive,,,,,
I understand that your facility is under construction and that this causes a lot of dust. The room was very dusty. We moved the table/desk away from the wall and it was obvious that it had not been moved and cleaned under for quite some time.,Negative,,,,,
"Thank you for an enjoyable stay over the holidays.
Special thanks to Paul at check in - he was professional, helpful and an excellent representation of your organization",Positive,,,,,
Stayed on Christmas. Staff was phenomenal,Positive,,,,,
The refrigerator in the room wasnâ€™t very clean and it made slot of loud noises,Positive,,,,,
"Always very welcoming, friendly and accommodating.",Positive,,,,,
"Shower non-slip mat looked old and stained, tv in bedroom didnâ€™t work as expected. Would be nice to have more healthier options in restaurant.",Positive,,,,,
We have family in the area and stay here several times a year.  Very helpful staff.,Positive,,,,,
"Cleaning staff should take more care to ensure that bedding is actually clean. We had blood on a quilt for the pullout that we were going to use for our children...had to call for a replacement.  Bathroom had old soap clumps on the wall and hair in the tub area. Lamps weren't all working on the living room as well as the phone wasn't at all working in the living room space, had to use the one in the bedroom. Pullout sofa quilt and sheets were folded up into the bed rather than in the bedding case in the closet...then we saw the blood on it.",Positive,,,,,
Food was just ok!,Positive,,,,,
I left a note in the room. Dirty tissue under the bed to start with. Toothpaste from a previous stay on bathroom facets. toddler prints on the patio door. dust on the tables lower levels,Negative,,,,,
"I didn't remember seeing on the web site about a parking fee which was added on.
I have a room near an elevator as a preference and got a room the furthest from the elevator you could possibly get. Therefore a 9 and not a 10.",Negative,,,,,
the phone in the room was not working. also the heating system had a nuisance  noise that would recycle on and off every few minutes.,Negative,,,,,
Paul was extremely helpful and accommodating.  My room was perfect for work travel.  I will be staying here exclusively when I am in town for business.,Positive,,,,,
"Breakfast staff was untrained and playing grab butt. Coffee cold and empty cups not refilled, breakfast sandwiches served over from days before, hard cold biscuits, never offered buffet or a menu. Generally indifferent services, watched as servers spilled water pitchers on floor with out noticing or cleaning up. You've got problems.",Negative,,,,,
Excellent staff and facility.,Positive,,,,,
"The service at the breakfast buffet was absolutely AWFUL!! We were through with our meal before we FINALLY were able to flag someone down to get our server so we could get something to drink, this was the second person we asked. The first person we asked if we could get a drink wouldn't even look at us and just said that our server will do that. That breakfast experience changed my whole opinion of the hotel. The front desk staff were all veryfriendly, but the wait staff in the restaurant and breakfast buffet were some of the rudest people I made contact with in Greenbay.",Positive,,,,,
Very enjoyable weekend visit. Room was very functional and large. Bed was very comfortable. Slept very soundly. Staff was friendly and professional. Thank you.,Positive,,,,,
Very pleased!  The staff was very helpful and polite!!!,Positive,,,,,
Excellent customer service when checking in the gentleman at the front desk went above and beyond in helping us.,Positive,,,,,
"Maid service did not come and clean up room in day two.  Had to call desk. 
Otherwise excellent stay",Positive,,,,,
"House keeping did less than the bare minimum. The first day the gave us shampoo and towels and leisurely pulled the covers up to the top of the bed. Trash wasnâ€™t taken out. Just the bare minimum. The second day they didnâ€™t come at all. We called down for shampoo and body wash and were given conditioner and lotion. Twice. Neither day did housekeeping replenish the coffee station. Things were only averagely clean. They werenâ€™t terrible, but mildew and stains made it evident that they donâ€™t Take pride in what they do.",Positive,,,,,
Some of the items were very dated in the room eg door knobs,Neutral,,,,,
"In town for the Packer game.  Staff was very helpful with Packer game shuttle information at check-in.  Even though due to our travel plans we arrived before the standard check-in time, Kolton checked, our room was ready and we were able to check in early. 
After a long flight and a car ride, it was so nice to be able to drop off our bags and freshen up a bit before we went to our stadium tour.   I have many times stayed places where the staff doesn't even check if the room is ready and just repeats the check-in time and says OK when I ask if there is a way we can store our bags, so this was very noticed and appreciated. 
The room was spacious and  everything was clean and as expected.  This was a perfect stay for our Packer game girls weekend.",Positive,,,,,
The drink costs were outrageous and I could hear the banging of the games from the lobby while in my room.,Negative,,,,,
"The bathroom is very tiny and only had one small hook on which to hang anything. There were no towel bars or any way to hang up wet towels and washcloths. And since you only get clean towels after three days unless you specifically ask for them, where are you supposed to hang up your wet towels and washcloths?  Also, the price of the room was $99 when we booked the room but went up to $299 because the Packers had a home game that weekend. Ridiculous!!  And we certainly expected that breakfast would be included in the $299, but it wasn't.",Positive,,,,,
"We had a completely awful experience at this hotel. Our room was not cleaned after been gone for 9 hours. Then, when we ordered room service, they brought the wrong ice cream and no silverware (no big deal) when we called down they were so rude and said it would be a long wait. Then, after the correct ice cream was brought up, the girl asked to see the other ice cream because she thought we were lying. After this, a security guard pounded on our door and threatened to kick us out of the hotel because we â€œthrew ice cream at the girlâ€. We were shocked and felt so threatened and uncomfortable. This was a completely made up story, and when we expressed this, the security guard and waitress stormed away saying that our opinion was irrelevant and that if we left our room again we would be kicked out of the hotel.",Negative,,,,,
"I have stayed here in the past and my experience is always great. The restaurant has great food, the rooms are very nice, and the staff is helpful.",Positive,,,,,
"The people were GREAT...the hotel rooms needed to be updated, lots of use issues on walls furniture and floors but clean.",Positive,,,,,
"Came to Green Bay for our first Packers game. Staff was very welcoming, including bar/restaurant staff. Hotel was in walking distance of downtown. Overall great experience.",Positive,,,,,
We were told at check in by hotel personnel that breakfast was included. We just had to tell them our room number. We were charged over $27.00 for a very blah tasting breakfast buffet. Very deceptive to make us think it was included. Will not stay here again.,Negative,,,,,
We stopped at the front desk while visiting the Coffee Shop and requested additional shampoo and conditioners as well as q-tips.  The staff member told us that she didnâ€™t have any behind the desk but would send them upstairs to our room.  No one EVER came.  We were very disappointed as there wasnâ€™t enough of the product in the room to meet the needs of our party.  We were also disappointed that we had to pay to park in the lot.,Negative,,,,,
"Kaia at Front Desk was great, it was my first stay at Hyatt and she made the difference with her personal attention.",Positive,,,,,
Breakfast ended too early for us.,Positive,,,,,
"The room was very nice but unfortunately an adjoining room contained what must have been a very large air handler. It made sleep extremely difficult which was an issue simply because on the following morning I was to have major surgery. Not a good sleep unfortunately. Otherwise, a nice place to stay!",Positive,,,,,
GB Hyatt was fine & as expected.   I have had continuing issues with Hyatt Corporate,Positive,,,,,
The heater in my room didn't function at all - I was provided a portable heater the second night.,Positive,,,,,
I hate getting all these damn emails,Negative,,,,,
I had a very nice stay. Thank you.,Positive,,,,,
Everything was great,Positive,,,,,
Lots of light switches in the room. Two of which didn't seem to do anything (?),Positive,,,,,
Great hotel,Positive,,,,,
"We were there for 2 days prior to a game day.  The breakfast staff knew they were going to be extra busy at breakfast on game day but failed miserably in service and food replenishment.  I could not see someone keeping on track on the food and letting the kitchen staff know of low supply.  I waited for 10 minutes for replenishment of the bagels/toast, I asked someone who said they would sort out, it was not replenished by the time I left.  I had to ask someone for coffee.  When I mentioned it upon check out that my husband and I didn't have much to eat (as could not continue to wait), there was no acknowledgement by the wait staff or letting the guests know how long they would likely have to wait. The staff at the reception were very accommodating and provided me with  money to spend at the cafe as my room rate also included breakfast.  They also discounted the car parking rate, so this was satisfactory to me, although next time I will not include any breakfast.  I have stayed at the hotel on past occasion and was happy that is why we returned even though the rate was extremely high compared to other accoms in the area.",Positive,,,,,
"At breakfast on Sun -  We did not have a server wait on us, the computer system was down, I was charged for breakfast but at checkout the charge was removed",Positive,,,,,
The food at the restaurant and for breakfast were ok.  I guess I expected better food from the Hyatt.,Positive,,,,,
We went to the restaurant and had horrible service.  The waiter took a long time to come ask about drinks.  We also ordered a house cookie and when it came it was burnt and couldn't eat it.  When told the waiter about it he said there was nothing he could do.  He said he would not have us pay for a soda (which was $3.00) and ended up not taking it off the bill.  Not sure that I would stay at the Hyatt in Green Bay again due to that.,Negative,,,,,
call for explanation,Neutral,,,,,
Every thing great except toilets too low.,Positive,,,,,
Room was very dirty. Asked for 2 pack n plays for our twins at the reservation. Only 1 in the room. Didn't bring second one to room until hours later.,Negative,,,,,
The breakfast buffet is weak!,Positive,,,,,
"although i did receive a food credit, the whole room service experience was a fiasco",Positive,,,,,
I thought that the prices at your bar were a little extreme. $10.50 for a shelf brand bourbon manhattan is outrageous for a location like Green Bay. I stayed at the Gild Hall lhotel in Manhattan last week. This hotel is located in NYC Financial District and the bar prices were not too much higher than yours.,Negative,,,,,
"I was travelling and needed an unexpected stop in Green Bay to break the drive.  I used the App to find a Hyatt, check its pet and parking policy (as I had both a car and a dog) and then paid for my room 20 minutes before I arrived at the hotel.  On check in I was told the pet fee is $100 per night.  There is nothing on the app on pet fees, but is on parking.  When I asked the manager I could either cancel and loose the payment on the room due to being inside the wrong time frame or pay the money.  I asked for confirmation on where on the App it talks about pet fees and they could only provide me information from the web.  I should not have to check the web for this information, not when it is so clearly written in the app on the car parking charges.  $100 is too steep - my dog went from his carry bag into his crate without touching the carpet or furniture.  No deep clean was needed, and how much deep cleaning is done for $100 anyway.  Kids that were running wild in the hotel would have used more time of your cleaning staff than my dog, but they stay for free.  Seriously bad customer service by Hyatt not to declare the fee on the App when advertising you are pet friendly and then to have the staff be so unhelpful in explaining it when raised.  Very disappointed.",Negative,,,,,
We'll be back! Only complaints was that our refrigerator wasn't very cold. Almost warm. No dresser or chair. We did enjoy our stay. Lovely!,Positive,,,,,
"I always check for bedbugs at any hotel, even 5-star. In doing so I always notice whether anyone cleans in the corners, under the beds, behind headboards, etc. You may want to do an annual deep-clean on the rooms, because it looks like no one has cleaned those areas for years (or ever). It's not a big deal, but if those areas aren't being cleaned, then bedbugs could technically hide there and never be found.",Positive,,,,,

"Our room was never cleaned on Friday. We slept in and we're in the room when housekeeping knocked on the door. We said we would be leaving in 10 minutes which we did. Upon returning later that night we found out room just as we left it. The biggest issue was not having had the coffee cups, coffee, water and tea replenished. We had to go out for our morning beverages instead of making them in the room.",Positive,,,,,
We told the front desk clerk when checking out that the sensor on the night light appeared to be malfunctioning.  It lit up about every 30 seconds all night - we had to cover the nightstand with clothing just to darken the room enough to sleep.,Negative,,,,,

It was a very pleasant stay!,Positive,,,,,
"The hotel needs to fix the heating/cooling system that MANY people have complained about in reviews.   My first room was FREEZING, and the staff's solution was to send up crappy little space heaters (which they turned on and left unattended in my room).  They also gave me a bullsh*t excuse that 'the engineers are working on the temperature issues' -- which I know was a complete LIE, since this problem has been going on for MONTHS.
Guests aren't stupid, and we don't like being lied to.   No way in hell will I recommend this hotel to ANYONE.",Negative,,,,,
"The only issue I had was I couldn't get the thermostat to stay up.  It was set at 69.5 and I couldn't figure out how to get it higher.  By the next morning it was up to 70.5, but then when I came back after my classes it was back down to 69.5.  I should have called the desk, but it was fine, I just used the extra blanket.",Positive,,,,,
"Breakfast was great, however the change in bringing over my drink by staff was frustrating.  The staff is great but with a big conference staying there they cannot keep up with everyone's drinks and it was nearly impossible to get a refill on water and coffee.",Positive,,,,,

Room seemed in need of updating. Old painting not done well. Tiles broken. Not as nice as another room we have stayed in.,Positive,,,,,
Fantastic facility and staff - thank you.,Positive,,,,,
Couple of things. I was told that the garage I was parking in was free it was not. I was told the hotel lot was $8.75 per hour it was not. So I ended up paying for parking. I was also told when booking the room there would be breakfast included and then was billed for four breakfasts but three of them weren't even mine. Otherwise everything was great the night staff was great except the nighttime house keeping never brought anything we asked for. Everything else was amazing,Positive,,,,,

"When we chose to stay in the Hyatt Regency, we chose it because it had a hot tub.  Unfortunately, when we got into it on Friday, we were disappointed with how cold it was.  We chalked it up to overuse, or poor temperature management.  We were out and about on Saturday, but we decided to take a dip on Sunday before leaving, and it was even COLDER!  I was disappointed in that because that was one of the two requirements we wanted for our rare kid-less weekend get away... 
We were also double-charged for breakfast and I had to call to get a refund.  
The rooms were nice and quiet, and the staff was accommodating, but unfortunately, I don't think that we would be staying there again.",Negative,,,,,
"Overall I loved my stay! The staff was very friendly. (I think the question about if they sincerely care is a little odd, btw. Caring vs good service are two very different things.) My only issue is that the phone wasn't charged so the receiver did not work.",Positive,,,,,
"This is obviously not the Hyatt Regency brand hotel that I have used in the past.  The bathrooms speak it best -- cheap, plastic toilet seats on undersized toilets tells it all.  But this is Green Bay, WI not a major City, so as long as the price is right it's okay.  but the staff was well trained and attentive.  That works well in any hotel.",Positive,,,,,
"the TV paper guide for channels was incorrect. Not a big deal, but I thought I'd mention it.",Positive,,,,,
"The room was comfortable and clean.  The pool area looked nice, but we didn't use it.  Also liked the fact that they had family games available in the atrium, which I think is great if you are traveling with kids.
We had a drink in the bar and the only thing bad to say was there was a male there who was obviously drunk and obnoxiously loud.  I was relieved when he and his friends left.",Positive,,,,,
The noise from the atrium was VERY loud in our room.,Negative,,,,,
The Staff at the Hotel Restaurant were awesome -- service was very slow but I feel they were very understaffed for such an event and the staff is not to blame. We waited a long time to place an order for food and to finally get it after ordering. But again I must say they were very nice and I hate to complain but hopefully the next time they are staffed appropriately.,Negative,,,,,
Heat didn't work in my room.  Received a space heater for room.  Hot tub in pool area was very cold.  Barely warmer than pool.,Positive,,,,,
It was my first time staying at a Hyatt and it was very enjoyable! I wasn't sure what to expect but I was pleased.,Positive,,,,,
"My only complaint is that there was clear evidence the room had not been cleaned very well. Hair in the tub, garbage in the waste baskets, tooth pick on the floor under the sink, crumbs on carpet.",Negative,,,,,
I was told room service would arrive in 20 minutes.  Two and a half hours later the food was still not there.  Just be honest with your customers and tell them when you cannot meet expectations.  Your hotel was grossly understaffed where there was a Packer Game down the road.,Negative,,,,,
Check out during a large conference should have all registers open- shuttle driver is terrific - receipts including tips would be useful for business travelers who need to put on expense reports- parking is a bit awkward - would like process on confirmation for room,Positive,,,,,
My only negative comment would be not having Kleenex in the bathroom.  It was the beds.  Maybe have two boxes in each room.,Negative,,,,,

"The ticket system for the parking lot was not working very well, but management did open the gate for the weekend and then later provided a green exit ticket that worked.",Positive,,,,,
The breakfast was amazing but the food at the restaurant was very over salted and made me and my significant other feel very ill afterwards,Positive,,,,,
"The elevators have to the slowest ones I have ever ridden therefore it took forever to get one to our floor.  The maid service was poor, the second day our beds were partially made, the soap and shampoo were not replenished, I dropped a plastic top on the bathroom floor and it rolled under the sink.  Two days later the top was still in the same place.  Think that area ever got cleaned?",Negative,,,,,
Slow elevators,Negative,,,,,
Went to the Pub for food and drinks after the packer game.  We waited 2 hours for our food to arrive.  Half of our party left after 90 minutes.  They brought our initial drinks then NEVER came back to take another drink order or offer an explanation of why it was taking so long!  We ended up telling our waiter we were leaving if food not delivered ASAP (we had already told him to cancel the order of the person who left) he still did not take another drink order or refill water. We sat in a booth for 2 hours- only had a total of 2 drinks before our food came -  very poor service.  If this bar is not making money now you know why .,Negative,,,,,
"I love the location and the friendliness of the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. But the hotel would benefit from a bit of sprucing up. My room was lovely, but there were places (particularly near the bathroom) where the carpet was pulling up and you could see the floor underneath. The bed had that 'slope' hotel beds get when too many guests have slept on the same side of the bed. It made it a bit frustrating to get comfortable. It would have also been great to have some directions on how to use the thermostat. It took a while for me to figure it out. 

From a ""what I liked best"" standpoint - aside from the excellent staff - was how quiet the hotel was. I was there on a Packers game weekend (when the Packers won) and was really anticipating a lot of noise, particularly with the big echo-y lobby area. But I barely heard anything. It was great.",Positive,,,,,

I was told the hotel was completely ""booked"" - justifying the inflated price of $309 plus tax.  A lie, there were plenty of available rooms.  And no, I was not in GB for the Packers game.  Inflating prices on a third-rate hotel is not something I expected from Hyatt.",Negative,,,,,

"The service in the restaurant was terrible.  The first night, our group was almost the only ones there and it took over 2 hours for us to get food and eat.  It took over 20 minutes to get our checks.  The server seemed overwhelmed, and when some in our party went to the bar for another drink, the bartender told them, ""you have a server for that.""
The lunch I got the next day was a bit quicker, but still seemed slow.
Dinner the next night was a repeat---very slow.
Food service for the meeting I attended was awkward---plated sandwich and chips, so the chips were soggy from being in the fridge.  No condiments on the tables, so eventually there was a server walking around with boxes of mayo and mustard packets having guests help themselves.  The soup came last, was absolutely tasteless, and was lukewarm.  I would expect better food service to be associated with such a large conference center.",Positive,,,,,
i thought beer was overpriced,Negative,,,,,
I ate at the restaurant--we had a table of 8 and our server was really trying his best. A few of us wanted a refill on our drink so we went up to the bar. The bartender told us that we had a server and should go back to our table and wait for him to get our drinks. There were 3 other people at the bar and she was NOT busy. As a former bartender and server--I thought this was astounding that she wasn't willing to help make a drink as he ran his tail off.,Positive,,,,,
"Upon arriving in my room, as first glance everything seemed clean! However, at bed time I turned back the covers, of the bed closest to the window in room 520, to find sheets with old blood stains that never bleached out. The bed had not been slept in, and it was on both pillow cases and on the flat sheet. I wondered why the maid would have made the bed & left them on and not seen that?
Also, the bed closest to the closet has sheets that had fraying long strips, but it was clean with no blood stains. I did report it to the manager on duty on the 7th and she was going to talk to housekeeping? 
This is the first time I ever saw something like that I and travel a lot!

"My only complaint has to do with paying $7 for overnight parking.  I had dinner with a friend at the Pub and she was able to get her parking ticket validated so that she did not have to pay for parking.  I just think given the fact that I was a paying hotel guest that parking should be included.  I have stayed at the hotel previously and never had to pay for parking.  I was with a larger group, but there was no mention of parking fees.  I found this to be a big dissatisfier.",Positive,,,,,
My heater didnâ€™t work well.,Positive,,,,,
"We live this hotel. This was our first time taking our dog. We were a little disappointed with the unexpected $100 pet fee. I understand to an extent, but I would not consider taking our dog if he was not well trained. He does not mess indoors, is non shedding, does not chew, 13lbs and harmless. 
One other suggestion would be an upgrade to the iron and ironing boards.",Negative,,,,,
"The overall experience was fine, however the food service in the bar was EXTREMELY slow.  The only person on duty the even of 11/16 was well intentioned, but he was obviously in over his head....and it was a very slow night.",Positive,,,,,

"I had two issues during this stay:
1) Dirty shower. My shower had not been cleaned, as evidenced by multiple pieces of hair (5+) and by the used dry washcloth hanging on the shower rod. I discovered this in the morning when I was in a rush, so I did not have time to request housekeeping service.
2) Parking. There was no space in the hotel lot, so I was directed to parking in the ramp across the street. The front desk informed me that parking would be complimentary in the ramp and that weekend parking was free after 6 pm on Friday. The front desk worker noted that it was about 5 pm but said that should be ""fine"". When I checked out, I asked the front desk if I needed anything for the ramp parking. I was assured that I did not. When I exited the ramp, my scanned ticket indicated that I owed 85 cents for parking. Certainly a small amount, but definitely a hassle when my purse was not easily within reach and there several cars in line behind me. It was ridiculous to put an 85 cent charge on my credit card.
Both of these things occurring within an hour did not lead to a very good start to my day, especially one in which I had to drive 5 hours.",Positive,,,,,
Parking if Friday when we arrived was a disaster.  No place to park in lot.  Also parking structure was full. Andy you actually have to pay to park on lot.  Thatâ€™s ridiculous.,Negative,,,,,
I have been attending the WI wrestling coaches association clinic and have enjoyed the breakfast buffet the last two years and don't understand how each year the staff is so surprised by the amount of food that is gone through and how much difficulty they are having keeping up.  I was told they were out of chocolate milk.  I was able to get an omelet but later when my wife went to get one they were out of over half of the ingredients.  Then she tried to get some bread and it was gone and then went for some oatmeal and that was gone.  We ran into similar but not as bad of situations last year.,Positive,,,,,

Just feel that Hometown brides that book months to a year in advance and then are just given no consideration when packer schedule comes out is crazy.

"At check in I was not informed about the breakfast option/price and the fact that my room was booked with a breakfast discount.  Also, the parking lot was full (even though my room had complimentary parking) so I had to use the ramp across the street.  I was reimbursed for the ramp fees, but it was a little more inconvenient.",Positive,,,,,
I dislike that we are unable to control the temperature of our room.  HUGE issue!,Negative,,,,,
"I stayed here on Friday night before I took my dad on the Honor Flight. First making the reservation was extremely difficult, I had to talk to multiple different people, was put on hold for over 30 minutes as nobody seemed to understand what the Flight of Champions was or the discount involved. In fact, I had to call back 2 times to get it resolved and actually get a room booked. Then I called back as instructed to schedule my shuttle for the airport on Saturday morning. I scheduled my dad and myself and was told that only 2 other people were scheduled for the shuttle. I also confirmed this the night we checked in. At check in, I was the 3rd person in line. There was only one person at the desk checking people in on a Friday night. She was nice but then all of the sudden I saw another guy come out of the back room and he didn't help her at all. I had no idea what he was doing but it would have been nice to have another person help with checking in. The next morning my dad and I got up at 3am - got ready and went downstairs to check out at 3:45am. We were putting our items in the car at 3:50 when the shuttle left without us. I went back in to the desk and the person working said ""the shuttle was full"". I'm like....well I had a reservation that I scheduled 2 weeks ago!! And we were not on it - so who took our spot? The only suggestion was that we get a taxi or an uber that would make us late for getting to the airport. That did not seem like good customer service to me - it was a huge disappointment as we were not the only people who were left behind on a very important day!! I ended up driving myself and another veteran and his son to the airport. This was a terrible way to start the day - and it was the hotel's fault.
Then we are trying to exit and then gate is broke - it took extra time to even get out of the parking lot. A friend of ours had to drive back around, get out and go talk to someone in the hotel to open it. So, no, my experience here was a disaster.",Positive,,,,,
Connor was very professional and pleasant when we arrived.  We had a quick check in as well.,Positive,,,,,
I would suggest that you upgrade the toilets as they are small (for a larger person) to sit on properly.  Also if you host another State of Wis. Tavern League convention add additional bar staff.,Positive,,,,,

"the vents in the room were all caked with dust, The toilet is so small and there is no handicap bar, no light in the tiny little hallway so I couldn't figure out how to deal with the temp.  Yelling in the atrium from people attending a conference at night was not acceptable. Went to the pub the last night I was there sat down at a table and no one came over to say hello or ask me if I wanted to order anything.  Not enough light in the atrium felt dark and old.",Negative,,,,,
"Pub 333 on Monday night - service was terrible! I get that it was a Packers' home game - and with the Tavern League in-house - you were busy.  But even more of a reason to have the place property staffed.  I had to interrupt the bartenders (two of them) having a bs conversation, to ask to have a server come to my table to take my dinner order.

My food came out incomplete (no au ju for my French dip sandwich) . . . no server to be found so again, I had to ask someone to find her for me.

"I thought the stay was overall very good. The hotel was in good shape and the room was nice. People at the front desk were very helpful. The one thing I would comment on is the air conditioning in the room was inadequate.

"Overall good.  Needs some updating in design however.  Elevator is slow, splash pad is super cool but smells mildewy.  All the staff were great!  Breakfast left a lot to be desired for, especially since it was not included in the room.",Positive,,,,,
My room was freezing and the family members in floors below mine (2 & 3) were very warm.  I did love that with an additional fee I could bring my pet and the rooms were so clean with no pet smells or hair etc.  The parking lot exit gates were broke and we could not leave on Sunday without running over the curb.,Negative,,,,,
The a/c panel was broken on our first night. We called down to front desk who sent up security. They said someone would be in first thing in the morning (Sunday). This never happened. Luckily we could crack the sliding door for ventilation and it was cool outside. The bathroom was excruciatingly tiny. The room was lacking but the staff was all phenomenal!,Negative,,,,,
"No issues with my stay, everything was wonderful.",Positive,,,,,
Bathroom needs exhaust fan.,Positive,,,,,
Breakfast was a little high priced.   Front desk personal were Great,Positive,,,,,
The heating system in the room was very uncomfortable.  The blower was loud and the room was very cold,Negative,,,,,
"We chose this Hyatt as it was the designated hotel for our nephews wedding.  Needing 3 rooms for our family, the reservation needs changed several times.  The reservation staff handled all these changes wonderfully.  Staff was friendly when we were there and our rooms were very comfortable.",Positive,,,,,
Your TV service sucks. The bedroom & front room had different channels and those didnâ€™t match the on screen guides,Positive,,,,,
The guest room are dated and need some updating. The carpeting looks pretty old. It looks like the lobby is much more taken care off when compared to the guest rooms.  Bathrooms are also pretty small.,Positive,,,,,
The food was delicious!!!!,Positive,,,,,
Your staff was very friendly and helpful. We were there for a wedding and we were able to do a later checkout at 1:00 which helped tremendously!  Thank you very much,Positive,,,,,
Breakfast buffet was terrible. Food was cold. Sausage gravy tastless,Negative,,,,,
Clean and well kept. The only issue was the heat! We couldnâ€™t get our room cool no matter if we turned the heat down.,Positive,,,,,
So glad to not have to stay in our first room on the third floor with no windows. Very claustrophobic. Second room was wonderful.,Positive,,,,,
"Our room was not fully cleaned. There was good left in the refrigerator and when we moved an ottoman there were email clippings on the floor.
The heat wasn't working so we were given a space heater.",Positive,,,,,
What I dislike about the Hyatt is the fact that there is not anything else going on in downtown green bay..........it is quite desolate.,Negative,,,,,
Need more suitcase and package trolleys. Only 4?? Was very hard unloading and for bringing items to the wedding. Although the front desk did eventually hold a large present for me for bridal party.,Positive,,,,,
Room temp never above 67. Told front desk and offered a blanket and space heater.  Bathroom not clean. Food service slow and food quality fair. Will not be returning on future trips to Green Bay.,Positive,,,,,
breakfast buffet has a great variety however scrambled eggs and oatmeal were cold.  Air exchange vent in the bathroom was filthy causing issues with allergies.  carpet was loose under the threshold by bathroom/hallway and someone will get hurt.  couldn't adjust temp in room so cold.  never got text that room was ready.,Positive,,,,,
Housekeeping arrived to clean my room and I was just leaving for a conference session in 5 minutes so she said she would come back and never returned.  We put an empty pizza box next to the garbage can on the 3rd floor by the elevator and it sat there for 2 days.,Neutral,,,,,
"The staff were very accommodating.  I checked into the first room and there was a blue power fan blowing in the bedroom, when I questioned it I was changed to a different room down the hall.  I then noticed, during the middle of the night, in the second room that the carpeting was saturated by the window.  Green Bay had some terrible rain, 10/1, and I think the windows on the 8th floor leaked.  The people at the front desk responded right away and a blue power fan was placed in the room and the carpet was dry when I came back that afternoon.",Negative,,,,,
"My bedroom remote did not work, the night light next to the bed did not work.",Positive,,,,,
"First person I encountered at the front desk told me there was no opportunity to check in early. A little over an hour later I decided to try again, and this time I got Paul, who was very accommodating.",Positive,,,,,
Great hotel. We will be back again.,Positive,,,,,
"Disliked having to text for information. No option to just talk to someone.
Also would have liked instructions in the room regarding the temperature control. Both nights the temperature crept up",Positive,,,,,
"The only bad thing I can say is Justine stated she would comp our breakfast in the morning as it was my husbandâ€™s birthday (the reason for our get-a-way) but to my dismay, my bankcard was charged for the meal!",Positive,,,,,
Parking was a little unclear as far as how to validate initially and where to park prior to checkin. The gates made me assume I couldn't get in without being checked it. Front desk was very helpful on this though.,Positive,,,,,
"The toilet would not flush when I first checked in.  I tried to call the front desk several times, but no one answered because they were busy.  So I went down to the desk, and they sent someone right away, and it was fixed quickly.
I couldn't get the room to warm up in spite of trying to adjust the thermostat.  The worst part was that the fan ran constantly and was very noisy.  I'm a light sleeper, so I didn't get much sleep due to the noise.
The price and location were great.",Positive,,,,,
"Just a little something I noticed in the bathroom. Tee vent under the sink was dirty/dusty. Out of sight, out of mind but couldn't help but notice it from the ""sitting"" position! I forgot to have my parking validated, my own fault but the desk clerk might want to make this a habit of asking. It was a busy weekend, so, she may have asked others, I just got missed. No big deal!",Negative,,,,,
Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful.  My issue with the hotel is more one you can't change - I'm not a big fan of the big open atrium and the elevator took a long time.  But the people made we want to come back.,Positive,,,,,
"The heat didn't work and the front desk told us that they don't turn it on until late fall.
Staff was fine.
Breakfast was acceptable but they took away the coffee urns on Monday.",Positive,,,,,
"Overall, the rooms seemed clean.  However, one of the glassware on the kitchen bar area was dirty and the paper coasters they were placed on looked reused!  They had greasy spots on them!",Negative,,,,,
Clean and nice hotel. Would stay here again,Positive,,,,,
"The pull out bed was unacceptable. The blanket had stains on it, including blood. The mattress had blood stains on it as well. Housekeeping did promptly bring me new bedding, but it was very disturbing to know I was sleeping on blood. I did take pictures of both the ""clean"" blanket and the mattress. I think Housekeeping needs to make sure to always check the pull out beds, and the hotel itself needs to keep better track of when mattress need to be cleaner and/or replaced.",Positive,,,,,
"We didn't have enough washcloths in the room for everyone, only two. Not critical, but it wouldn't been nice.",Negative,,,,,
Whomever checked us in was outstanding.  I believe these name was Justin.  Helped me with taking medical equipment to our room when a baggage cart was unavailable.  You are so blessed to have this caring employee.   I'm so impressed!!!,Positive,,,,,
"Pleasant atmosphere, my favorite Hyatt Hotel I've stayed so far.",Positive,,,,,
The hotel is sparkling clean and the staff was very friendly. All of the banquet food at SMMC was very good. Could use more outlets in the rooms.,Positive,,,,,
"Bathrooms are very small and do not include an exhaust fan.  
Front desk staff was doing a good job checking in several groups.  Manager came out of office and asked employee if it was 1 or more groups.  Did not offer to help or speak/look at any of the guests; poor example of customer service.",Positive,,,,,
"Had a nice stay.  Beautiful hotel. Thought restaurant was a bit pricey, didn't really like having to get a ticket validated for parking and have it with us to leave. Also, we had 2 small children with us and was a little nervous with the railings",Positive,,,,,
"Paul helped above and beyond. He came to my room and showed me how to use the phone, log on to the internet, and brought up milk and cookies when I said there were no cookies in the gift shop.",Positive,,,,,
"Inconsistent messaging on tax exempt process, not upfront about parking fee's, very loud lobby, slamming doors all night, room very hot and humid, air conditioning doesn't keep up, water leaking in doors from rain, pillows to big and no variety of sizes - no sleep at all",Negative,,,,,
A very nice hotel.  Great work out room and restaurant.,Positive,,,,,
The only thing I was disappointed about was that the free shuttle to the airport was not available when I needed it. (the driver wasn't starting until 1:00pm) so I had to spend $35.00 on a taxi to get to the airport,Positive,,,,,
We were amazed at the inside of the hotel. Beautiful! We will be back.,Positive,,,,,
Kaia was the most helpful front desk staff I have encountered in all these years.,Positive,,,,,
Buffet breakfast food at 9.30 was not very appetizing,Positive,,,,,
We enjoyed our stay very much,Positive,,,,,
Rey and Justin as well as all the staff were fantastic,Positive,,,,,
"Please make sure that the pillow cases are clean, and the bathroom around the cab it's clean, there is plenty of pool towels, and when going to get your free meal that comes with the or Room it would be best not to have people following you around and then when leaving calling you back to give you a ticket because it was that explained how it all worked for complementary meal.  My nursing daughter when it to take her food back to the Room so she can take care of her baby. She was escorted from the elevator back to the dining Room to get her ticket and she would explained in the beginning that it comes with her meal and no one told her anything else.",Positive,,,,,
We had to call security twice because of noisy neighbors in the room next door(#729). Nearly ruined our stay,Negative,,,,,
"I rated the condition of hotel a 8 because there could be a couple of paint touch up spots In bathroom,  i beleive the problem is because the fan in the bathroom wasn't working.",Negative,,,,,
Need more gluten-free options,Neutral,,,,,
"The hotel staff lacked experience and professionalism. When I initially called to book the room, I was told by a guest support specialist that you were not able to match Hotels.com's room price of $130. After a frustrating 45 minute conversation with your booking department, I hung up and booked through Hotels.com. When we checked in, we were checked under a separate reservation (which was not made by us) through the hotel directly. We were charged again after we had prepaid over a month ago through Hotels.com. Additionally, we were not placed in a room next to the rest of our family as we had requested. When we complained about the double charge and not being next to our family, we were treated very poorly and I was blamed for your mistake. So long story short, we ended up paying $700 for two nights on the other side of the hotel (we were there for my niece's birthday). Hopefully the additional $400 will be refunded, however I have no trust at this point. Also important to note, my sister and father only paid $120 for their rooms (same room that you refused to give me for $130). Very pretty building, but terrible customer service. This was my first stay at a Hyatt. For me, it felt like lipstick on pig. I was very unimpressed with the whole experience.",Negative,,,,,
"I absolutely loved the hotel and our room. However, when checking out I found $70 worth of food was charged to our room. The staff was helpful and did remove these charges, but it makes me leery to know anyone eating at the hotel restaurant can give whatever room they choose to give and itll be charged.",Positive,,,,,
"TV didnâ€™t work in BR.  No fresh towels on day2, trash not emptied, other guests were were making loud noises at 2am.",Neutral,,,,,
The staff was amazing!  Everyone was very welcoming and accommodating the entire time.  Great job!,Positive,,,,,
"My stay here was wonderful! (Once I got over my fear of heights and glass elevators ;) ) The staff was incredible, starting from my initial check in and through the entire week. Everyone was very friendly and helpful, whether they had been working there for a while or even just a few days! My room was clean and comfortable, there was excellent signage showing where things were and what was available, and the stay was just overall excellent.",Positive,,,,,
What a fantastic experience I had. Your customer service and friendly staff are way above a 10. I want to go back to Green Bay just to stay here again. Excellent job.,Positive,,,,,
"Room #313 felt very uncomfortable and unsafe. Weird layout, very basement-like darkness (even it is 3rd floor room), no windows and an extra door in addition to the co-joining door that i didn't not have control of locking/unlocking created very unpleasant feeling just in few seconds of entering the room. I don't see many people  wanting to take a risk of staying in the room when you don't know who has a key to get in inside through that extra door while you are asleep. Hotel was sold out, so only after my very strong ""encouragement"" to the hotel staff of switching up rooms and 15 minutes of waiting in the hallway ( that was recommended by the staff on the phone), I finally went to talk to someone at he frontdesk and was able to get a different room. That room was good, but the experience and the time spent waiting for the solution was unnecessary.",Negative,,,,,
Your Team in Green Bay is awesome. The GM is great and it shows in the Teams Attitude. The Director of Sales and Events Tracy well words cannot describe she is the best ever. The Chef at and the Culinary Team at the Property was the best ever. The entire Team was outstanding. Hyatt should be honored to have this property and team in the portfolio.,Positive,,,,,
Pull out mattress was filthy.,Negative,,,,,
Hotel was loud. Main atrium loud at 2am and again at 7:30am. Staff unable to control lots guests in open atrium created problems.,Negative,,,,,
Great hotel and service.,Positive,,,,,
Everyone was very professional and cared about their areas and made my time there enjoyable.,Positive,,,,,
"Excellent location near things to do in downtown Green Bay. It's especially great for Packers games, as the city bus picks up right in front of the hotel to take you to the game and drops you off after the game. The staff was courteous and friendly. They also provided pizza in the lobby for this particular gameday, which was a nice touch.",Positive,,,,,
I was very impressed by Hyatt Green Bay. Paul greeted me by name which was totally unexpected. The bbq sandwich in the 333 was really good. The room was very clean and spacious and provided privacy. Thanks Hyatt Green Bay,Positive,,,,,
Air conditioning in the rooms does not work. My coworker had the same thing in his room. The HVAC barely pushes out air so the rooms were stuffy with stale air. Pub menu seemed very processed and fried. Rooms were not the cleanest. Lots of hairs laying around and stains on the furniture. I didnâ€™t have shampoo in my room. I slept maybe 3 hours due to the bad HVAC. I will try to avoid this hotel in the future if at all possible.,Negative,,,,,
"Service and accommodations were very good.  However,  my room smelled as though there had been a smoker the previously.",Positive,,,,,
Great stay and friendly staff especially (Tracy- Director of Sales).  She's awesome and I will bring my business back there because of her.,Positive,,,,,
"The air conditioning unit in my room did not work. The room was very hot during my stay with no ability to control the temperature. Other than this, my stay was enjoyable.",Positive,,,,,
Sink did not drain.,Positive,,,,,
"Great location, went to the Broncos packers game. Everyone was very professional and Courteous.   As a Hyatt Employee I know what to expect and how things are run. They did a very great job",Positive,,,,,
The room was nice and clean. The temperature of the room was hot and the thermostat did not work to turn it down. The room was not worth $360 a night. As much as the room cost you would of thought breakfast was free.,Positive,,,,,
Hotel / Rooms very outdated.,Negative,,,,,
"Room was dusty, dirty, musty and mattress pad had stains on it upon arrival.   Hotel is old and rooms are dingy.  Water stain rings on The end table upon check in.  Dusty behind beds & nightstands.   HV/AC doesnâ€™t work well.",Negative,,,,,
"Noise level was higher than normal, but I was on a lower level and near an elevator. My exterior was the mechanical system.",Positive,,,,,
"main problem with the sleeping room was lack of outlets for computer cord. Room 201 had only a round table  (no desk) in the middle of the room with no near outlet.

Also, the mat for the shower in bathroom was very dirty so I just tossed under the sink

Excellent pool for laps; good food at the pub/bar

Nice meeting space",Positive,,,,,
I was not offered the option to join a rewards program. I would have been interested!,Positive,,,,,
We stayed with the Small Market Meetings conference and the staff was so amazing. The little things they did for the conference was awesome. I especially like the Amenity Roundabout that was such a great idea and I have never seen that before. Thanks again for a great time.,Positive,,,,,
We love this hotel. The staff are amazing as is the service and the value.,Positive,,,,,
"Staff was very nice. Hotel needs an upgrade, and food was below standard for Hyattâ€™s I have stayed at in the past.",Positive,,,,,
"It would be nice to complimentary coffee for early morning risers (in the lobby).
I was up at 5am and need my fix so I ended up going to next door hotel 

Everything else was wonderful!",Positive,,,,,
"Very well maintained property.  This was our third stay for a packers game, most definatley would stay again",Positive,,,,,
"I was surprised to see the additional fee for parking. 

We ordered 3 spotted cows on tap from the bar. The beers were clearly an IPA. I questioned the bartender and the manager and they both said itâ€™s spotted cow. I ordered a spotted cow in a bottle for comparison and it had a completely different color and taste from the 3 other beers. Not a huge deal but your staff should listen to the patrons. Eventually they poured out the entire barrel of what I assume was a delicious IPA or possibly moon man.",Positive,,,,,
The game day menu in the bar is woefully inadequate.,Negative,,,,,
"The overall experience was laid back yet professional. Being from Chicago where the stay at the Hyatt Regency would be much more, I was wondering if the experience would be the same. The bed was super comfortable, shower pressure incredible, size of the room spacious; I wish I could had spent another night.",Positive,,,,,
No issues.  I always enjoy staying there.,Positive,,,,,
"Kaia at the front desk was the best. I had asked if there were any places to rent a bike so she searched for me and found there was a bike place a couple of blocks away she wasn't sure if they rented so I said I can just call them and instead of giving me the # she called and asked for me, now that's customer service!!!  Kaia also said after I checked in if there is anything you need my name is Kaia and I'm here to help.  I never get that from other hotel front desk associates.  This is what makes her stand out.  Please recognize her for her wonderful customer service she definitely is great!!  Kaia's service will definitely enlighten people and might make them want to book again at your hotel.  Thanks, Scott Paradis Guest room 619",Positive,,,,,
"Our parking ticket was validated because of our stay, but when we went to leave, we were surprised when it popped up at $67 was due on exit. We pushed the button for help and someone must have just cleared it for us and let us exit, but that was surprising, so if there is a way to avoid that in the future for guests I think that would be preferable.",Positive,,,,,
Nice hotel for the price point!,Positive,,,,,
Pleasant stay.  Staff were very accommodating. Only interaction was brief checkin/out,Positive,,,,,
Would like to see more variety of fruit for the children,Positive,,,,,
Very large business rooms! Soft beds.,Positive,,,,,
Excellent as always!,Positive,,,,,
"It was a Packer game so extraordinarily expensive. The bathroom door was dirty and the nightstand lower shelf full of dust- when charged exorbitant prices, my expectations are higher than a budget hotel. Even though there were 4 of us in a 1 bedroom suite, there were amenities(towels, coffee etc. for only 2) I realize we could have called for more, but I was clear when I booked it, there were 4 of us. I just expected more from a Hyatt.",Positive,,,,,
I just wish the bathrooms were a bit larger. Iâ€™d gladly sacrifice room in the bedroom or living room for a slightly larger bathroom.,Positive,,,,,
Excellent,Positive,,,,,
"Asked about river room didnâ€™t get it
Ordered prime rib and mashed potatoes....could not cut the meat potatoes were not mashed and undercooked 
Very difficult to find sign on road had a tree covering and no sign on building 
Also the amount of alcohol my husband ordered straight up was ridiculous...had to be less than a shot never saw anything like it",Negative,,,,,
food in restaurant on Monday night was not good.  I had a sandwich with meet and could not bite through it!!  Had to pull it out and then I ate what was left of the sandwich.,Positive,,,,,
The air conditioning didn't seem to really work and the wall mount was actually hanging off the wall partly. The elevators in this hotel are also some of the slowest I've ever seen in a hotel anywhere.,Negative,,,,,
"Very cold in room, but engineering brought up a heater.  No light bulb in desk lamp - engineering brought it up.  Blew a fuse between the hair dryer and heater and was getting ready for dinner. Fixed fairly quickly.  Good coffee in the room!",Positive,,,,,
"We were very satisfied! clean , nice little tv room, bar area with refrigerator, comfortable beds. And most of all clean! Service was great!",Positive,,,,,
"Many service failures occurred. My room had a soaked carpet from the sliding door left open. Despite being provided towels to try and soak up the carpet, no one followed up to see if the issue was resolved. The hotel was near capacity so could not move me to a room of a similar type. When I returned the next day the room smelled of mildew. While the person agreed to give me points back, the front desk agent told me no one had remarked my account. She agreed to give me 8,000 points back. I have yet to receive the points. I am disappointed with the service failures at this property and the lack of follow through during this visit.",Negative,,,,,
"Initially, we were put into a room that had not been cleaned. Both the bed and bathroom were still dirty.  I notified the front desk and they were very apologetic and immediately relocated us to a clean room.  This room was ready and was acceptable.  However when my wife went to make coffee the following morning, there was a scum forming on top of the water as though the coffee pot has not been recently cleaned.",Positive,,,,,
Our room was not clean.  There was garbage left in the cans; crumbs on the counter and chairs; the desk was full of crumbs around the perimeter and the chair looks like itâ€™s never been wiped clean.  We stayed during the Viking/Packer game and $500/night I was absolutely disgusted with the condition of the room.,Neutral,,,,,
Clean bathroom small you cant fix that but i was told i had 1 free breakfast then i didnt and poor quantity of beverages in room,Positive,,,,,
"Lack of parking spaces was frustrating.  Complementary breakfast, even if only a continental breakfast, would be appreciated.  Buffer breakfast was very good but surprised there was a pricey charge.  Hotel accommodations were excellent!",Positive,,,,,
"I was impressed with the room, everything was very nice. Impressive.  I thought food was a bit expensive, but that's to be expected I guess.  The only thing we had trouble with was getting out of the parking lot, the machine wouldn't take our voucher.",Positive,,,,,
"The quality of food and selection were disappointing,  We would still come back.",Negative,,,,,
Surprised at lack of facial tissue in the hotel rooms. Was that a mistake by the housekeeping department?,Negative,,,,,
The room was sufficiently clean but aged.  Bathroom amenities were so-so.  Shower could use updating.  Water pressure was poor and water took forever to heat up and then temp was difficult to control. Towels were rough and too small.,Neutral,,,,,
TV remote control in Room 630 did not always work properly,Positive,,,,,
Parking was a pain in the butt.,Negative,,,,,
Stormed and roof leaked.  Dripping noise during the night.,Negative,,,,,
"Our room on the 7th floor had water coming in under the sliding door, the carpeting was we about 1-2 feet from the door.  The breakfast buffet was not very good, our coffee was luke warm and tasted like stale cigarettes.  The food was adequate at best.  The service was also not very good they had a hard time explaining to them about the coffee they did not understand nor offer to bring fresh coffee.  We were only offered the buffet when I noticed that after we did get our food another customer ordered from a menu.",Positive,,,,,
wish pools hours for adults could be extended,Positive,,,,,
"Internet Access was really bad - even the ""High Speed"" Access that I paid for for 2 days. It was almost impossible to work in my room with the poor quality internet.",Negative,,,,,
"Front desk staff very professional and helpful.
I'd like to give a shout-out to housekeeping as I travel a lot and see a lot of misses but at Hyatt I have the feeling they have a white-glove test. To me, seems like the elite of housekeeping teams. Real professionals and helps the quality of life on the road! Thanks, Scott",Positive,,,,,
"The room next to ours had numerous loud people in the front of the room. But our bedroom was quiet and that was very impressive. Finally, a hotel that has superb sound insulation!!",Positive,,,,,
"Rooms need update old out of date very small toilet, manger not very accommodating when I need and extra hour to check out after my company spent a lot of money to hold an event only one day of complimentary water you guys a cheap. Food service was embarrassing  everyone complained. If I knew at the time there was another hotel near bye I would have stayed there.",Negative,,,,,
"The pet fee is ridiculous! I can see $20, bug not $100.00 for 1 night! We were never told this when we registered. That was a shock!",Negative,,,,,
Shower drain stopper was broke,Negative,,,,,
The put a gift of some nuts and beer in the room for when we arrived.  That was a very nice surprise!,Positive,,,,,
It is always a pleasure staying at the Hyatt in Green Bay,Positive,,,,,
"There were spider webs in the room.  Also, the air conditioner did not work good.",Positive,,,,,
"We were told a wheelchair would be available for our guests but when requesting one, we were told they were stolen or broken the week prior.  Another one of our guests stated there was mold growing in their in room coffee maker",Positive,,,,,
"Hotel was hard to find...not very well lit up or Hyatt displayed. Entry gate too close to the road as well. Check in went well except for the keys did not work so had to go back to front desk. Rey the intern was very good, helpful and cordial. Road was very nice, no issues. Had drinks in the bar, the prices were reasonable but the bar staff was not exceptionally friendly. The TV's are small and none were above the bar which is weird. The bar itself was laid out kind of strange too, no TV's easily accessible from the booths. The place is very spacious, and people at the pool seemed like they were having a good time. Not real busy for a Friday night, price was right for the top of the line Hyatt hotel.",Positive,,,,,
Great hotel in convenient place,Positive,,,,,
"Staff was great. Hotel was clean, but badly needs refurbishing.",Positive,,,,,
"We enjoyed our overall stay and the staff was very helpful and responsive. However, the bathroom was extremely small and therefore very uncomfortable.",Positive,,,,,
Bar staff slow service.  Not what I have experienced in the past.,Positive,,,,,
Desk chain was broken and flipped over when sat in they took care of it right away and installed a new chair.,Positive,,,,,
"The room was nice and clean. The housekeeping staff were helpful, prompt, and friendly. We appreciated the friendliness of the front desk staff.  The only snafu was that our room was only a king bed suite instead of the two queen bed suite we had reserved. Housekeeping brought us a rollaway right away and we enjoyed our stay despite that setback.",Positive,,,,,
There was a bug crawling on my bed and my wife sat on someoneâ€™s toenails on the couch and  when I moved the ottoman they were all over the floor. Absolutely uncalled for,Positive,,,,,
Wedding parties too loud at late night hours.,Negative,,,,,
"Everything was great, the bed, the room and customer service",Positive,,,,,
One of the T.V in the Living area was not working properly was very dark the screen and we couldn`t adjust it. Was difficult to watch on that T.V,Positive,,,,,
Hot water in bath room way too hot,Positive,,,,,
How the heck do you adjust the room temperature?  We tried fooling with the thermostat but couldn;t get it to respond as we had expected for it to.,Negative,,,,,
"Bathroom in the suite could have been a little better... Seemed to be some poor craftsmanship. Also, I had left my wedding ring in our room and Nicole was great at locating it and calling me to let me know she had found it. However, when I came to the front desk to pick it up there was a new woman behind the computer and when I said ""I'm here to pick up my ring"" she gave me a concerned look and shook her head slightly as if she knew nothing about it which I didn't expect her to. But the minute I said I was working with Nicole she made a call. For me to have already gone through the steps to find it and be relived and then for her to automatically assume that nothing has been turned in before looking was a little disappointing. I almost went into freak out mode all over again. Something that sentimental should have been handled more professionally from the second employee. But again, Nicole was amazing!",Positive,,,,,
"Charging $7 a night for parking is outrageous. I wouldn't have booked the room had I known I was going to be required to pay that. However, your website doesn't seem to mention it, or maybe that fact is purposefully hidden in some dark and inaccessible corner of the site. That's likely the case as much of what I read on the website was inaccurate and/or out of date. For example, I would have gladly paid extra upon booking my room for breakfast, had I known the breakfast consisted of more than what the website indicated. Basically, what I'm left with is the notion you don't care enough about your customers to provide them with the basic information they need to know to make informed decisions about booking rooms at your hotel. In my opinion, it's hard for business practice to be worse than that.",Negative,,,,,
Shower valve didn't work well initially but was promptly fixed when we notified the front desk.,Positive,,,,,
I canâ€™t wait to go back! An absolute pleasant surprise how awesome Green Bay Hyatt was!,Positive,,,,,
"only a light bulb over the bed did not work, otherwise exceptional",Positive,,,,,
I was very disappointed that I was going to have to pay $13 for a breakfast buffet when they are included at every other Hyatt that I have stayed at. That is not cost effective at all if I had brought all 5 of my kids with us on this trip. I chose to eat somewhere else for breakfast for this very reason.,Positive,,,,,
"Staff was very helpful, room was nice, clean,  appreciated the kitchenette area.  The bathroom was somewhat small, no extra towel hook for second person's robe, etc.",Positive,,,,,
"Parking cost is too high. No parking even available on site Saturday night, so had to use off site parking. Super inconvenient when checking out Sunday morning.",Positive,,,,,
"The service during breakfast on 9/1 was poor. We had to ask for cups for juice, cups for coffee, more coffee, and the water, apple & orange juices were empty and no one bothered to refill them. All of this while multiple staff were standing around not doing anything. By the time we got cups & drinks were refilled & we sat down to eat, our food was cold.",Negative,,,,,
"Food response is because of breakfast served. It was no where stated it was cash breakfast so we figured it was continental. We found out after we ate and had a bill put on our table it was not in fact continental. Even a small sign somewhere up front would be nice so you at least expect it. Parking was a little bit of a hassle with getting a ticket verified. We thought we had done so but when we put the ticket in we had to pay $20 for parking, in the end it was our fault but if there is a way to make it easier it would be wonderful.",Positive,,,,,
"Disappointed that there aren't any amenities with this property. We stayed at this property before it was Hyatt and they always provided an evening reception with free drinks and appetizers and a full breakfast in the morning. For what we paid for the room we didn't get our money's worth. The rooms are outdated. They were clean, but definitely need updating.",Positive,,,,,
"Service at the restaurant was incredibly slow, but food was good.",Positive,,,,,
Great fun T check in for the game!,Positive,,,,,
Asked for a quiet room and was given a room next to parking lot. Was noisy due to resurfacing the lot. Occupancy of hotel appeared low so a different room should have been available..,Positive,,,,,
"The staff here is always friendly, even the cleaning staff made sure to wish me a nice day. This is the case every time I stay here. Phenomenal!",Positive,,,,,
your elevators suck when crowds are large you don't have enough and terribly slow and unreliable broke down the weekend we were there,Negative,,,,,
Living area of suite was dark and un-inviting.,Negative,,,,,

"Elevators poor.  Frequently not working, slow.",Negative,,,,,
"Very nice, thank you much.",Positive,,,,,
Food was good but drink prices are to high,Positive,,,,,
Great place to stay,Positive,,,,,
there was no parking and I was directed to a local garage where I had to pay vs free at the hotel. Plus I thought I should get free breakfast but did not.,Positive,,,,,
We had a very loud air conditioner and the bathroom did not work properly.  The bath tub was slow in draining and the second night backed up without us using the shower.  I called it in late and when we woke up the tub was still full of junk. We also notice that all the housekeeper did was make the bed that day and never took out our garbage.  They should of seen the bath tub holding water.,Positive,,,,,
"Hotel is tired. Needs a remodel. Decor is old, paint work worn on the trim in the room, shower inadequate, room overall reminds me of an old motel 6 rather than a Hyatt.  Hyatt house / place are nicer.",Positive,,,,,
"Mirror on back wall of room looked to be at one point hanging on the wall. Was sitting on the floor leaned against the wall. 
Time waiting for elevators was a little ridiculous.",Negative,,,,,
"The room did not seem as clean as it could have been. There was a hand print on the table that was never cleaned off. Also, the soap wrapper in the bathroom stuck to the dish. Additionally, when checking out it took multiple times to ask for a receipt for the hotel rooms. It is like the staff didn't understand what was being asked, or didn't know how to do it.",Positive,,,,,
Parking lot is too small.  A wedding at the hotel filled up all the spots Saturday night and overflow parking is a block away.,Negative,,,,,
The toilet in our room did not flushed properly. Did see a maintenance man as we were leaving and told him. The elevators could be a little faster to the floors had family members wait over 15 minutes and walked around to the other elevator to go down.,Positive,,,,,
Not enough parking. I ended up two nights in a row having to use a parking ramp and getting charged $10.20 each day. I feel the hotel should have enough parking for its guests or parking costs should be reimbursed.,Negative,,,,,
One elevator broke so it was a long wait on Sunday morning.,Negative,,,,,
We have stayed here several times over the years and or disappointed. There was a very rowdy conference happening and essentially a tailgate block party occurred every night outside of the rooms. Because of the layout and openness of the hotel it was impossible to sleep! The front Desk staff finally did something about it but only after numerous calls,Negative,,,,,
"My son got married there. It was a wonderful weekend. Gave a lower score for customer service as I called ahead and asked if there was a wheelchair available for my elderly mother.  The person who answered the call said there was a wheelchair and she would inform the mgr. that we needed it. On the day of the wedding I went down to the desk and was told that the wheelchair was only for emergencies and we were not able to use it. Unfortunately it caused a lot of stress for my family that was in attendance as they needed to search for a wheelchair. Other than that, our stay was acceptable.",Positive,,,,,
"We stayed in a room that didn't have coffee or a bathroom ventilation fan. My wife took a shower, I took a shower and I could see to shave. I expect and get those at Motel 6, I would have expected them in a $170 room.",Positive,,,,,
Elevators are slow.,Negative,,,,,
The bathtub and bathroom sink drains both need repair. The housekeeping staff did a truly exceptional job.,Positive,,,,,
I enjoyed the stay  even though we didn't get much time. I had to get on the train very early in the morning. Your hospitality was great and my granddaughters enjoyed the pool. Thank you!,Positive,,,,,

Staff very accommodating with last-minute room upgrade. [A light would be nice between the bedroom & bathroom.],Positive,,,,,
"Bathtub drain mostly clogged. One nightstand lamp worked intermittently. Iron worked marginally, as it leaked water. Hotel is definitely showing it's age. Validated parking ticket didn't work one day during exit. Breakfast was good. Bed was comfortable. TV options plentiful. Liquor selection at bar was good.",Positive,,,,,
Would like to see ethnic Bollywood dances in the lobby as shows Bollywood music is very popular,Positive,,,,,
The phones in the room do not work. But that is a minor thing. We received an upgrade and was blown away at our room. Thank you so much,Positive,,,,,
"- cost  initially appeared it would be about 120 per night but in the end cost us over 163/ night  which is pretty expensive without including any breakfast which is why we wonâ€™t be back. Also the toilet needed servicing 
-  The gated parking was annoying to deal with each time we came and went",Positive,,,,,
"When I made the reservation I specifically said that I would have a pet, never once was an additional fee mentioned.  What a shock when I registered that there would be a $100 charge.  Also, while walking from the pool a little after 10 pm, my kids were strictly reminded of the quiet hours.  Mind you, they were not being loud.  Come 12 am, our whole room was woken up with loud shouting, singing and pounding from people running through the halls.  This continued for the next hour or so.  Never did I hear anyone warning them about being quiet.  Will I come back to this hotel, probably not.  Will I recommend it, probably not.",Negative,,,,,
You could afford putting some coffee in the lobby in the morning!   Vice charging your customers for everything that other chains incorporate into their overall customer service strategy.,Positive,,,,,
"The food in the groceries area was very very expensive, i'll know to bring my own next time......$7.00 for a small bag of Snickers is just wrong.....i know you need to make a profit and iam paying for the convenience but  I was with friends and family and was too embarrassed to give them right back and say forget it....The Hotel was sooooo beautiful and the staff very polite, so we will return in the future, but will bring our own snacks..THANK YOU!!!!",Positive,,,,,
"The room wasn't dirty--bed was very clean, no bed bugs (which really is all I ultimately care about)--but it was obvious the corners, under the bed, behind the headboard, in the closet, etc. had not been vacuum/dusted in years.",Positive,,,,,
"Not a huge issue, but the TV channels printed on the card did not match the actual channels on TV.",Positive,,,,,
Great service.  Our room was missing the hair dryer.  We called the front desk and one was delivered quickly.,Neutral,,,,,
We only had 1 problem. We were there with a group for a wedding and we weren't told at check-in that breakfast was complimentary so paid for it for 1 day. We were charged for breakfast a 2nd day and we didn't eat there so I called when I got home and it was straightened out but it was a pain to have to do.,Positive,,,,,
We were told by one staff member the breakfast was complimentary and it wasnâ€™t. Surprise!!!,Positive,,,,,
Only issue we had was the hotel parking lot was full. But we were directed to free parking nearby.,Positive,,,,,
Tried to downgrade my room,Negative,,,,,
"Weeks prior to my arrival, I informed Hyatt personnel that I would be traveling with a small dog- I also asked for a quiet room, I am sad to say, I was in the 6th floor and right in the middle of the floor - not convenient to take a dog in and out for breaks ðŸ˜ª also had to tell the desk personnel that the doggie waste basket outside was overflowing- and a drunk party guest tossed a whole bunch of garage in the bushes there! We were vigilant in cleaning up after our pet- but very obvious others did not- maybe because the waste bin was overflowing ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸",Positive,,,,,
I thought the elevators were very slow,Negative,,,,,
"Restaurant staff all seemed very new and not knowing what was going on.  Friends bought rounds of drinks for our group, they were charged and the others charged also.  Food at wedding reception we were at was ok and not as hot as it could have been.  Drinks were way over priced for banquet drinks...$4 for water...seriously? We werenâ€™t downtown Chicago.",Positive,,,,,
The rooms were awesome. Kiel and kara were great bartenders at the wedding reception. So friendly and prompt!,Positive,,,,,
"The hotel was clean but was older carpet, toliet, tub, etc.
Hotel cleaning lady was very nice to me and gave me extra coffee!",Positive,,,,,
"It was so noisy at night could not sleep until around 4 :00 AM until all the party people went to sleep surprised someone on staff didnâ€™t ask them to hold it down ! Especially for the cost of the

Everything was wonderful except the pull out  bed. The springs were poking out an it was uncomfortable.,Neutral,,,,,
Market options are great and so is the staff.,Positive,,,,,
Air conditioning did not work very well in the room at all.  I had it set to 55 degrees but the room never got below 73 degrees.  I complained twice and finally a fan was brought to the room but the A/C never got any better.,Positive,,,,,
"There was mold growing in the air vents in the room.  I could not stop sneezing unless the air was off.  Charging 5 times the price for over the counter medications is absurd.  Really,  2 or 3 extra dollars on a package of pepto... How petty is that.  You should be willing to take care of your customers that your are making money on the stay of the visit and food spent... that is where you are making your money not by taking advantage of your customer by making a rare extr 2 dollars on pepto.  I'd never stay at the Hyatt again.  Im a member.  I typically stay at country inn whcih is suppose to be of lesser quality but it is superior to the Hyatt.  Im so disappointed with the Hyatt im considering not ever staying with any affiliate of the Hyatt in Greenbay.",Positive,,,,,
"Parking is super awkward and I had to pay 7 bucks for the privilege. That's my main gripe. Otherwise, very good customer service especially from the breakfast staff when discussing my daughter's allergy. That was much appreciated and makes me likely to stay there again despite really not liking the parking situation.",Positive,,,,,
"1- The service at the restaurant was very poor. Long wait both nights with a not full place. One night they had Malbec, the second night the waiter did not even know what a Malbec was.  The quality of the food was good. The Saturday night the kitchen closed without a heads-up and we could not have dessert. 
2- The parking lot was full and we had to park outside of the property. 
3- A portion of the room carpet in my room felt wet the first night. 
4- Front desk employees were nice. 
5- Breakfast was good.",Positive,,,,,
Staff was awesome,Positive,,,,,

Over all it was good.",Positive,,,,,
Beautiful room. VERY comfy bed! Good layout. Not enough luggage carts and staff had no idea how to help.  Very happy with Hyatt,Positive,,,,,
"Had stopped at the front desk to complain about three things. My room #707 had a refrigerator that didn't quite fit in the opening. The wood frame around it was broke. The door was sprung and did not close properly. For me to close it each time, I had to try and slide the unit towards the frame to keep it shut. The clerk told me, we're really sorry about that. Seemed she didn't take my complaint seriously. (Nor the food I had to toss out when I first discovered the problem the first morning of my stay.

Secondly, there were 4-6 inch brown hairs in the wall and ceiling inside the shower/bathtub in my room. 

Third, used the spare blanket that was in the closet container. That to, had some brown hairs on it and also a 3x2 inch pink cool aide type stain on it. 

When I stopped down and complained, the clerk gave me what appeared to be a sad sincere smile, and said, Oh I'm so sorry. Then continued with her other duties. Made me wonder if she understood what I was explaining to her or if that was just the standard response to avoid and problems.

None of my complaints were addressed and I was disappointed on the care of my room and lack of any corrective action. I usually always enjoy staying at the Hyatt and was there for four days, three night attending the WI Chief's of Police Conference. I put up with the problems because I had an expectation that they would be corrected, unfortunately they were not. The conference and facility were great and the evening restaurant/tavern lounge we're excellent.  Just wish I could say the same thing about my room.",Negative,,,,,
"The breakfast buffet is the best in the Green Bay area. Also, Colton and Gennadiy were among the very helpful and considerate staff. I will be back again.",Positive,,,,,
"When we got to our room, the room looked nice at first glance. We pulled back the sheets to get in to bed and it was as if the sheets hadnâ€™t been changed. Full of hair. Called front desk. Maid dropped sheets off and we had to change them.",Positive,,,,,
I walked into the Hyatt from out of town and exhausted from being with my mom who was hospitalized at the hospital there in Green Bay.  I needed a room and Jacob was very gracious to give me a room and even gave me a â€œhospital discountâ€.  He was very kind and made me feel at ease being from Minnesota in packer land.ðŸ˜Š. My car was safe!  Thank you!  I will recommend the Hyatt to others.,Positive,,,,,
Slow elevators,Negative,,,,,
"Excellent !  Carie and Deanna were great to work with!!! My wife and I felt they went above and beyond their duties. Houskeeping Staff were friendly and courteous! Enjoyed and Pub and staff, great place to gather with family. Nice that it was pet friendly too. Location is great near nightclubs and restaurants!",Positive,,,,,
"We got a knock on the door late in the night and we were asked if we were smoking in the room because they smelled the odor. When we got back to our room from getting our pizza, we also smelled a smoke smell in he hallway but for the hotel employees to insist that we were smoking even though we had 2 small children in the room is beyond me!! I am very upset with our stay!",Negative,,,,,
I would say as with most HYATT when a group is present in the hotel as was the case here! They forget who their regular customers are. Hilton and Marriott are the same. But it would be nice for the staff to look a head several days when a group is there and plan better on giving regular guests their favorite room type and location.,Positive,,,,,
Room cleanliness was disgusting.,Negative,,,,,
"All my breakfasts were cold. Large amounts of the food selected were in the warming trays, but eggs, bacon, sausage gravy were consistently cold everyday. The only exception was the omelette bar. Service and food was EXCELLENT! Other than that, I thoroughly enjoy staying at HR.",Positive,,,,,

Luckily a room was available for one night , we had tickets to packers game , but unfortunately due to hotel mistake, I have to go to Appleton Wisconsin, due to all hotels booked .",Positive,,,,,

It was a great stay!! It would be nice to have breakfast sty open a bit later and more options for hot snack food later at night (after 10:00 pm).,Positive,,,,,
I really liked the large room and everything worked well. I was concerned that the carpet in room was ridged up in a few places in bedroom area and this is a trip hazard especially in low lighting conditions. I think I was in room 214 or 215.,Positive,,,,,
Long check in lines while employees stood around rather than behind the desk helping people check in,Positive,,,,,
Great experience although the decor looks a little tired and beginning to wear out. I would definitely stay there again!,Positive,,,,,
The AC didn't work and it took 20minutes for someone to answer the phone at 1am.,Positive,,,,,
Profile requests were not mentioned. Feather free room,Positive,,,,,
"Breakfast was fine, dinner definitely needs improvement.  Vegetables undercooked.  Potatoes wet and pasty.  Meat such as pork which is on the dryer side routinely could have used a gravy choice.",Positive,,,,,
"The sink did not drain well in the room.  Even though we were designated gluten free there were limited options at the hotel and nothing was labeled vegan, gluten free etc.  This is common practice at other hotels including the Hyatt Regency.",Positive,,,,,
"Overall the hotel was generally clean with a comfortable room. The issue I, along with several other guests who were there attending a conference had was that we were not able to check into our rooms at 3:00pm like your policy states. We were not able to check in until 5:30 pm. The reason that was given was because they hadn't been cleaned yet. It was apparent to me that since there was a professional football team staying in the hotel with us that their rooms got priority in being cleaned. Not sure why this had to happen. Management obviously knew that the hotel was booked with a football team along with our conference attendees why didn't they bring in extra cleaning personnel? 

The second issue I had was when on Tuesday evening i went down to the bar with several of my fellow conference attendees and waited for over ten minutes to get a drink. There were three bartenders on the bar was maybe half full and we were never even acknowledged. We eventually went to a different establishment to get served. Very disappointed in this Hyatt's service.",Positive,,,,,
Pub food not very good and waaaay over priced.,Positive,,,,,
Mold in the bathroom set off my allergies,Negative,,,,,
Justine at the front desk as well as the manager were very helpfully and friendly. The security guard who was working Friday August 2nd around 7:30 went out of his way to help me and was friendly and professional.,Positive,,,,,

"Front Desk never mentioned me as a rewards member, nothing offered about hotel, restaurants, food service times where breakfast was offered... Television was difficult to turn-on and navigate in room and bed lamps didn't work.  Took one and a half hours and two calls to the front desk to get a technician to the room to fix tv and lamp.  I mean it was a nice hotel but staff needed some training on Customer Service.",Positive,,,,,
"The check in process was the most trying experience I've had at a hotel.  In my opinion, it was due to the personnel working the desk, but rather it was likely based on management decisions to provide preferential treatment to one large group of guests over the large group of guests I was associated with.  My room was finally ready 1.5 hours after check-in time.  This was the experience had by many others in my group.",Positive,,,,,
"We have been coming to this hotel for 30 years, this is the first time it did not exceed our expectations.  We tried to check-in 2 hours after the advertised check-in time and were told our room was not available.  When a room did become available, it was not the room we reserved.  The pull out bed was extremely uncomfortable.  Very disappointing that absolutely no explanation was given as to why the room wasn't ready and no attempt to adjust our bill for the change in room.",Positive,,,,,
Admittedly frustrated with the check-in process. I had a booked my room months in advance and received an early check-in email but upon arrival was told my room was not ready. Waited several hours before it was only to be placed in a room with two beds instead of the king bed I had reserved. Front desk staff was exceptional (as always!) and found me the correct room. I also received a nice card from the manager but I was surprised to have any of this happen as I have never had a bad experience with check-in or room issues in the past. Again - note that your staff was awesome.,Positive,,,,,
Justine was also pleasant to work with when checking out.,Positive,,,,,
"Staff was helpful, polite, and professional. nice accommodations.",Positive,,,,,
"The king bed room was excellent and the best room I have ever had at this location.  All of your staff were very friendly and went out of their way to greet me, smile, and ask if I needed anything, no matter where I was in the hotel.  Your breakfast buffet was outstanding, as always!  Receiving this at no cost made this even better.  This stay was the best experience ever at this location and I look forward to booking again next year for the Chief's Conference.  THANKS!",Positive,,,,,

I was informed after my 2nd night, only two night were reserved by staff and there was no occupancy for me on the 3rd night and final night.

Hopefully, the next visit will be better or I will be finding a different hotel to stay at.",Positive,,,,,

WOW! Hidden prices unaware...no idea. Happy with atmosphere for show and feel....felt ripped off. More communication for overall experience and prices..beyond room. Hotel looks amazing. Stay felt draining.",Positive,,,,,
"When I checked in I was never told to validate my parking ticket. My reservation was suppose to be points and somehow I was charged. I found this out when I noticed a charge on my credit card. I wen to the front desk to get this taken care of and after wasting 30 minutes was told they could t help me a that I needed to call â€œWorld of Hyattâ€.
I had just spent the entire day in the hospital for my son so I called the next morning. I called World if Hyatt, the next morning and they told me to have the hotel call them to issue rewards for my stay.
That was another 15 minutes. I then called one of the hotel managers to help me with this. She wasnâ€™t very friendly but did however take care of the point vs charge for my stay.
From a housekeeping stand; 
The paper towels in my room were nasty. Stained with something Grosse. I had asked the front desk the first time I saw them but was ignored. They didnâ€™t take care of this until I had to complain twice. This is unacceptable!
I also asked the front desk to see if house keeping could clean my balcony ( it had a ton of spider webs and spiders). Their response was â€œOh the balconies are not to be stood on. I mean nothing has happened yet but you shouldnâ€™t use itâ€
My response: 
This should have been mentioned when I made the reservation or at least at check in.
I am so disappointed in Hyatt, Green Bay!",Positive,,,,,

We always stay at the Hyatt in greenbay.   We ended up in a corner room  and it wasnâ€™t as nice as the other rooms.  And the patio door had all kinds of kids finger prints  on them the bed had some thing from the last person under it.  And the elevator. The glass was the same way. I have never complained before but when you pay 170.00 plus a night you would think it would be cleaner and in the past I have never seen it this dirty. Like I said I never complained before.  And  are breakfast was very cold this time also a little girl was putting her hair in the butter and playing in it. I was not a happy camper this time.,Positive,,,,,

Our room had a bulge on the carpeting and was not fixed during iur stay; our room key kept malfunctioning - I had to make several trips to concierge.

They were happy to just kept changing the keys - much to my inconvenience.,Positive,,,,,

"I rated the bathroom as not being cleaned but it was for the most part except the fact that the last person's used and wet washcloth was left in my shower.  On the second day, I was left with no floormat nor any washclothes.  Finally, they are not properly staffed for busy check-in or check-out times.  Each time, there was only one person who could help any of us.  A gentleman wearting a manager name tag was just standing at a work station unable to help anyone needing to check out.  What?  Why is he a manager if he cannot check people out and instead stands there as we are left to stand in line waiting for the one lady who apparently could check people out.  They looked ridiculous and that was my final image of their service.",Positive,,,,,
"We worked hard all day long and I wanted to get my room to a temperature of 66 degrees.  I called the front desk and spoke to numerous people and finally on our last night it got close to that temperature.  That was very disappointing.  That was really my only complaint, but it was a pretty big complaint since it was difficult to sleep.",Negative,,,,,

When I went to the front desk early the next morning to pay the $15, I was told that I could not get late check out even though I was told the night before that it was available. The front desk agent was not interested in being able to assist with my request as she told me that they needed the rooms.",Positive,,,,,
"I asked for the fridge to be looked at and then swapped out the next day because it was not working consistently and it was not fixed or changed out.

"It was wonderful, thank youðŸ˜Ž",Positive,,,,,
Staff was very courteous  and Security Officer's was very professional. Felt really safe staying here.,Positive,,,,,
"The food service the 2 mornings seemed a bit confusing - we did not have a definite server and asked a couple of times for refill on coffee and no one helped.  
I was actually a bit disappointed in our stay this time - it seems as if Hyatt employees though very professional are losing their friendliness and welcoming ways.  It feels like a corporation when you enter the doors.  I actually was a bit intimidated to ask a couple of questions.
This is an example that we witnessed during our stay - there was a young family - the father broke his foot the day before and was walking with crutches.  He had a toddler holding on to one of the crutches with him - the mother was pushing a stroller trying to get another toddler to hold on to the side and she was holding an infant.  No one on the Hyatt Staff asked them if they needed help to their car or even looked their way as the toddler was crying.  We helped them maneuver the parking lot.  The next morning when they were down at breakfast my husband and I helped the mom with her 3 children at the buffet.  When we were checking out we had to tell the front desk to please help them when there would be checking out.  I was really disappointed that your staff is very professional - almost to intimidation - that they have lost kindness.
On the other hand - I did have a good experience making the reservation with Emma and also adding another evening on with Katie.  Both were very helpful.",Positive,,,,,
"I found a wad of used dental floss on the floor of my room when I checked in and the fridge in 726 makes a buzzing noise unless you wedge it in the area ""just right"".  Also, when I went to leave, my validated ticket was being rejected. After backing out, running back inside and being told, ""try it again... if that doesn't work, grab another ticket, come back in and we'll validate that one"", I was a little miffed.

"Had ADA King room with roll in shower.  Need to replace the permanent toilet bar on outside with a wall mount lift up and down unit.  Some wheelchair people need to transfer onto the toilet from the side. The entry door should operate with automatic wall buttons.  Location of ADA rooms should be on ground floor or floor with access to sky walk so wheelchair bound people can get out of building in case of fire and elevators cannot be used.  Door entries should be straight entry for the wheelchairs, as turning and trying to open the door at same time is nearly impossible unless there is an auto door opening.",Negative,,,,,
"Bartender on Sunday evening, while friendly, didn't appear to feel comfortable in her job; bartenders Tuesday evening were great; staff at breakfast didn't come around with coffee or ask if anyone needed anything; waiters just took plates without asking if you were finished; breakfast ticket handling was very confusing; and there were repeated issues with the parking passes.  So while the hotel was very nice, and people were friendly, the service side was lacking. Overall, the service was lackluster from past trips to this location.",Positive,,,,,

"My room was only half cleaned after my first night. Either clean it or dont!!!!! Pillows all over, comforter wadded in a ball and thrown on bed. Looked like someone left for a minute and did not come back",Positive,,,,,
"Whenever my husband and I come to Green Bay we always stay at the Hyatt on Main. Every room is a suite with a bar and lounge area right as you walk in and the bedroom is at the back which is great because your beds are not right up against the door where there will be walking traffic going by the door. The room is very comfortable and the buffet breakfast held in the 1st floor commons area is wonderful. They offer Steel Cut Oatmeal, Scrambled Eggs, bacon, muffins, fresh fruit, toast, bagels and fresh pastries. On the weekends there is an omelette station & you are able to go back for seconds if you so desire. There is a wonderful pool and hot tub just off this main area on 1st floor and they are both wonderful. The water in the pool isn't too cold like in many pools and there is ample room to swim. In addition there is a PUB in the 1st floor lobby area that serves lunch and dinner as well as having a bar. Their food is very good. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone as it is a comfortable stay and the people that work there are very accommodating.",Positive,,,,,
"The hotel was not full the night of my stay.  I was assigned a room on the 8th floor, far from elevators, next to an exit stairwell.  Felt like I was in a far away dungeon.  It appeared there were many, many unrented rooms yet a couple with very noisy children was in the room right next to mine.  It also connected so the noise seemed extra noise with only that wooden door between us.  Please give more consideration to room assignments.  It pretty much sucked.",Positive,,,,,
"We had a nice stay. the only issue was in room, for some reason housekeeping would not replace the disposable cups. After the first morning, left the dirty coffee cups on the counter and no new ones were given. The 2nd time, only 1 cup was replaced but not the coffee! and the disposable water cups were not replaced. and the final day, cups replaced but not the lids! Also had an issue with towels not  being replaced as used. 2 bath, 2 hand, 2 wash clothes, 1 bath mat became 2 bath, 1 hand, 3 wash clothes and 2 bathmats by our last day with other variations on the other days.  on a personal preference, not everyone likes starbucks coffee, would have been nice to have an alternative.",Positive,,,,,
The parking tickets are a bit confusing at first along with getting a bill for breakfast. Even though they take it off in the end it would make more sense to give out vouchers when they are included in on your stay. Also my service for breakfast was horrible. Didnâ€™t get drinks till almost done and then my coffee cup had lipstick on it from the person before.,Negative,,,,,
"When we checked into our 2 rooms, the first room the door was open and we went in and the room had not been cleaned, so we proceeded to the 2nd room, which was occupied and the keys did not work. We had requested rooms close to each other, so our kids might be able to sleep in their own room, but after we got this straightened out our rooms were on different floors. We have stayed at this property before ad had no complaints, but this time was much different.",Negative,,,,,
No towel racks in bathroom. Therefore reuse of towels not encouraged. Double room but only one bathrobe. Neither of us used it.,Positive,,,,,
"My low marks are a result of our car getting hit in the parking lot (rented mini van).  Also, the breakfast was a disaster from basically no food due to a insurance convention at which all of the people seemed to be overeating...so I think it was impossible for the Hyatt to keep up with the demand.  Nonetheless, when our family tried to eat, there was not alot of food left and the food was cold. The parking lot accident was a result of the night security guard telling us to park in an end slot...which wasnt actually a parking space...but he directed us to that spot.  In all fairness, though, whomever hit our car was totally at fault.  Also, it was a hit and run.  No note left. Morning security guard was excellent as were the GB Police when we filed the report.",Negative,,,,,
Had to order coffee 3X before he remembered to bring it and by then it was too late.  I had to go order it from the cafe/store up front.,Negative,,,,,
"Charge of $7 to park in hotel lot; that was unexpected considering what the rate for our stay is. The parking should be complimentary. No other hotel charges a parking fee in Green Bay.
Coffee maker did not work. Called front desk for a replacement. Took 1/2 hour to get a replacement coffee maker to our room. By that time it was too late.",Negative,,,,,
"I called the morning I was checking in to double check the pricing and everything was fine. At check in hours later I was told they over booked the type of room I had reserved. Iâ€™m still unsure of why someone else got that room and I did not as I work in the hospitality industry myself. I was merely satisfied with the money taken off, and ridiculous parking fees waived, (I mean seriously who charges people who are staying at their hotel to park?) and the breakfast buffet was comped as well. But still have never understood overbooking a room style, staff should know hotel and computer operating systems for Hyatt cooperation should really be top notch. 

To the guest room. We stayed in a double queen suite and was mildly clean, living area tables were dusty and comforter for couch bed had stains on it. In the fridge was a corona in the freezer from what I would guess to be the guest before us. Every mirror was foggy, streaky, or had toothpaste spit on the bottom. They obviously did not vacuum. 4 bath towels, 2 hand towels, and 1 wash cloth was the towel amenities in our guest room. Shower curtain had orange stain on it. Toilet bowl was dirty as well. 
Restaurant was fun! Bartender was nice and had good drinks and the food was amazing tasting and great portions. Servers were a little inexperienced. But nice. 
My family also loved the oversized toys, games of checkers, connect 4, uno. And my family had a good time. We loved the window elevator.",Positive,,,,,

"I travel often and stay at Hampton Inn.  My boys and I took this vacation together and decided to try the Hyatt in Green Bay since others in the area were sold out or too expensive due to the Oskosh Air Show.  One thing that instantly turns me off to a hotel is hair - not mine since I am bald and just walked into the room.  Black hair on one of the beds.  I washed my face and dried off with a bath towel and got a long brown hair on my face from the towel.  Also, a few pieces of black hair in the tub at arrival. I looked up and saw a few long hairs stuck to the bathroom ceiling where it had been wiped down.  Sorry to say, but this is enough for me to not stay at the Hyatt again.  One other thingâ€“â€“charged $7 a night for parking in the front lot.  The third night there were no spaces and was told to park in the parking garage that was close...since ""they didn't charge overnight"".  Wondering if there was no charge, why the Hyatt charged me $7 for not parking in their lot?",Negative,,,,,

"From checking in on Day 1 and our entire 12 day stay Noely was the utmost professional and provided superior Customer Service.  Not to be outdone was Katie in providing the best service and being very cordial.  They both made my son and I feel comfortable and welcomed as a guest, not just another customer.  From giving us ideas on places to go for fun or to eat, to just greeting us with a smile and speaking on the many times we entered and exited... they made this the most memorable stay at a hotel we have ever experienced.   My son already misses the hotel.  This will be our hotel of choice whenever we are in Green Bay.

Also, I think her name is Alora or Aloha with the Hospitality crew.  She made sure our room was always clean and we had what we needed everyday.

It did not say it was $13.  We were surprised with the bill.  We would gotten the bowl of oatmeal elsewhere, for less than $13.",Positive,,,,,
Great place to stay with friendly staff!,Positive,,,,,
I booked a king bed along with some of my relatives months ago and when we checked in after 3:00 there weren't any rooms with a king bed available even though we booked in advance. We were there for my brothers wedding and one of the bars in the reception area had warm beer that was mostly foam and several people told the bar tender but she didnt seem to care or do anything about it. Very frustrating conciderating how much it costs for a wedding package.,Positive,,,,,

"Online check in was great. Air conditioning would not go lower than 69 but staff brought me a fan which was great. We were there for a convention, I think more front desk staff was needed. Also, the bathroom vent was completely covered in dust and the drapes were torn and hanging off the track. However, the balance of the room was very nice. Great room for convention & visiting with delegates. Overall the staff was very accommodating.",Positive,,,,,
Did not like that we had to pay for outdoor parking at hotel,Positive,,,,,
"We showed up to check into our room one hour after the three pm check in and the room was not ready and they told us that we would have to wait at least another hour to check in. The big issue is that we had a wedding starting in the KI at 4:30 so we had to get going to the wedding. At no point did they offer to store our belongings, or even offer to change rooms to one that would better suit our check in needs. I am very disappointed in the fact that they were worked about their needs and not mine at all.",Positive,,,,,
"One of the receptionists answering the phones the night of my arrival was rude and careless. I felt she was annoyed by my questions (breakfast and pool times) and requests (stollaway bed which I had requested at the time of booking, but was never sent to my room, and a request for late check-out which she said they donâ€™t have available with a bad attitude). She wasnâ€™t helpful, but her attitude was what spoiled my stay. I waited until the next day to ask another receptionist for late check out again, and she was happy to give us late check out without a problem.

I have stayed at this hotel several times before, but had never encountered such a rude receptionist there. The rest of the staff were polite. I wouldâ€™ve given this hotel 4 stars, but due to the bad customer service from the rude receptionist I would hardly give it 3 stars.",Negative,,,,,

"The hotel itself was fine. The front desk staff was exceptional, very helpful and knowledgeable. 
The restaurant manager on the other hand.... 
He knew we had seated ourselves and seemingly was standing around with the bar staff. Our waitress was clearly new, she came over apologizing about our wait (we had to get our own menus from the bar). She took our drink order answered our questions, and then retuned with our drinks to take our food order. After a 30-40 minute wait in a not busy restaurant we got our food. After we got our food one of the sides was wrong. The waitress did not check on us for awhile, so we approached the bar to find out the person standing behind the bar, was the manager. We let him know that there was an issue with the order. Our waitress came out and told us it would be a few minutes until our order was out.... another 20 minutes go by. No manager has checked on us, and we still donâ€™t have our side of sweet potato fries. We approached the bar to inquire, and let them know at this point we shouldnâ€™t be paying for the sandwich this was ridiculously slow service. 
Once we got the food and the bill, the manager again was no where to be found. After 20 minutes of waiting to find the manger who was â€œin a different departmentâ€, I went to the front desk to have him paged. We tried explaining to him the ridiculousness of this whole situation. He then decided he should blame his wait staff for not relaying the message that the sandwich would be free to us. 
We ended up arguing to have the full bill taken care of. Had this manager come out to the table apologized for the mistake, checked on us or our food, there would have been no issue. Mistakes happen. But to then blame it on the wait staff for not relaying his message. That was absurd. There was no apology no customer service from the manager just blame placed on his staff. Unacceptable. That put a bitterness on our entire stay. The breakfast was excellent and the service from the staff was great.",Positive,,,,,
More USB ports in the room would be nice to have!!,Positive,,,,,
Super helpful employees - got us tooth brushes and toothpaste when we forgot ours.,Positive,,,,,
"The things that were annoying include the slow elevator and not have an access door to the ground floor from the staircase.  There probably are ""security"" reasons, however, I wanted to use the stairs to get to the ground floor and that wasn't an option.

I'd like to thank the maintenance crew for repairing the hot tub in such a short time.  Friday night the hot tub water was lowering quickly and all of a sudden the water was splashing everywhere.  Mainenance was there quickly and fixed it instead of closing it (as other hotels would have done).  I was able to enjoy the hot tub once again on Saturday morning, prior to checkout. 

It was awesome to be able to check into my room at 12:30 rather than 3:00.  This greatly helped me organize the day since I had tasks to be part of all afternoon and evening with our convention that was there.  

I totally enjoyed all of the food for breakfast and for our evening meal.  In my opinion, the food was prepared wonderfully and served hot enough to enjoy.  The buffet table on Wednesday and Thursday were kept stocked that even those of us that couldn't get there until way after it opened were able to have hot fresh food.  Saturday's banquet was great.  I even enjoyed the vegetables.",Positive,,,,,

"Banquet on the last night was suppose to be pork with Sauerkraut and dumplings. Sauerkraut was pretty much missing at the table I was sitting at. Others I spoke to also made the same comment.

Everyone is always wonderful at this hotel!,Positive,,,,,
"My room could have used an upholstered chair and reading  lamp in a very empty corner of the room.  It was difficult to move the desk cair between the bed to watch TV.

I was really disappointed that the breakfast was not included with our room as it had been in the past. The woman I checked in told me that just because Iâ€™m a Hyatt member I donâ€™t automatically get breakfast. When checking out I had a different woman explain that if I had registered through them I would have been offered 2 breakfasts for only $7.00 more!! I ordered our room through the Hyatt website! Breakfast was an additional $30.00. The second woman told me to next time call and ask for the room that includes breakfast. So now I know!!!,Positive,,,,,
Fitted sheets that fit the mattress would be nice.  They constantly slip off of the corners and that is frustrating.,Positive,,,,,
"Hotel is so old and in need of a huge investment.  Elevator moves way, way, way too slow. I had a terrible time at breakfast.  Normal waitress was busy looking over a convention and substitute waitress, although friendly kept making mistakes just as the kitchen did.",Positive,,,,,
There was an additional charge to my account after I paid my bill for approximately 14$ . I do no understand why I was charged this amount . We did not damage anything in the room .,Negative,,,,,
I still am waiting for feedback on my extra room charges,Positive,,,,,
There was one lady that I would ask questions and she was pretty rude. She was always really short with me and never explained things to me.

One of the bed sheet was not clean it had dry blood stains and specks of dirt. House keeping provide a change of linen after a 40 minute wait.,Negative,,,,,
"Between the workers being extremely helpful, and the room being clean and pleasant to stay in, I have no doubts about future stays. Even with my early check-in the room was cleaned and ready for me and my friends; and the rollaway cart was brought in within a reasonable amount of time considering we arrived earlier then I was expecting.

3)Breakfast was good overall, sausages under done or not browned, pastries very delightful. Nice selection of beverage choices. Staff was excellent!
After reviewing my statements above I must say bravo and thank you for hiring wonderful people, they make all the difference.",Positive,,,,,
"Check in was super simple and every person on staff that we encountered with weekend was so kind and genuine and lovely. My only complaints are that there are not enough pictures of the the rooms online so you can judge what works for you before you get there, (as of today there is only one picture of the room type I booked on the website and it only shows half of the suite), it would help greatly if you included room layouts in the room photos so guests could see exactly what they are getting and make sure it is right for them. My other complaint was the food in the bar was incredibly pricey for very small portions, I believe I paid between $12-$15 for 3 chicken strips and some fries and that didn't even include a dipping sauce option.The food also took a very long time to come out but I do understand that that was probably because the kitchen was very busy with all the convention goers that were there that weekend. All in all I had a good stay, but a few tweaks could make a huge difference for next time.",Positive,,,,,
"I was there for Kitsune so obviously the hotel was fully booked. Still staff was polite and very fast. The rooms and hotel itself were very clean, especially for the volume of guests. I appreciate being able to have my room ready around my ETA and the email check in feature. Super easy process!",Positive,,,,,
"I did not know that standard rooms are suite-style and was very pleasantly surprised! The room was absolutely great! My only complaint was that I had to wait 40 minutes for a luggage cart, but that is more the fault of other guests. The staff did repeated searches for carts while I waited.",Negative,,,,,

"This was my third time staying at the Hyatt Regency in Green Bay.  I usually visit the Green Bay area 1-3 times a year.  Every other experience has been wonderful.  This last experience makes it unlikely that I will return.  The room I stayed in was not clean.  The bathroom fan had mold surrounding it, and there was mold around the toilet.  There were light red stains on one of the beds comforters and black curly hairs on one of the beds pillows.  Seeing the state of the room we went to the front desk and requested another room.  We were told that someone could go and clean the room because there were no other rooms in the hotel for us to switch to.  When we said we would just like a refund and would be leaving a room was then available.  The second room was fine and the rest of the stay was fine.  However having the first room in such rough condition, and having to go and plea for another room or leave put a damper on the evening. I also feel like it is crazy to charge $7 for parking when there is not an event going on.  The parking gate to leave was also up the entire time so anyone would have been able to come and go making the $7 charge pointless.  We did receive a coupon for a free item for in the Hyatt Marketplace and were able to switch rooms.  I am cautious/unlikely to return though based on how things went during my last visit.",Positive,,,,,
"The website advertised a fridge in the room, in reality it was a labeled a cooler that was barely cold enough to keep drinks chilled. There was an odd wet spot in the corner that didnâ€™t seem to dry up. The parking process and fees were not transparent in the booking process. Pictures on the website made the room look much much much larger than it actually was. One of the windows in the room. Weâ€™ve stayed at category 1 hyatt motels that in all honesty were a fair amount nice than this category 2 motel. Overall, we were pretty disappointed.",Positive,,,,,
"Parking is very poor.

Slow drain in the tub.,Negative,,,,,
The bar was really expensive for what we got. Breakfast was way overpriced for the food.,Positive,,,,,
"There was barely any air conditioning in the hotel, I did not have 1 single good nights sleep in 7 days. I was moved to a different room and had the same air conditioning issue as did several other people that were traveling with me, my room NEVER got below 69Â° and was humid. I was offered a fan which made it just barely cool enough for me to sleep. This is the second Hyatt property with this exact same issue, this is unacceptable. You are in the hospitality business, make your guests / customers comfortable!",Positive,,,,,
The customer service at this hotel was stellar! I recently reserved nine rooms for myself and 17 employees. We encountered several issues that the hotel staff quickly remedied to our complete satisfaction. I will actually look for opportunities to stay here in the future!,Positive,,,,,

We requested additional towels by leaving a note for the cleaning staff, but the request was ignored.  We also couldn't figure out why kleenex was not provided in the room.",Positive,,,,,
If there are available rooms earlier than check in time guests should be given the room.  They wanted to upcharge 7.00 to get into a room early.,Positive,,,,,
We did experience a loud disturbance outside our suite after midnight which included people knocking on our door. We had no lights on in our room as we were all sleeping. The grandkids happened to be in the front room sleeping and were frightened by the ordeal. Maybe Hyatt could have extra security for holidays.,Negative,,,,,
The guests in the next room were extremely loud using vulgar language until 4:00 a.m.  Got no sleep.  When we mentioned it to the front desk they merely apologized.,Positive,,,,,
The refrigerator did not get cold but they did send maintenance to fix it He was going to change it and bring in another one but I just offered to use the ice machine wasn't a big deal since I was only staying for 1 night,Neutral,,,,,

This is my third year, in a row, staying with you. I was looking forward to the breakfast buffet, which I had every morning, on my two previous stays. This time, I had it the first morning, and it was terrible. Ate outside the hotel for the remaining days. Very inconvenient.",Positive,,,,,
Everything at the hotel was nice and clean. Thanks,Positive,,,,,
"My fiancÃ© and I booked the Hyatt in Green Bay, WI, because we had previously stayed at a Hyatt in Chicago, IL-- and loved it. We are very displeased with our stay in at the Hyatt, in WI, and will not be returning. 
Here are a few things, which have steered our stay to other locations moving forward.
1. The room was not clean. We arrived and paid for early check in-- yet got put in a room that had dust all over the place.
2. The tv had a burn mark. 
3. The carpet had a wrinkle in it, between the sliding door and bed, causing me to trip in the middle of the night. 
4. Went to look in the brochure to find the floor in which the laundry room was, and the brochure appeared to be half eaten by an animal-- therefore we had to call the lobby for them to tell us, what we should have been able to know without calling. That's the whole point of a brochure in a guest room. Very inconvenient. 
5. The view that we had was horrendous. Opening our curtains, to find we had a beautiful view of the AC units. 
6. We paid extra for the morning breakfast. Upon arrival, there was no host. We asked a server and she said ""seat yourself, and someone will come get your drinks."" We did just that. And 10 minutes went by. We had to get up not just once, but twice to get our drinks. That is terrible service and very  unacceptable. 

Like stated above, we will not be returning to the Hyatt Hotels. The many inconveniences and awful service in the dining area, have made up our mind, that we will in fact take our money elsewhere and stay where we feel we are appreciated.

Thank you,

"Parking was very inconvenient.  The bathroom had several square inches of black mold next to the tub - surprising that this was not noticed when the room was cleaned last. When I notified the desk, they did deal with it within the hour.  Food was very good.",Positive,,,,,
"It is unacceptable when a guest with a boat literally took up 6 parking spaces when parking is at a premium!!!!!!!!! I saw one car that had to park on the grass.  Also, a pain in the neck to get out of the parking lot with the gate.",Negative,,,,,
Our room was booked with the breakfast buffet.  When checking out I reminded the staff that I ate breakfast and she assured me it would not hit my bill as an additional charge.  When I received the online bill there was a $42 charge for breakfast.  So I called the front desk to remind them to remove and they said they would immediately and send me an updated e-mail.  I waited about 8 hours and still did not receive the e-mail so I called again.   This time the person was very helpful but she did say the prior person did not remove as she said she would.  I should not have to chase down overcharges on my vacation when I booked the room with breakfast.,Positive,,,,,
Neil (the manager) has been very helpful.,Positive,,,,,
The bathroom drain was a little plugged and may need attention but it was not so bad that it impacted our experience.,Negative,,,,,
$7  early check in fee (1â€™15â€) upset me because it was first time ever I was charged this,Negative,,,,,
"It's a beautiful hotel with friendly staff. The only minus i had was that the hash browns at the breakfast were bland and undercooked, but there were plenty of delicious alternatives. The price was great for the quality offered. Would definetly come again.",Positive,,,,,
Why is there no towel bars in the bathroom?,Neutral,,,,,
"Only problem I had with the room was the air conditioning was under powered, however it kept the room at 72 and for the age of the building, that was fine with me, would be nice if it was able to cool it off a little more though however.",Positive,,,,,
Would be nice to include either breakfast or parking in the cost. Seems high for a Green Bay hotel.,Positive,,,,,
Lori and noely were so nice and kind!  They got us the perfect room!  The manager Neal was helpful and welcoming also!,Positive,,,,,
Aged appearance,Neutral,,,,,
Everything was great. Only thing was the kids in the pool that were unsupervised,Positive,,,,,
"Our room was intended to have a ""mini fridge"" in it, however, the mini-fridge was marked ""cooler"" instead and it was set in to a cabinet in such a way that it was impossible to easily shut the door.  The door was accidentally left open due to the cabinet (it looked shut), which led to the items in there spoiling.  Additionally, we checked in with a ""bed and breakfast rate"" that included the breakfast buffet.  I had to ask how we were to do that, and the front desk person was unsure.  We were also offered a ""quiet"" room when we checked in online.  The room we had most certainly was not quiet as my son (who was on the pull-out couch) was kept awake by children running up and down the hallway the first night we were there.",Positive,,,,,
"The room and bathroom were overall clean, but the bathroom trash can was not emptied from the last stay. Room service took over an hour and came as I was walking out of the door to check out, A part of my order was eggs and bacon and I received eggs and hash browns and they were just thrown together in box mixed. This is the second stay that we have had issues with room service. The last time we were here we also got none of our requests met, we really needed towels and coffee and didnâ€™t get them. Food service wasnâ€™t even picking up that trip, I kept getting routed to front desk, took 30 minutes to place an order with someone. We really like this place and will keep coming back but really hope we donâ€™t continue having these issues.",Positive,,,,,
"One of the lamps were out; the drinking glass was left in the bathroom, threw the shower cap away because it had a hole but it was placed on the counter in the bathroom with no replacement and I was shocked with that experience as well as the drinking glasses.",Positive,,,,,
"Stay was wonderful but the food for the SNA conference was not hot and not enough was on the breakfast buffet, ran out and not replenished adequately! Servers were very kind.",Positive,,,,,
Great room and great experience definitely plan on going back! Personally I think 1 of the best hotels in the green bay area!,Positive,,,,,
"Had breakfast Friday and Saturday, Friday staff was excellent, Saturday staff not as organized, forgot drink orders, didnt clean tables, etc",Positive,,,,,
"The breakfast buffet was not kept clean of spills and crumbs, many items not refilled even 1 hr before end .  Waited forever for beverage order to be taken",Positive,,,,,
Wonderful selection for breakfast,Positive,,,,,
"Loved your hotel. Staff are excellent, very friendly and professional. Room was clean, comfortable, and large. Will stay here again and recommend to others for future Green Bay trips.",Positive,,,,,
validating parking went very well.,Positive,,,,,
"The bathroom and shower were still partly dirty when I arrived. One of the lights in the room would not turn on. I stayed at this hotel a few years ago and I loved the options for room service. This time there were not many options, I had to plan other ways to eat because there were only a few options on the menu.",Positive,,,,,
"why do you say the breakfast opens at 6:30, but the food isnt ready until 6:40 or later?  Wait staff was apathetic at best, couldnt seem to get a refill on coffee or water ever.",Positive,,,,,
I have more detailed feedback to provide.,Positive,,,,,
Parking lot was full needed to pay extra to park across the street. Odd oder when I came in my room.,Positive,,,,,
Rooms were awesome. Love the Starbuck coffee. Pool area great for our grandchildren. Only thing but very minimal was the speed of the elevators. Great bar and staff.,Positive,,,,,
Salmon and steak size too small on salmon entree and salad with steak added option,Positive,,,,,
Parking lot doesn't hold as many vechiles as rooms therefore guests are forced to find parking elsewhere.  Parking in the structure is expensive.  There should be discounts given to hotel guests.,Negative,,,,,
Very cold in the meeting rooms,Negative,,,,,
Room was musty smelling. Room was in great need of updating. Furniture was old. Toilet was the size that you find in an elementary school. Very low and uncomfortable to use.,Negative,,,,,
"Disappointed about the parking situation. Should have been informed of the probability we could not park on the lot even though the parking fee was in place. After complaining about being directed to park in the free public parking across the street, parking charges were removed.  We were concerned because we had to travel to airport before 5a.",Negative,,,,,
Something a little loud was happening directly across the atrium from my room... Who hosts a bachelorette party on a Monday night?,Negative,,,,,
"I didn't eat in the restaurant, but alot of my conference friends and I drank in the bar. There was not enough help and closed early. Very disappointing when this is our time away.",Negative,,,,,
"I wish that you would have taller toilets, for older people its hard to get up from those low ones. There wasn't a towel rack, missed that.",Positive,,,,,
I was there for a conference and there was a continental buffet breakfast.  They ran out of food half-way through the serving time.,Positive,,,,,
"The room was very nice, the only suggestion would be to double check the sink in the bathroom as there were a pair of fake eyelashes by the faucet handles (I don't wear).  It wasn't a big deal, I threw them away and moved on.",Neutral,,,,,
Breakfast at SNA Conference was not okay.  Not enough food and poor service.,Neutral,,,,,
Very friendly and helpful!,Positive,,,,,
"I called my first day to let the front desk know that my tub wasn't draining, but it was not fixed. Housekeeping came on day 2, but didn't restock my coffee bar? Also, the bar staff was awesome, but terribly overworked. There were not enough people staffed to accommodate us. Not their fault, but unfortunate. Overall, a great stay, though. People there are always nice.",Negative,,,,,
I was charged 32. 00 for parking in your lot.,Neutral,,,,,
I was impressed with the room from the moment I walked in.  Very spacious.  The room was about the size of my Milwaukee condo.  I was very comfortable during my stay.,Positive,,,,,
"The bathroom was not cleaned, there was hair on the floor and the toilet tank was dusty. The cabinet shelves by the refrigerator were sticky with something and it looked like only some of the room was vacuumed in spots. I had 2 cars for my room, and I could only get one validated. The other car had to park in the lot across the hotel because she came later and the hotel lot was full. Parking should be included in the hotel price?",Positive,,,,,
"The only issue I had was that there was a $25 hold on my card in addition to my total bill that I was not made aware of, so I thought I had been overcharged.",Neutral,,,,,
Did not like parking.  Not accommodating to keep going to desk for a new ticket punch to get in and out of lot.,Positive,,,,,
"Never staying there again. They donâ€™t have enough parking for all the hotel guests if thereâ€™s a wedding or convention. Check in is at 3 but when I arrived at 5:15 with all my luggage and 4 kids, my room wasnâ€™t ready and I had to wait in the lobby until my room was clean. The knob was falling off my bathroom door. When I made the reservation and when I checked in I requested a crib but a request was never made. I had to call the front desk again from the room and request a crib for a third time before I got one. I forgot something in the pool area and called the hotel the next day to see if it was in lost and found, I was on hold for 15 mins and never got an answer and finally hung up because I was on my way into work and couldnâ€™t wait any longer.",Positive,,,,,
Just speed up the elevators. They were a bit slow and annoying to wait for.,Negative,,,,,
"not clean
too expensive for a filthy room",Neutral,,,,,
I would have liked to purchase one of those motion detection lights in the room,Positive,,,,,
Parking and staff was horrible. Hotel room very nice. I will not be returning to this location in Green Bay WI due to the staff.,Negative,,,,,
The outside of the windows needs a serious cleaning.,Positive,,,,,
Enjoyed my stay.,Positive,,,,,
This is the worst Hyatt Regency Hotel I have stayed at. I travel all across the country and selected this hotel because of past experiences at Hyatt Regency Hotels. This particular hotel needs a total revamp. The smurf toilet was so small and sat very low. The lampshades were very dirty. The pull-out sofa bed had metal springs sticking out of it and extremely uncomfortable to sleep or sit on. The bed mattress had big stains on it. The sheets had holes on them and very worn. The paint on the walls was horrible. The doors did not close tight. Windows were nasty and dirty. Caulking around the bathroom was breaking up and had mold. Just horrible room.,Negative,,,,,
"Quality of service was good, but there is always a room for improvement. A smile on their face and saying good morning and good afternoon when ever people approach them it will make it more personal for people to come back an stay at your facility.",Positive,,,,,
Was a excelent service,Neutral,,,,,
.,Neutral,,,,,
the patio door on room 623 would not latch,Neutral,,,,,
"There was only one minor thing...there was a fake eyelash that fell out that was stuck in one of the bathroom towels when I went to use it.  Not a big thing, and I didn't tell the hotel staff, but it is worth noting here.",Negative,,,,,
"The REFRESH salad on Sunday noon was sub standard, no dressing, the bread was twice as small as the bread served to us on Friday noon. The waitress brought the wrong dressing when we asked here, she also blamed the chef for the poor quality. We were very very unhappy by the qualithy of the REFRESH salad and the service",Negative,,,,,
"Things I'd have liked in the room:  a towel bar in the bathroom; heat protecting sleeves to slip onto the coffee cups which get very hot when coffee is put in them.
Service was very slow in the bar/restaurant on the first floor when I ate there on Saturday, even though it didn't seem very busy with customers.",Positive,,,,,
Parking was a big drawback.  It wasn't convenient to have to park in the parking structure across the street and pay for that.,Positive,,,,,
"I'm short, bed was high...hard to climb into, needed stool.",Negative,,,,,
Front desk people were very helpful when our key card ceased to function properly,Positive,,,,,
I was unable to stop the drain in the sink in my bathroom,Negative,,,,,
The reservation staff was wonderful!,Positive,,,,,
"1. I have a handicapped permit; no spots were available. No apologies for inadequate handicapped spaces, only a lecture and advise to go to public parking. Again, no apology for requiring me to walk further. 2. On checking in, having purchased an upgrade that included breakfast, I received not ""Welcome,"" nor any info about how to redeem the breakfasts. When I returned to inquire, rather than giving me the info directly, I was asked for my room number so they could verify my eligibility. 3. When I arrived, all parking lot gates were open. When I tried to leave, the gate was closed. Again I went to registration. ""Didn't you have your ticket stamped?"" she asked. ""What ticket?"" I asked. Then I was told there was a button I could push. I made a complaint about the generally bad service. I got no apology but a lecture on why ""things were as they were."" 4. Our convention is booked for there again next year. I hope that the front desk personnel are all required to take a course is simple hospitality. Perhaps they could learn something from Hampton Inns where I've never had a negative experience of hundreds of stays.",Positive,,,,,
"Dining at the lounge had to wait 1-1/2.  Not sure of issue but was compensated.  Was also going to report room 426 toilet rocks sideways, not sure of the issue.  Staff was excellent, love the facility.  Very pleasant stay when there was so many things going on at the center.",Positive,,,,,
"No black tea Available in the restaurant and I was there for 4 days! There was some in the room, but nine in the restaurant and they didnâ€™t make any efforts to get any. I like tea with me breakfast and nut herbal tea in the morning. Why couldnâ€™t they fix a simple issue like this? They didnâ€™t try. So I had to remember to bring my own tea bags down for breakfast .  I am bit referring to some special specific teaâ€”just any black or green tea, not an herbal decaf one fir breakfast.",Positive,,,,,
It's a beautiful hotel staffed by competent and friendly employees.  Five stars and will definitely consider staying here again if/when I'm back in Green Bay.,Positive,,,,,
"I was part of the Wisconsin Annual Conference.  On Saturday, there was a rush at the 333.  Our waitress was very nice.  However, they were extremely understaffed and it took over 45 minutes for us to get our food.  The food was good but the portions were smaller than expected.",Positive,,,,,
"Sunday, June 16, the Pub33 was very crowded for lunch.  The service was slow.  We waited way too long for our food.  It was good when it finally arrived.",Positive,,,,,
"Great space, great service.",Positive,,,,,
Had trouble regulating heat thermostat.,Negative,,,,,
Food at the Pub was good but food purchased at the Market (breakfast sandwich) and a â€œticketedâ€ meal for the Conference were not so good.,Positive,,,,,
The room was good and the service great.  My one bummer was the lack of stair options to get up and down to 2nd floor from the inside of the hotel.,Neutral,,,,,
"The person I talked to on the phone for my booking ending up booking a room that was already full. When I got there, whoever was working the front desk righted the situation and got me a better room for 50% off. I love how it now has the texting feature for room service!",Positive,,,,,
Parking was insufficient for hotel that size. So glad that you had recycling bins in the room and throughout hotel. I had a work function that ran until noon and usually hotels will grant me an extra hour for a later check out but I was surprisingly turned down. I know the hotels are sometimes booked up but it would have been great to get just one more hour. Thanks for having a vegetarian option in the restaurant.,Positive,,,,,
"As a Hyatt, I expected much better  facilities.  It was very obviously a rehabbed Embassy Suites. Nothing to love about it, nothing to hate. Just another hotel.",Positive,,,,,
"Was not happy with parking situation.  There was a bug on the bed and the sheets showed some stains... kind of gross.  At check-in individual didn't mention the 25.00 fee that would be reimbursed at checkout so I had to ask why the pending charge was more than what I was quoted.  Not a big deal, but it should be mentioned at check in.",Negative,,,,,
"only issue: after the first day of the state bar conference, I asked the front desk if the hotel had any outdoor space - that I wanted to enjoy the weather outside that evening - she said no, but it turns out there is a nice outdoor seating area by the conference center that I saw the next day. I wanted to enjoy a nice summer evening after a day at the conference and found out that others had taken a nice walk along the river that evening. I spent the evening in my room instead, a corner room with no windows! the front desk could have told me about the trail along the river and the seating by the river side of the conference center. that was very disappointing. Why aren't staff aware of the surroundings and concerned about my experience outside the walls of the building?",Positive,,,,,
"Food at the. PUB, breakfast buffet, and Starbucks was good and the servers were very pleasant.  The check in people were hassled and gave no greeting or goodbye come again.  The other workers were happy to direct you and answer questions.  Hotel very nice too bad the mall is gone and there is walking distance to general shopping,",Positive,,,,,
"Staff at the pub need to be more 
attentive to customers-  we waited for ever! 
Front desk staff-fantastic!",Positive,,,,,
Nice hotel.  Clean and good space for conventions.  The hotel should get more food options.,Positive,,,,,
"We had a group in town, and that can be very challenging.  They did their best to be patient with me as changes came up- and I appreciate it.",Positive,,,,,
The bathroom was too small,Positive,,,,,
"The worst HYATT I have ever stayed at. Among the gross deficiencies- no valet service, no bellmen, no concierge, no earl y morning compliment coffee in the restaurant or check in area, inadequate  parking and an uninformed front desk with little empathy and knowledge",Negative,,,,,
"Breakfast had overcooked scrambled eggs and terrible sausage gravy, thin and oniony.   I figured, oh well it was free, but NO, a big surprise,13 bucks.   You need free breakfast like everyone else....and especially since it wasn't very good.  Your materials weren't real clear I would be paying.",Positive,,,,,
"We were billed for parking, however, when we got back to the hotel, there was NO place to park. So, we had to find our own parking & pay for it at 12:30 at night. We tried to talk to someone about this, but there was 1 person working and there were people lined up. We tried talking again to someone in the am when we left, But again, one person working and they were busy with other people. I would say you are understaffed and WHY would you charge for parking when there wasn't any?? For the price we paid, this was outrageous!",Negative,,,,,
Should allow check out the same as the end of the event that we were at,Positive,,,,,
Loved the bathroom amenities.  Breakfast was delicious and high quality.  The front desk people were very helpful.,Positive,,,,,
"Looked to me the hotel was a bit outdated and could use a face lift. I think this may have been an Embassy Suite prior which is fine. Rooms were good size
Elevators were horrible. Very slow. Took stairs mainly but 7 floors up were tiring (down was not too bad!)",Negative,,,,,
I had three rooms on hold at the Hyatt for a wedding and when I checked in I pacifically told the girl I was paying for one room two other people were paying for the other rooms she said she understood that charge me for one room second person checks in they pay for the room third person comes to check in they put it on my credit card that was on Friday on Saturday morning I go down there and I say all three rooms were charged different right she looks up the information and she says yes the other two people will use their credit card you're only being charged for one room that in fact is not true I was charged for two rooms,Positive,,,,,
The room I was in was not vacuumed very well and at least one light was not plugged in.,Positive,,,,,
My room was barely cleaned.  The bed was not well made it looked like the duvet was just pulled up messily.  Bathroom and floor were not cleaned.  No new shower gel was left so I was out of gel.  The ironing board has so many ingrained wrinkles I could not effectively iron my shirt.  My room was not disheveled I feel a decent cleaning should have been reasonably easy.,Positive,,,,,
"Check in was not great.  Arrived at two pm. room wasn't ready.  We were told our online check in didn't go through.  Returned at 3:30 told us online check in worked.   Friendliness was not apparent, but hotel was busy so probably flustered.",Positive,,,,,
The hotel and our room were very nice. The room was comfortable. The bathroom though was incredibly smaller in relation to the size of the room. We kept our towels for the duration of our stay but there is no towel rack to hang them on. We had to hang them over the shower. I think the Hyatt can afford to supply towel racks.,Positive,,,,,
We were in town to see a concert that started at 8 .We couldn't get in our room until almost 6:30 . The bathroom was disgusting and we didn't get the room we reserved and didn't have time for dinner before the concert. The manager was very apologetic and discounted our room. I have been staying there for many years and couldn't believe what was happening.,Negative,,,,,
The only complaint we had was the room was a little warm for our liking and we had the ac on but it never changed how hot it was in the room. Other than that 10 out of 10.,Neutral,,,,,
Food choices could have included more vegetable matter.,Positive,,,,,
The lack of parking for guests was disappointing,Negative,,,,,
The mattress on the pull out sofa was stained.  The phone in the room didn't work.,Positive,,,,,
"I had to ask for a rollaway cot four times before it was delivered, and by the time it was finally delivered, it cost me about 30 minutes of sleep.   Parking situation is deplorable. Had to park across the street.",Negative,,,,,
"Elevator were so slow it actually angered myself along with all other guest trying to get up and down.  Emma at check in was great, a couple other of the younger girls were absolutely awful.  Iâ€™m a young guy, itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m looking down on them.  You have a job within hospitality- act accordingly or find another job.  I donâ€™t need anyone to be overly nice or make me feel a certain way - but the lack of helpfulness and acting like an angry teen thatâ€™s mad she has to work was embarrassing..... on her behalf.",Positive,,,,,
Check-in lines were long. What good does checking in online do if one still waits in the regular line? Needed more staff to help. Breakfast ends at 10AM Sunday! That would have been good to know at check-in.,Positive,,,,,
"Came to town to see concert Sat night.  My room was NOT READY until after 5 PM!!!  Others same problem.  Not enough help and not organized!!  Needed to change clothes, freshen up and eat dinner before 8PM concert.  Only after I complained vigorously did the manager surface with a room.  She did apologize and gave me 10,000 Hyatt points.  Still, way less than average experience.",Positive,,,,,
Check in time is 3:00pm. We made our schedule with this time. Our room was not ready. Due to this we missed our scheduled ride to our event. Did not receive any assistance on back up transportation. We had to pay double for a ride to our event. We were unable to get ready for our event due to the latter check in time. I booked a corner suite and expected to be able to enjoy some time to use the pool and relax before we had to leave for our event. This did not happen.,Positive,,,,,
"Great place, convenient location!",Positive,,,,,
"Emma was wonderful at the front desk very helpful, answered our questions and offered great dining suggestions",Positive,,,,,
When check in is at 3 the rooms should be ready by then. Still were not ready at 5 20 and had no expected time on when they would be when asked. Called me at 6 that the room was ready.,Positive,,,,,
All good,Positive,,,,,
"Parking situation night of Paul McCartney concert was awful, food at the Pub 333 was awful, sink faucet in our room 704 was loose and wobbly",Negative,,,,,
Nice bar in suite!!!,Positive,,,,,
"Room was great, except there was no ventilation in the bathroom (no exhaust system) causing a very foggy experience plus there were no hooks for the bath towels. Towel storage in cubby holes adjacent to the sink were not good options. I was rather annoyed that guests were making a lot of noise late Saturday evening/ Sunday morning in the atrium. I was surprised no employee attempted to quiet the group. Everyone in all guest rooms had to have heard the racket",Positive,,,,,
"The room smelled damp and musty which could be because it was above the pool. I was using points and was initially given a room on the 2nd floor overlooking the room and AC units. I requested a different room with a view and was given a 2nd floor room over looking a busy street. Was I given poor locations due to my using points? The parking lot was full both nights causing me to have to park across the street in a public lot, and then go to the front desk and get my parking ticket for the Hyatt lot cancelled. I was prepared for this problem, as it was noted in many Trip Advisor comments. However, the front desk never made mention of what to do for alternate parking arrangements if the lot is full. Complementary valet should be offered on nights with high occupancy or events (such as a wedding which was occurring when I was there).",Negative,,,,,
"2 comments for consideration ... the toilet in our room was very low to the floor which  made it difficult to use and expected to have Kleenex in the room, but there wasn't any.  Overall, very satisfied with the stay and look forward to coming back again.",Positive,,,,,
Would have liked if I got a new bath soap bar.  I take 2 showers a day and had to use a different bar at the end for the last shower.,Positive,,,,,
I greatly dislike that rate increased $100 for the same type of room from 2018 on Bellin Run weekend. I even registered later in 2018 than last year. Not worth extra $100.,Positive,,,,,
We are both left handed and if you hold the key card in your left hand the bar code is on the wrong side and of course won't work.  I don't know what you can do for this but it was an issue for us until we did it with our right hand.  Felt really dumb about that one.,Negative,,,,,
You need better signage from the Main Street about where to enter by car.,Positive,,,,,
The check-in/out staff were friendly and efficient.,Positive,,,,,
Some issue with lobby noise after midnight,Neutral,,,,,
Your brochure in the room indicates $5 for parking during the stay but we were charged $14 for 2 days. We had problems leaving the lot on our last day. You cannot read any of the signs on the south exit ticket box. We had to back up and go to the front desk who my husband said was a bit snippy like just push the silver button for help.....well there were 3 silver buttons with totally faded stickers that were even cracked from the sun. We had to guess which one to push. Also I may be wrong but why are employees parking close to the entrance instead of in back of the lot. They even have to at WalMart for customer courtesy. There was a black hand print on the shower stall. Otherwise we loved our room. We look for price when we stay because we are hardly there other than for the bed and shower so if the price is right we will be back.,Positive,,,,,
Too many rules.  No kids in pool after ten when you are hosting multiple baseball teams.  Quite time from 9pm is way to early.  No alcohol allowed in atrium.  It is the no fun hotel.  Will not be back,Positive,,,,,
Parking was a challenge.,Negative,,,,,
"Some suggestions:
-Garbage bags/liners in the trash cans would be more sanitary and desired! We have a child in diapers and did not like putting used diapers in an unlined trash can. 
- Our walking one year old latched on to picture in the bedroom that was hung very low on the bedroom. It fell off the wall and cut her head. No damage was done to the picture but it's not necessary to have one that low.
-We were very impressed with how friendly the staff was, how nice to the room and hotel were, and the use of umbrellas was great! We will definitely stay again!",Positive,,,,,
The free bottles of water was very appreciated,Positive,,,,,
"In the morning, there were no towels in the pool area. Despite raising this with the staff, none were supplied for over an hour. This resulted in me not swimming at all, which was disappointing.",Negative,,,,,
The motion activated night lights were a nice touch.,Positive,,,,,
"I did not have charges in the pub of $40.98
I was in the bar area with a group of ladies and I paid cash for my bill.

I have stayed at your hotel before and loved it, this time the experience was not so great.  The room was not very clean, also some people in our baseball group were told the breakfast was free and others like myself told it cost $10.50 so therefore I did not take advantage of it!  Very frustrating that I could have fed my family a nice breakfast.",Positive,,,,,
TV remotes didnâ€™t work.  HVAC fan noise in bedroom much louder than in other rooms Iâ€™ve previously stayed in at Hyatt Regency Green Bay.,Neutral,,,,,
Beautiful hotel.   Great staff. Very comfortable beds.   Pool area was perfect.   Will stay again!!!!,Positive,,,,,
Hot tub was cold,Negative,,,,,

Employees were great - but I have high expectations - so very good.  Kira did an especially nice gob.,Positive,,,,,
It is the most awesome hotel I ever stayed at...beautiful!!,Positive,,,,,
"check TV remote batteries? just to make sure strong signal...ours did not work from the bed, needed to get closer to TV to change channels. Not a big deal, just an inconvenience.",Positive,,,,,
"There were patrons at 5 tables and 2 people serving. The service was terrible. No one around for extended periods. Coffee was barely warm. I finally flagged down my waitress who proceeded to pour me another coffee, but it was now essentially cold out of the coffee pot. My omelette was mediocre, and the hash-browns were so over-salted with seasoning salt that they were essentially inedible. I waited for my waitress to come back... and waited... and... finally gave up and walked to the front desk who credited me the meal. I paid for breakfast with the room charge, but never ate there again. Rotten experience.

I had dinner at the bar twice and it was a pleasant experience both times.

Also, the thermostat in the room - setting it at 70 degrees left the room at about 64.  I turned it up to 74 and the room warmed up to the high 60s. After setting it to about 80 the room warmed up to 70.",Positive,,,,,
"Free breakfast???? nothing fancy, donut and coffee. Don't need to spend $12.50 for that!!",Positive,,,,,
Bed was great,Positive,,,,,
The elevators we're slow. The breakfast buffet was nothing special. I could get the same thing at a hotel that is just as nice but more affordable. The wait staff at the breakfast felt like they didn't want to be there.,Positive,,,,,
"Emma, has great customers skills two thumbs up.",Positive,,,,,
The breakfast staff was disappointing - very slow,Negative,,,,,
"Very kind, friendly, helpful, and patient staff.",Positive,,,,,
"I was surprised that the TV was smaller than expected for my large room, which I love the studio king room. Conditioner would have been nice. Also there was a breakfast buffet charged to my room before I even went to breakfast (and they weren't doing a buffet that day.)

I  LOVED almost everything about this place. I just had a very hard time with the windowed elevator's as I have vertigo and an aversion to heights. I wish there were fully inclosed elevator options,Positive,,,,,

"Food for the buffet was just barely warm except for the eggs were always hot. All breads were dry like they had been frozen to long. For $32 and a $10 cash tip I probably wouldn't spend that type of money on the buffet again. I did bring this to the attention of the staff somebody came out to rectify it. However by this time we were finishing up our plates and had to leave. on the second day the food temperatures were the same. On the third day we eat elsewhere.

As advertised on your website and in the years past when I stayed at your property a mini fridge  was provided. However this time the temperature was 45 to 47 degrees. A labeled stated ""this is cooler"" on the outside of the mini refrigerator. This is very alarming to me. I rented at this property because of the 2 room and I needed the use of a refrigerator. I did share my concerns with the front desk and they offered to bring me some ice packs. If all I wanted was a cooler I could have brought my own cooler from home and filled it with ice. They had no others to switch with nor any other rooms to switch so I was just stuck with a cooler in my room. Very alarming and we did not eat the food that was stored in the refrigerator. I was concerned of the potential health concerns. I'm aware frigerator according to the State regulations need to be 36 to 38 degrees.

The air conditioner never became any cooler than 71 degrees. Apparently there was something wrong with the air-conditioning. They did however provide me with a fan. It's unfortunate we had multiple rooms in use but only one fan could be provided.

In the past we have had great experiences at your property and that's why we continue to rebook. Perhaps these were just isolated issues.

I would like to make a note that the staff was absolutely outstanding. I did voice all of my concerns and each time.  They were sincerely apologetic and tried to accommodate and rectify the situations. I understand that there's only so much they could do.

Thank You,

Danielle at the front desk remembered me from January and that I was taking a trip to California. Amazing customer service!! She made the check-in experience friendly and easy!,Positive,,,,,
My main complaint was that I could not control the air conditioning. The lowest it got was 68 and a few times during the night it got up to 72 degrees. I like to sleep cold so I was very uncomfortable. I brought this up to the hotel staff and they had the engineer come up to the room. But since the hotel air conditioning is centralized we canâ€™t control it that much. So it kinda sucked and I slept uncomfortable.,Negative,,,,,

But from the room there was no way to shut that fan off so I didn't sleep good.

I called the front desk, they sent up a maintenance person who explained that they could not get the heat to work at this time.  The maintenance person came with a small portable heater for me to use which worked satisfactorily.  I did not expect this problem at a Hyatt Hotel !!!!!  I had to use the small space heater for the two nights of my stay.",Positive,,,,,

Next morning did buffet and had same service and the food was cold and not very good quality.  Worst food I have ever had in a Hyatt.  Very Disappointed to say the least.",Negative,,,,,

Front desk told me that overflow parking was in the city parking ramp around the corner.  I asked if the procedure for validating the parking receipt for the surface lot was the same for the overflow parking.  The woman working the front desk told me yes.  I checked out on May 17 and was told that the receipt from the overflow parking ramp could NOT be validated!  The $13.60 charge for parking was very disappointing!",Positive,,,,,

"the light in my room under the side table by the bed was frustrating. Disliked it. We went tot he on site restaurant 2 times and both times we terrible. The first time the spoon I got was completely filthy- dried on food on it that was super obvious- not a small speck- a large amount. The chili I ordered that came with the dirty spoon was cold- not just not super hot but COLD. How can that even happen? We didnt have a lot of time on our break so sent it back and just had the other thing I ordered. Then when my bill came I was still charged for the chili I sent back?! I asked her to remove it and she did but not only should she have removed it without asking at that point, someone should have maybe come to the table to appologise or offer a free soda or something? It was like they didnt even care. The second experience was for breakfast- food was not warm (eggs, sausages or hashbrowns) all of us were sorry we stayed in for breakfast- would have been worth the drive to get a good breakfast. Many dished were not even half full. Kind of dried out- and we were mid way through the monring not at the very end or anything? Lastly the parking was a huge problem- everytime we had to leave the hotel we couldnt park in the lot anymore. Had to park blocks away in the rain. Over all not a good experience.",Positive,,,,,
Neely San Juan was an excellent front desk attendant and representative of your organization.,Positive,,,,,
Our cooling in the room was broken. I asked to get it fixed because the room was 76 degrees for the 1st night. They sent someone up and it never turned off and never got cooler them 74 degrees. So I said something at checkout at was offered a coffee. I had somewhere to be so I couldnâ€™t even have that.,Negative,,,,,
"Room 364 - Old and outdated. The granite was newer, but it was like putting a fancy facade on an old dilapidated building. The bathrooms are micro small with no towel racks and very cramped. Lots of wasted space in the front of the room that should have been used to make the bathrooms adult size. The sleeping area was not spacious and the closet was poorly located. Iâ€™d give the room a C- for a grade.",Negative,,,,,
"The air fan was loud and not working properly resulting in lack of sleep. I informed the front desk Room 704. Also, I left a charger in my room after checkout- front desk said itâ€™s occupied with new customer and canâ€™t get charger. Unacceptable.",Positive,,,,,

"Daily issues:  TV having to be replaced, ankle deep water when showering, housekeeping placed the large couch stool over my slippers so took forever to find them, fan was very loud and ran all night until fixed, no breakfast buffet one day and was told if house numbers are too low they donâ€™t offer it (first item at the top of the menu and on your website with no disclaimer about when it is offered), front desk told me the garage across the street was more expensive to park in and ended up being $3 less per day for my schedule, some short strands of hair on shower wall from previous guests, elevator was the slowest Iâ€™ve ever ridden in, bus boy took my utensils and napkin when I went to the buffet table and same thing happened to the table next to mine, and servers were slow to check on me plus had to ask for more coffee.  I will say the staff was very nice and addressed my concerns when informed and paid for three breakfasts, but I donâ€™t feel, as a paying guest, that I should have to tell them what needs attention.  Very disappointed and will not stay there again.  I hope you go through and update this hotel.",Negative,,,,,

"Was surprised to see a bill for $144+ pending on our credit card, when the bill (we received a copy at check out) was for $119+.  Fortunately, this was corrected before being posted as a credit charge. Having had past experiences where food charges were added to our bill (we were incorrectly billed for dine in buffet after we had had room service breakfast delivered) we are very sensitive to the possibility of billing errors when we stay at the Hyatt.",Positive,,,,,

My parents stayed in room 732 and their heat did not work. They called several times about it. The person said that the thermostat was set to 72 but that was not the temperature in the room. Everything in the room was cold even the counter tops.,Negative,,,,,
"The hotel room, 207, is directly over the pool.  The room smells like mildew.  I expressed this to the front desk staff within one half hour of check in and was told they were sold out, but it seems that the actual reason i couldn't change rooms is that I was asked if I had used anything in room and I said I used the soap.  The rooms really need update from the 1980s layout.  The mildew smell should be addressed; room 207 smells like it has been consistently ""wet.""",Positive,,,,,
"The elevators were awful! They were so slow and not up to the task of dealing with all the people, especially conference attendees who were all going up and coming down at the same time. One of the elevators seemed to be broken one day, and that just made it so much worse. There was music being played in the atrium area in the evenings, and it was extremely loud in my room. I didn't appreciate that. The room was cold, and changing the thermostat had no effect. More effort should have been made to accommodate people who needed outlet access in the conference rooms. It didn't seem like the hotel was equipped to deal with our technological needs. The lack of sufficient parking for guests was also a concern. Who wants to stay at a hotel where they have to pay for parking?",Negative,,,,,

However, when I called I was informed the shuttle wasnâ€™t running again until 4:30pm. It was 12:30. I said someone had to come get us. Front Desk stayed no one was available but called a cab for us. I appreciate that she called a cab but we should not have been in that situation in the first place. Please ask your shuttle drivers to make sure they have all information before providing answers. Besides this blip, the stay was amazing and we will definitely come back.",Positive,,,,,

"We called four times that the AC in the room was not working, the staff brought a fan... And the solution was to put a fan by the window and nothing else. It was warm in the room, and noisy from the street. Not pleased.",Positive,,,,,
Very helpful staff.  Some of the rooms need some updating but overall was clean.,Positive,,,,,
Very noisy. Kids running around everywhere. Asked for a room away from the elevator and didnâ€™t get it,Negative,,,,,
"The room was great other than we couldnâ€™t turn the heat up from a chilly 69o no matter what we did with the thermostat.
The other issue is simply one of architecture. We had great difficulty using the elevator or walking to our room because there was only a foot or so and a short railing between us and falling several stories. The staff could not move us to a lower floor. Moreover, you could hear the lobby music rather clearly if you sat in the living room area of the suite. 
I wouldnâ€™t recommend this hotel to anyone who has a fear of heights problem. Or I would disclose that potential issue during reservations so the guest could request a room on the lower floor.
Great staff otherwise.",Negative,,,,,
"While the bed was was comfortable and the bedding clean, the room overall was not very clean.  the window had smudges on it.  the tv screens were dirty.  There were food crumbs on the counter top.  The carpet was gross.  the cabinet that contained the fridge was dirty on the bottom.  The sides of the bar were full of greasy finger prints.  This gave the room a bit of a grungy feel.  the updates to the room were nice.",Negative,,,,,
"I stayed 4 nights and never received any additional soap, shampoo, conditioner, etc. I had to contact the front desk on 2 occasions (random earrings in my bathroom and no coffee or cups refilled). There was more but I felt like a pest so I didnâ€™t bother with the soap issue or the fact that a dirty pillowcase was left in my bathroom or that my toilet had to be flushed multiple times to work. Staff at the front desk were very nice though!",Positive,,,,,

"The city parking lot information regarding the need to get another ticket from the front desk each time you leave needs to be in signage as you leave the hotel as a reminder.    At time of registration, lots goes on and all I heard was you will need this ticket to leave the parking lot.  It will permit you to exit one time and when you return you need to obtain another ticket at the front desk.  Signage stating such would be helpful near the elevator and front desk. or a small sheet or in the key envelope.     I couldn't get out of the parking lot with the previous ticket so paid and the front desk assisted with my payment taken off the room bill.",Positive,,,,,
I ate at the restaurant and got food poisoning,Negative,,,,,

"Check in was supposed to be at 3:00pm, but the room was not ready until 5:30.  Was attending a conference and the food set up did not make sense.  The lines backed up into the next buffet, probably a better idea to move them around the room for a convention over 700.",Positive,,,,,
Breakfast was cold.  Didn't get 4 of my 7 rooms until 7:30 pm.  Do not book back to back large groups if you can't turn the rooms over in time.,Positive,,,,,

"Good morning, we stayed at the Hyatt for a dance competition and we enjoy the hotel very much as we were there last year for this competition as well. The only bummer was that there was a dance competition rate of $90, which I figured out after I checked in. I called down to the desk and the person wasn't able to change anything, so he told me to come down in the morning. So the following morning I came down and was told that since the night before already processed there was no way to change that but the manager did change the rate for the second night. After some thought about that during the day, I asked again that evening and a different person said he could change it. But then, at check out the rate hadn't changed and the manager said she couldn't. So what would have been an awesome customer service opportunity to honor the dance competition rate, wasn't and now I would prefer to stay at another facility.  Also, currently the amount charged to my credit card is higher than my check out receipt, so I need to call about that. On a happy note, my daughter left her pillow and housekeeping found it and are mailing it back to us.",Positive,,,,,
Everything was excellent. I took one point off because the building was showing its age.,Positive,,,,,
My room was too cold at 65 degrees and the air conditioning fan blew all night. The staff tried to correct the problem but was unable. They gave me a space heater.,Negative,,,,,
I requested our rate be adjusted for the 2nd evening since we were not eating breakfast on Sunday morning and it was not.,Positive,,,,,
"I could not change the thermostat setting in my room, and the front desk was unable to help with my request.  I believe there may be an issue with the equipment (#833).  It was tolerable, so I did not ask for maintenance to assist, but you might choose to look at it.  That was my only disappointment with the facility.",Positive,,,,,
"Check-In asked for a card to keep on file for ""incidentals."" Rather than my room being charged on another card provided when room was reserved, the room was charged on my incidental card. Found out two days later the morning of checking out. Though the hold was cancelled it still in the meantime screwed up my personal finances and I was charged bank fees that I would otherwise would not have incurred if not for your check-in staff member that miscommunicated and appeared drugged. 
The carpet in the room was filthy along the walls and felt dirty. Would not walk in the room barefoot.",Negative,,,,,
There were several things in the room that either needed to be repaired or were shoddily repaired. The bathtub was patched in a very unprofessional way - not what I would expect at a Hyatt Regency. The faucet was leaky and sprayed out when you turned it on. There was also a moldy non-slip bath mat sitting upright in the bathroom. It needs to be replaced and kept clean.,Positive,,,,,
"The group that I was with had an issue with the security. It was discussed with the manager who was very receptive as well as the front desk staff. The entire staff minus the security staff, from front desk to the shuttle drivers were wonderful. I would stay here again in the hopes that the security guards have been addressed and that we don't have an issue with them again.",Positive,,,,,

Room was clean but when we went to use the fold out bed on the couch ...there were dirty linens in the mattress...,Neutral,,,,,
"The security staff had a very aggressive body and verbal language.  They were taking unnecessarily to my daughter and other dancers who were quietly by us in the lobby.  When we booked the hotel room I was never informed that I would be ""parented"" and forced to enter my room at a certain time because sitting quietly and talking in the lobby was against policy?  The security guard threatened to call the police on my autistic 13 year old daughter for quietly playing cards with her friends and not being in her hotel room at 9pm when the group had just finished dancing for 12 hours and wanted to hang out.  My biggest concern is that both security officers knew the children belonged to us and could have asked us to send them to the rooms but waited until we had gone to order food to loudly, and aggressively, threaten to call the police if they didn't move right then.  This is absolutely unacceptable to me.  Not to mention, I work at an inner city school that is gang trained and your security guard is allowed to wear ""thors hammer"", which is a known symbol of a supremacist group.   It is unfathomable to me that a hotel would allow that!  As adults, we were kicked out of the lobby at midnight.  We were told we ""could party the next time we got together and could get wasted""... EXCUSE ME!!  We were quietly planning a function and eating snacks.  Even if we were having an alcoholic beverage, our talk was no more than a whisper.  We love the midwest Starz dance competition that was held at your location but I'm not sure we will be staying at the Hyatt next year.  I'd much rather have our 20 rooms stay next door at the Hilton where we can be treated appropriately and with respect instead of with superiority and aggression.",Negative,,,,,
"The air conditioning didn't work, half the lights in our room did not work, the elevators were slow as heck and our room keys did not work.",Negative,,,,,
The room I was in was pretty clean however i did find contacts on the nightstand and a black smudge on the sheets. The vent for the heat above the bedroom door was super noisy when it was blowing and the bathroom door was extremely squeaky and loud as well.,Positive,,,,,
This is a wonderful property and the very reason I prefer Hyatt.  Top notch!,Positive,,,,,
"We were at the hotel for a dance competition at the convention center. Being so there should not have been ""adult time"" only in the pool area or a sign displayed as quiet time. There were very disrespectful security guards to children and adults. One in particular who even threatened to call the police on children. I have recommended to Midwest Starz to no longer use your hotel as a competition sight, as children should never been threatened or feel intimated.",Positive,,,,,
the thermostat was not working well. I called several times. They were nice and brought a fan up to the room.  The food was ok - the potatoes were swimming in oil. the dinner was tasty though.,Positive,,,,,
Have more options in your lobby cafe for a quick grab and go breakfast,Positive,,,,,
We love staying at your hotel for dance.  The only downfall is the elevators are horribly slow and there are no stairs you can just walk down to avoid the elevators.,Negative,,,,,

I had to wait both time I ate in the hotel for at least 20 minutes for a bill after requesting a bill.",Positive,,,,,
Overall a good stay. Wait staff seemed new/in training. Reception staff friendly and professional,Positive,,,,,
I couldnâ€™t figure out how to adjust the air in my room or turn the fan off. I probably couldâ€™ve called guest services. The breakfast buffet food was not good. Next time I wonâ€™t get the continental package and buy from the gift shop. Loved the big TV in my room and bed was comfy. I will be back.,Positive,,,,,
Kolton was wonderful and very friendly.  And when I seen him the next morning he addressed me by name. I was pleasantly surprised by that I had only had contact with him one time before that.,Positive,,,,,
Extra thanks to Emma for her help this week. Keep up the great work!,Positive,,,,,
"Shuttle service was very much appreciated, and the staff-drivers were extremely courteous and sociable.
The fitness room is excellent, one of the best I've had a chance to use at a hotel.
Future improvement: Get rid of the carpets. A huge undertaking, I realize, but I think that the outcome would be worth it.",Positive,,,,,
Expensive,Negative,,,,,
The pool was too cold for my liking to swim in.  It was a shame because my grand daughter was so looking forward to a good swim.,Positive,,,,,
"The room was too cold. During my last stay, I recalled how cold the room so this time I packed heavy socks, PJs and robe to sleep in - I thought I was prepared. The room was freezing. I called the Front Desk and housekeeping brought a heater.",Negative,,,,,
Always nice to stay here,Positive,,,,,
See you again soon. Thanks!,Positive,,,,,
"The food in the bar/ restaurant was phenomenal. The staff superb.  As always, a great experience",Positive,,,,,
"Would like full size mirror, breakfast included would be fantastic",Positive,,,,,
"The hvac system didn't work well and the maintenance person came by to explain about the change of season making it so. the room temp was 67 and the fan was running non-stop with room temp air, which felt cool. I tried turning up the temp on the thermostat, which made the fan run but not with warmer air. Maint suggested that I turn the thermostat down so the fan would stop running, which worked but then as the temp dropped in the room, I had to keep doing that. Maint also offered to bring a space heater, which I declined.",Positive,,,,,
"Staff are excellent, but it's an old tired feeling hotel.  Sink in bathroom backs up, the shower faucet is bent of angle as if it's been twisted.  This hotel is much better elsewhere",Positive,,,,,
Need to switch rooms. Mechanicals very loud. Staff handled request quickly,Negative,,,,,
We stay with you every year and always enjoy it!,Positive,,,,,
In checking my Credit card account 2 days later I was overcharged $25.00 on what my bill should of been. Now I have a waste of my time on mind hands to get this problem corrected I will not being staying at any Hyatt in the future.,Negative,,,,,
Kolton (front desk receptionist - unsure how to spell his name) remembered me from the day before and that was pretty remarkable given that many people had checked in and talked with him before and after I had that were also their for the conference!  He was very kind and accommodating!,Positive,,,,,
"Our room wasnâ€™t room. 
Found a new room for us!",Positive,,,,,
"Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.  The chef-prepared omelets were terrific.  While the breakfast staff was very good and friendly, they were a bit overwhelmed on Saturday and Sunday mornings when it was very busy. I would have preferred to get my own coffee & refills. It would have been faster, and freed up the staff to attend to other customers waiting to be seated & taking care of payments.",Positive,,,,,
"WE STAYED FOR 2 NIGHTS AND I WAS SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED THAT WE DID NOT GET TWO REPLENISHED BOTTLES OF SHAMPOO & BODY WASH AFTER OUR FIRST DAY.  NOT A DEAL BREAKER... I TOLD MY WIFE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE SHAMPOO AND BODY WASH IN OUR ROOM;  HOWEVER, SHE BROUGHT HER OWN TOILETRIES SO IT WAS NOT A BIG DEAL  ALSO, WE ALSO HAD TO REQUEST A HAIRDRYER.  MY WIFE WAS MAD AS I TOLD HER NOT TO PACK HER OWN HAIRDRYER.  IT KIND OF  MADE IT UNCOMFORTABLE FOR ME;  HOWEVER,  YOUR STAFF GOT US A HAIRDRYER AND APOLOGIZED FOR A HAIRDRYER NOT BEING IN THE ROOM.  OTHER THAN THAT, WE ARE STILL MARRIED...  THANKS FOR LISTENING....",Negative,,,,,
We stayed at the Hyatt Regency for my son's wedding.  Everyone thought the rooms were wonderful and the hotel was awesome.  Thank you for helping make my son and daughter-in-law's experience so enjoyable!,Positive,,,,,
"I was impressed. Honestly I think it's the best hotel stay I've ever had. Every employee was helpful, and the bed was the most comfortable I've slept in at a hotel. Pleased!",Positive,,,,,
Another great stay. Staff is always very helpful and friendly.,Positive,,,,,
"Love the ""suites"" which give me room to work on projects.  Supplies were good except couldn't find the kleenex.  Housekeeper pointed out they were under the phone stand.",Positive,,,,,
"We had a great experience with all staff, except for the bar manager Saturday night. We saw the sign saying no outside food or drinks. We had a slice of pizza and a drink from the wedding we just left. We stopped at the door and asked if would be ok to just stop in and say hello to my brother, who was 1 of like 4 people in the bar. After asking if it was ok to bring our small things in, we walked in to say hi. The man in a blue shirt standing at the end of the bar told us to get out and said â€œNo outside food or drinks, thereâ€™s even a sign at the door saying so.â€ He was incredibly rude and if he would have just answered us in the first place instead of ignoring us, it would have been fine. He could have also just kindly said we couldnâ€™t bring our items in, instead of being a rude, unprofessional person.",Positive,,,,,
The only thing l don't like is the restaurant. It is to expensive and we waited almost 50 minutes for our food and they weren't busy.,Positive,,,,,
"I would suggest that you remove the corn hole bean bag game from the lobby. The sound of the bean bag hitting the board and adults cheering was so loud I could hear it in my room. Two other large groups of people (prom and wedding) also were getting their photos taken outside my room door. My stay was not peaceful or quiet, as I specifically requested to have a room away from the pool and areas where people congregate.",Positive,,,,,
breakfast food was cold. french toast was tough.,Positive,,,,,
I did NOT stay on April 25--I canceled that reservation on April 16 and there is STILL a POS hold on my checking account. I have communicated with multiple people locally and at corporate with ZERO satisfaction.,Negative,,,,,
Very enjoyable,Positive,,,,,
"Noely was great! Welcoming and helpful. Loved the pool, the hot tub and the sauna.",Positive,,,,,
"I love your hotel, I always feel safe as a woman traveling on business.",Positive,,,,,
Very loud the entire night which made it difficult to sleep and stay asleep,Negative,,,,,
I've stayed at alot of hotels and this is is my all time favorite. I have no complaints or improvements.,Positive,,,,,
Beautiful hotel,Positive,,,,,
"Biggest complaint was how filthy the room was  
 A lot of dust and a lot of hair on the floor in the bathroom",Negative,,,,,
I wish I could get a discount or earn free nights for staying there frequently.,Positive,,,,,
Only complaint is paying for the parking (was not expecting it on my bill)  and the gate for exiting the parking lot was not working at times.,Negative,,,,,
We were surprised that the bar/restaurant didn't offer any happy hour specials.,Positive,,,,,
Had a very nice time @ Green Bay Hyatt!  Again thank you to  ULULANI NUNIES for making our welcome so great!,Positive,,,,,
Overall outstanding stay.  I very much appreciate the personal touch from the GM and the extra efforts from the team to make my stay comfortable.,Positive,,,,,
Awesome staff and excellent experience,Positive,,,,,
Bisquits and gravy were gross.,Negative,,,,,
"The Heat in the rooms is evidently not adjustable room by room evemn though there is a thermostat in each room.  The ""between season"" reason for the rooms being cold was not what I would expect from Hyatt",Positive,,,,,
Had to chg rooms due to noisy ac. Thanks to Will for helping with that and moving us to new room. Give him a raise!,Positive,,,,,
Great experience.  The rooms were very nice & the beds were extremely comfortable.,Positive,,,,,
The Che k in staff was friendly and efficient,Positive,,,,,
"The play area in the lobby for kids made a huge statement to us, that this hotel is family friendly. With that and the overall aesthetics of the entire hotel, as well as customer service, we will now be seeking out Hyatt Regencyâ€™s for all hotel stays. No complaints. Thank you.",Positive,,,,,
"Everything was great! We enjoyed our room, the hotel was beautiful! Our kids had a fantastic time at the pool. The only negative thing was the heat didn't work in our room. But besides that loved the hotel and will definitely return to Hyatt anytime we are in greenbay.",Positive,,,,,
Poor air conditioning or not any at all,Negative,,,,,
The Hotel is Beautiful and the rooms are so spacious. We will stay again.,Positive,,,,,
"Lovely room, excellent staff, elevators were extremely slow, parking lot was a challenge",Positive,,,,,
The buffet was not what I was use to from you guys... I stay with you all every time I have a meeting in Green Bay and this was the first time I was disappointed with the food.,Negative,,,,,
"Breakfast buffet was basic, nothing exceptional. Menu had limited items.
If Hyatt was in charge of the food for the Association Dinner Wednesday night, it was terrible.
Overall service and friendly staff was exceptional.",Positive,,,,,
"I was in room 501. The set up in that room is very strange. The beds are right inside the door. The TV is wall mounted and very far from the couch. There is no desk or work station. I've stayed at this Hyatt before and was very impressed with the facility and the room, but I would not want to stay in 501 again.",Positive,,,,,
Food on breakfast buffet needs to be warmer,Positive,,,,,
"Bathrooms were okay, they should be remodeled with walk-in tiled showers. No one who stays in a hotel takes a â€œtub.â€ Save the tubbing for the pool or the hot tub suites.",Positive,,,,,
"Air was not working in room, very warm to sleep.",Positive,,,,,
"There was a problem with my thermostat. The fan continued to blow cold air and would not shut off. I had to contact the front desk and have a tech manually shut it off.
I was given a very small space heater to keep the room warm. Not my idea of a pleasant hotel experience. I'm somewhat disappointed.",Negative,,,,,
My key card was not working and a staff member was walking by at the time.  She stopped to help us into our room and offered to have a new key brought up.  It was wonderful customer service - thank you!,Positive,,,,,
Danielle is a gem. Very professional and friendly.,Positive,,,,,
I had a cocktail in the restaurant. It was very good. I didn't enjoy the shampoo and conditioner in the hotel.,Positive,,,,,
"The staff was super friendly and helpful, especially Kira and Max (food service).",Positive,,,,,
food under WHCA,Positive,,,,,
The room is large and well kept and Noely was friendly yet professional.,Positive,,,,,
Drinks at Breakfast were late and almost halfway done with each meal by the time I received my drinks.,Positive,,,,,
"I no longer live in Green Bay but did from 2011 to 2016. When I first arrived here (for work, WPS project) this was the first place I stayed during the training process. Loved the location then and love it now. Beautiful hotel, nice rooms and great location. Since moving away I've visited the Green Bay area many times to visit friends and would stay with those friends. After my recent visit, which was great and convenient, I may just stay at the hotel during future visits. I love Green Bay. The city is truly one of America's hidden gems.",Positive,,,,,
"The bed was terrible, no free breakfast.",Positive,,,,,
Great stay again...only real complaint is the tiny toilets in this hotel. They are seriously too short and small for an average adult.,Negative,,,,,
"Sad shortage of outlets in rooms. 
Starbucks barista could use some support. 
Thank you for providing my husband a toothbrush when he forgot his.
Very considerate staff and clean room.",Positive,,,,,
There should be a continental breakfast.  You shouldnâ€™t have to pay.  My husband had a small bowl of oatmeal and my kids barely ate their eggs and we were charged 20+ dollars.  Very disappointing.  Otherwise we loved it.,Negative,,,,,
The breakfast buffet is a little expensive.  Cost more than the GSA per diem for meal reimbursement from my employer.  The temperature in my room never got warmer than 68 degrees and the fan ran and ran all the time.,Positive,,,,,
"Disappointed that the breakfast buffet did not start until 7:00 am. If hot not possible, at least a continental breakfast would be nice",Negative,,,,,
Our room was on the second floor right above the breakfast buffet.  They started pushing out carts full of dishes around 5am that was really noisy.,Positive,,,,,
"""No outside food in the pub"", but the pub's kitchen is closed. Dumbest rule ever. Rethink customer service opportunity here...",Positive,,,,,
The lady's at the front counter are very unpleasant  and rude.  Thank God for marlo he was excellent. I was charged for parking when they left the gates up all weekend starting Wednesday  upon arrival.   Getting towles and washcloths was a nightmare the towel hanger was broken had to wait almost 2 hours for hot water.  No this trip we were all very dissatisfied  with room sand the guest we brought with us  the elevators were over ran by the children staying thier. Waited over thirty minutes had to take the stairs from the 8th and 5th floor.  Up and down the staff had no control over the whole process. Now we have been staying here for many years when we visit  this was by far the worst 5 days we have spent at the Hyatt green bay.  Called down to let them know and the response was  well we told you kids were here. As a leader. In a leadership role you need to have trained staff to avoid chaos in these situations   to accommodate all guest  and not with childish responses so no. At this point I am very perturbed and dissatisfied .you may also call me at 305-780-3745.  As I have been with the Hyatt for over 13 years when it was the gold program.,Negative,,,,,
"I was so disappointed in the service received during breakfast buffet. Getting hot water for tea was ridiculous- so slow or nonexistent. You had to flag down staff if you wanted something. I am still waiting for the salt shaker I asked for. Very poor service also in the Pub. No one to seat us. When we did get seated we had to go up to the bar to ask how to order or get a drink. Stairwells are very poorly marked to get out in an emergency. You are forced to use the elevators and they are super slow . Rooms are absolutely wonderful, spacious, and clean and have all the amenities you would need. There should be a sign in the bathroom telling you to all the front desk if you need a blow dryer though. By the time you figure out there is not one there, it is frustrating to wait for staff to deliver it to you when you have wet hair and arenâ€™t dressed yet.",Negative,,,,,
Pricing of food and beverage higher than average comparables.,Positive,,,,,
Room heat was not working effectively so the room was just a little colder than I would have liked,Positive,,,,,
"Beautiful rooms, I hope to stay again.",Positive,,,,,
Food in the restaurant was terrible and portions were small.,Positive,,,,,
"I stayed for a convention and the meeting rooms were so cold that no one could concentrate.  The bar was the worst service ever, not enough staff.  The restaurant food was horrible and way over priced for the quantity and quality.  We were in Green Bay!!",Negative,,,,,
"Stayed in 531, every night sounded like someone was stomping on the floor (my ceiling), running around. Having to spend three consecutive days in intense, full-day meetings, this noise wasn't conducive to a good night's sleep.",Positive,,,,,
There was a snowstorm and I needed help getting to my car.  The security guard was amazing. He walked me out and helped me clear off the car.  He also retrieved my luggage and helped make sure my windshield was clear for my 5 hour drive home.  He did it with a cheerful attitude and didn't hesitate when I said I needed help to get to the car since I was a fall risk.  This was a Spring storm and shame on me - no boots or coat.  I have stayed here many times but he really went above and beyond. I wish I could remember his name - tall with dark brown hair.,Positive,,,,,
Bartenders are very slow and hard to get their attention for service and the bar wasnt that busy.,Negative,,,,,
"Only thing I didnâ€™t like, was out of three couples that stayed there, we were the only one that got charged $7 for parking. When we came back to the hotel for the night, the parking lot was full so they told us to park across the street. We did so and asked if we were still going to get charged for parking since we couldnâ€™t park there, and we were.  The other 2 couples we were with didnâ€™t get charged.",Positive,,,,,
"Very dissatisfied, I checked in the hotel at 6:30pm, limited front desk staff and very unprofessional...chatting with other while quests waiting to check in the hotel.

I got to my room (#803) and the fan for the heating and cooling unit was on high and the room temperature was 67.6 degrees. I tried to adjust the temperature and it was not working...I called the front desk at 8:30pm and was told maintenance was going to visit my room to assist. At 9:15pm I called the front desk to follow up my request, front desk clerk (same person-male, I did not get name) told me he would get with maintenance again and have them visit my room...at 9:40pm, front desk clerk (same person all 3 times-male) told me: ""Maintenance had shut off the boilers and the room temperature may raise slightly, however, if I wanted, the hotel would provide me with a ""space heater"", I declined since I did not want to keep getting up during the night to adjust the temperature...


The following morning I went to shower and no hot water...the front desk was not very helpful with this request either...they offered to comp my breakfast? How was comping my breakfast going to help me with a hot shower...very inexperienced and unprofessional hotel staff.

I found my experience at my recent stay at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay to be very frustrating and unsatisfying...I will not patronize this location on future visits to Green Bay, WI.

Best regards,

"Heating/cooling in room did not work.  I adjusted thermostat but room temp did not change.  
Front desk individual was not very friendly - kind of blah.
Breakfast buffet was fantastic.
FBLA conference taking place at the same time as I was there.  I was not aware.  Kids were wild, not controlled, very loud late into the night.  I think you need better control of large groups of high school students - chaperones need to be more on top of their kids.",Positive,,,,,
A great visit for a conference and I slept well both nights. Thanks!,Positive,,,,,
"The rooms need a remodel; they are the exact same as when I stayed over 10 years ago. The bathroom had no vent or fan so showering steamed the bathroom unusable while getting ready. The bathrooms are extremely small, you could use some of the space for the living and bedroom area and expand the bathrooms. The food at the conference was lack luster-even by conference food standards, lukewarm, or overly salty. The only highlight was the cheesecake. At check in, the staff had no idea about parking in the city parking structure across the street. If you are going to recommend parking there due to space issues, know the answers to these questions. Not what I expect from a Hyatt at all.",Positive,,,,,
"We were at this hotel for the State Basketball Tournament that this hotel chose to host.  There were many teams staying at the hotel.  We were continually spoken to and yelled at for congregating in the lobby - even though there are a TON of spots to sit down there.  None of the groups in the lobby were loud or out of hand by any means, but the management told us we could not eat in the lobby or sit at the tables. They made us clear out our stuff at 9 pm as those were their ""quiet hours"" even though the pool hours went later and again, none of the families or groups from all the programs were disruptive.  We were very unsatisfied with how we were treated.  We feel this hotel should understand when they host a tournament like this, that teams are looking for places to have a group gathering and that it will be busy and crowded and may get a little loud at times - even though it really never did.  We loved the decor of the hotel, the pool, and rooms, but may never come back due to the management!",Positive,,,,,
Breakfast staff is slow.  Hotel is old.,Positive,,,,,
Our heater never went past 70Â° and it was cold at times but we managed. Room 512. Only complaint in our 3 night stay.,Negative,,,,,
I only stayed as part of a conference.  The room was clean but was in poor shape and in need of maintenance in several areas.  I also considered staying an additional day after the conference but decided not to based on the astronomical price for the room.,Positive,,,,,
"The food was subpar, the heat in the room did not work - it was extremely cold night and day.",Negative,,,,,
Air conditioning in room did not work.,Positive,,,,,
"Was not a friendly reception at check in..not informative to hotel activities,hours,etc. Also the pool room was a mess for the adult hour..ppl were using their vapors in the pool..elevators extremely slow..housekeeping would get on with carts making people with families and children and luggage wait or squeeze in crowded..why don't they have their own elevator..guests should be first.plus breakfast was gross..burnt omelets..poorly stocked at busy hours..waited to be say while staff talking..was actually told to go wait .Again poor guest service.",Negative,,,,,
"everything was fabulous, except housekeeping came earlier than we requested on our second day, the pool and hot tube were colder than expected.",Positive,,,,,
"I have attended a many conferences, Leslie and her staff (Jess in catering) were amazing, checking on us multiple times a day.  The app was awesome too - The chef and assistant also came out the first and 2nd day of conference to check on things too!  AMAZING.  Then like a dope I left my winter coat in my room after checking out, it was brought out to me within 2 minutes.  Thank you HYATT - going to recommend we start going to Hyatt's for all conferences.",Positive,,,,,
"Marlo was awesome: he gave me a specific tourist recommendation that I took and really enjoyed. 
Also, the breakfast beat expectations and was well worth the 12.95 + tip. Your spread was comprehensive with lots of protein, perfect after a morning run on the Green Bay Road historic path.",Positive,,,,,
The hot tub and pool needed attention. There were towels everywhere dirty and none clean and the hot tub was very cold. Not relaxing at all. Also the staff was allowing other guests vape in the pool area that was quite unacceptable. We ended up only being down there 15 minutes and just had enough.,Negative,,,,,
"There was a loud fan in the vent in the room that was kind of annoying, but I dealt with it",Negative,,,,,
"After checking in and entering the room, I noticed it was quite warm. I set the thermostat to a much lower temperature and after ten minutes the fan was not running; no cooling was taking place.  I went to the front desk and told Emma I did not think it was cooling. Emma described how to set the temperature lower, which I had done (I work in a technical field and know how to operate a thermostat). I told her I had done this and nothing was happening, she sternly replied, ""Set it lower and it WILL work.""  She made it clear she would not be helpful in this regard. I also asked about being assigned to a different room, which she was not able to do.  No cooling took place int her room during the first 48 hours of my occupancy.  Around midnight on the third night, the air conditioning began working and cooled the room. I believe Emma is not aware of the maxim of customer service that the customer is always right.",Positive,,,,,
"All staff were very good.  The room was great, best room I have ever stayed in.  I also like the warm temperature of the pool.",Positive,,,,,
There was barely enough toilet paper for one night for two people. Both of the gentleman working the front desk were useless and somewhat arrogant.,Negative,,,,,
"I arrived early and my checkin went something like this:  

Hyatt Green Bay
Me: Iâ€™m early, any chance my room is ready
Desk Clerk: no rooms, it is too early to put you on the list, we donâ€™t want you to wait, so check back in an hour.

Desk clerk: okay, Iâ€™ll put you on the list

"Very comfy bed, spacious rooms.  Thank you.",Positive,,,,,
"Bathroom was small, and had no vent. However the room was spacious and very clean. overall stay was nice.",Positive,,,,,
"The staff was very nice and accommodating.  One of the housekeepers left a note on my mirror that said, look good, feel good, have a nice day.  When I returned back to my hotel room and saw that it made me smile.  Its little things like that which can make a hotel experience that much better.  I was there for a work conference, but the hotel made it a relaxing stay.  Thank you.",Positive,,,,,
"We were not very happy with the parking situation.  The gates didnâ€™t work half the time and one of the 2 nights we had to drive around for at least 20 minutes until a parking spot opened up.  And you charge extra for that ???   Thatâ€™s ridiculous.  
Very happy with all other parts of the stay.",Positive,,,,,
Staff were friendly and accommodating to my needs.,Positive,,,,,
"Appreciate keeping the rates low so Iâ€™m reluctant to ask for changes but... the toilets need improvement (prone to clogging), the bathrooms need fans, the bar area could use a mild upgrade from the thin poster board.  It would make a world of difference with these upgrades.  But again thank you for the low prices",Positive,,,,,
Your staff is very polite and accomodating! I forgot my water bottle in my room as the door was closing after check out and the cleaning person was AWESOME and let me in to retrieve it. I also left my validated parking pass w/ the key in my room and the front desk rep was very kind and buzzed me out.,Positive,,,,,
A little bit noisy by elevator,Negative,,,,,
This is an awesome hotel and we will be staying here again in the future. Very satisfied experience.,Positive,,,,,
"Only complaint is that with elevators being slow, having an option to use stairs would be nice.",Negative,,,,,
"Heat in our original room wouldnâ€™t work.  Fan was blowing (extremely loud), but no heat.  We had thermostat set on 72 and it wouldnâ€™t get above 68 degrees in the room.  Called down to front desk, we were told someone would come up and that we could have a space heater if we would like.  Space heaters are dangerous and I didnâ€™t pay that much money to heat my room with a space heater. An hour later, I went down to front desk because we hadnâ€™t seen anyone yet.  Again, he said he would send someone up.  Still, after probably another hour, no one came.  I finally called down to desk again and asked for another room.  We were finally moved to a new room (after my suggestion) and it seemed like everything was going to be ok...until the max temp of that new room was only 69 degrees.  At least the fan was fairly quiet in the new room, so we knew it shouldnâ€™t keep us awake all night.  We were so tired at that point, that we just went to bed so we could at least be under the blankets for more warmth.  The woman at the desk the next morning, when we checked out, was very apologetic about the situation.",Positive,,,,,
"We stay at the Hyatt for dance competitions. Very accommodating to my requests for a quiet room on a lower floor for my son who has special needs. However, this stay was not enjoyable and I left very unhappy. I called to the front desk at 11pm to let them know our heat was blowing cold air. She told me that it was in between seasons and she would have security turn off the fans. I asked how the room would stay warm and her reply was to send up a space heater. The executive suite is a large room and a space heater would not heat the room. Also I donâ€™t use space heaters, ever. The thermostat read 60 degrees by 6am. The room started to warm up slightly once the sun came out. At one point I had to turn the shower on and let the hot water run with the bedroom door open to get some warmth in the room. The heat should have been fixed immediately or we could have been switched to a different room. I voiced my concerns very politely at check out and was given an apology. Not satisfied at all. If we would not have had so many enjoyable stays previously I donâ€™t think we would be coming back. We are back in May so hopefully the room temperature heating/cooling issue will be fixed.",Positive,,,,,
I don't think it is appropriate to charge the fee for parking when we had to park a mile away,Positive,,,,,
Waffles were hard and not hot.,Negative,,,,,
"The hotel room and hotel overall was a little dated. The bathtub filled with water when in the shower, even when the drain was open.",Neutral,,,,,
"Our blankets were dirty, our room temperature would not raise over 70, and our breakfast was cold. When asked for items to have coffee in our room, we never recieved them. The staff upon checkout was rude as well. Not pleased.",Positive,,,,,
Very nice.   The bathrooms are a tad small for my preference.,Positive,,,,,
"Our only complaint was our breakfast not Saturday and Sunday... Saturday, the waffles and sausage links were extremely dry! Even syrup didnâ€™t help the waffles. Sunday, the biscuits were dry and the sausage gravy for the biscuits tasted unbelievably burnt!! It gave it such a terrible taste!! I was very surprised that it was even out on the buffet! Clearly, no one tried it before bringing it out! We do LOVE all the options that are offered with the breakfast buffet!",Negative,,,,,
"In regards to the buffet, the waffles and pancakes we're cold. And every time someone got up a service member would clear our table even though half the time we seriously JUST got the food...... It actually became a running joke with us.. but the waste of food has to e compounded with this issue.",Positive,,,,,
"Disappointed that you no longer provide a continental breakfast or even prices comparable. Everything cost money, ie parking, and prices for food court were costly.",Positive,,,,,
"Housekeeping left my room door open after cleaning on Saturday. I came back to room open.  I was offered a food credit as an apology.  In looking through my room to make sure all of our things were still there, I found used underwear from a previous guest under the desk.  I was staying with group who were using numerous other rooms so we decided to order food at the hotel as I needed to eat there to use my food credit.  We all ordered pizzas to share as a group and the two pizzas I ordered were almost black on top so I had to return for replacement but the replacements did not come until the rest of our group was done eating which was ackward.  Then Saturday we decided to use the sofa bed so my kids could have their own area and in doing so found all kinds of garbage on the floor in the sofa bed (very noticeable..anyone cleaning or inspecting could not have accidentally missed it-wrappers, bottle caps, etc.)   I have stayed here previously and not had this sort of problem.  I have worked in hotel sales for almost 20 years so I understand things happen but this was a bit much for one stay.  The desk attendant Sunday, Danielle, was apologetic and offered half off the 2nd night which was appreciated.",Positive,,,,,
The service in the hotel restaurant/bar was so slow and there was only one other table occupied while we were there!,Negative,,,,,
Question about check-in... having stayed at this property several times my reply was NOT negative. Check-in experience was as good as it has ever been.,Neutral,,,,,
Need bathroom ceiling fans,Positive,,,,,
Excellent price for what we received in room size.,Positive,,,,,
"I would definitely recommend the Hyatt Regency in Green Bay.  The rooms were spacious, the meeting rooms was great as was the meeting catering.  Overall, the experience was very good.  I do have one issue to share.  On the first day of our program, a handful of our participants commented that their alarm clocks went off in the morning, even though they had not set them.  There were at least three people telling this same story after the first night at the hotel.  I did not have the same problem and chalked it up to circumstance or perhaps a group of guests playing a prank when they left.  However, on the second day, I had the same experience.  My alarm went off very early in the morning, and I had not set it - had not even touched it.  That does seem a bit suspect and we couldn't help but wonder if it wasn't previous guests, but perhaps the hotel staff that was setting the clocks.  Either way, it frustrated some of our meeting participants.  (And made them a little nervous about what other surprises may have been done by the staff.)  This would not stop me from returning to the hotel, but I felt it was worth mentioning.  These little things can really impact perceptions.",Negative,,,,,
Great customer service at front desk and room was super clean. Good job!,Positive,,,,,

"We enjoyed our stay, but were a little disappointed when we checked in and were then told that parking was $7 per night.  I don't remember seeing that on your website.  Warm chocolate chip cookies along with fresh coffee waiting for guests checking would have been a nice touch.  Even many of the ""lower-end establishments already offer those things.  Those little things make a big difference.  My husband and I would have loved to have eaten breakfast at your hotel.  When we asked about it. The price and kind of guest deal was being offered, the check-in person gave us a whole $1.00 off as your ""best deal"".   It was very offensive. Quite frankly, breakfast should always be included with every stay.  It should never be offered only through ""certain package deals"". When I inquired about those, we were told that there were no more of those packages available.    Exactly how does that work? Some get it and some don't?  Quite frankly that is a deal breaker for us.  Then, we were looking for what to do in the area....the casino, restaurants, coupons, etc.  There was absolutely nothing in our room.  Not only that, But we were looking for some incentives to eat at your restaurant and have few drinks.
Again there was nothing.  I remember when your hotel was the Embassy Suites.  Breakfast was always included
Along with a happy hour social with drink tickets and hourdervrs.  Those kinds of things kept people at your establishment.  I am truly not sure if we would stay with you again because of those points.  They always say that it's in the details.  We think you have a long way to go.",Positive,,,,,
We enjoyed our second stay here. My only complaint is the coffee at the breakfast buffet was awful. Tasted like it sat way too long.,Positive,,,,,
Heat in room did not work. Co worker in separate room had same problem.,Negative,,,,,

Bathroom sink was clogged and not attractive to look @,Negative,,,,,
"the lampshades in the bedroom room 719 are damaged and need to be replaced. there are spots on the wall in the bedroom that are bare and need to be touched up with paint. the cleaning staff took the floor bath mat after our first night stay and didn't replace it with another for our second night stay.  the cleaning staff took my food that i was saving on the counter and threw it away during room clean up after our first night stay (i was really, really looking forward to eating it!). the coffee and water provisions were really appreciated! the bed was incredibility comfortable and had the best night sleep that i can recall! (would like to duplicate it at home, are they for sale?! really!!). the morning breakfast staff were very friendly and accommodating! was impressed and thankful that hotel security/staff enforced the ""adults only"" after 10p in the swimming/hot tub area! the peace and quiet was lovely. will come back!",Positive,,,,,
Breakfast food was cold.,Positive,,,,,
HVAC system was stuck at about 70 degrees.  I keep my house at 66 in the summer and 63 at night in the winter.  It was too warm.  Every bathroom vent van in the nation at almost every hotel seems to be broken these days and not just yours but yours is too.,Negative,,,,,
"Stay was great.  Heater fan was very noisy in the room.  Our room was overbooked for the weekend so they gave us an ""upgrade"" which was fine except the kids ended up sleeping on a very very uncomfortable pull out couch for 2 nights:(   Friday night we had kids running all aroind the entire floor and hitting our door and window until 1 in the morning.  Which is mostly many parents fault not the hotels but it was a bit ridiculous.",Negative,,,,,
We were very disapointed after we arrived and ordered pizza. We were swimming with our kids and wanted to eat our pizza in the pool area. The lady at the front desk told us we could not eat in there so we dicided to eat in the lobby area just outside the pool. The table were disgustingly dirty and covered with food pieces. I asked the lady at the front counter if we could get these cleaned off and she promptly told us we could not eat there either and said we had to go back to our room to eat our pizza. If you want people to come back you need to accomidate them. For thiscreason we will not be back to this hotel!,Positive,,,,,
I think the non refundable pet fee is quite high.   My puppy was in his cage at all times when we left the room.   Someone always in the room when we let him out.  We took him out several times to avoid any accidents which there were none.   I can understand charging some kind of fee but again 100 is pretty outrageous.   Thank you,Negative,,,,,
Great,Positive,,,,,

The room service did not knock and walked on me and my wife... we did not get the room we booked. We woke up to our neighbor peeing... they did comp our room but it was still a poor experience.,Negative,,,,,
Was not aware that the Hyatt does not take personal checks anymore. Wish I would have known ahead of time as it frees up my cash. Kolton was very apologetic and kind when I said I wasn't told and had wished I'd known.,Positive,,,,,
"I marked our check-in a â€œworse than expectedâ€ only because we had 4 room cards programmed, went up to our room on the 7th floor, tried every key in every which way in the door and not a one worked.

"There was a lot of confusion about the room rate and what was included. Also, I booked with another family and they received a much better rate than we did.",Positive,,,,,
"Staff not helpful at all for my colleague who was using oxygen and a wheelchair.  She was not offered assistance by staff upon check or check out. The menu at Pub333 is pretty limited as well and does not offer much for those with dietary restrictions aside from salad.  ALSO, the lunches served at the conference were mediocre at best. Multiple people noted the 3 days lunch as being of really poor quality.",Positive,,,,,

Can I have someone pick up the things I left in my room?,Neutral,,,,,
"The parking is limited and the overflow is a long ways away for carrying your luggage. My room was horrible. The mold and mildew made my asthma react. After an hour in the room, I requested a different room. I felt as though it was an inconvenience for them. Desk person acted as though I was making it up. He was slow to respond. They brought no luggage cart to move things to new room. By then I didnâ€™t care anymore and just needed to get a different room. 2nd room has much better. Air was good. No mold and mildew smell.",Negative,,,,,
"Heat only got to 64 degrees. Brought me a heater the size of my one cup coffee maker. Wish there was a refund policy on hotels. If it wasnâ€™t for group hotel booking, would have used my Hilton gold benefits elsewhere. Food was subpar with bones in walleye, still frozen cake, and undercooked rice. I travel a lot and never have complaints, but this was an overpriced Motel 6.",Positive,,,,,
We thought it was odd that there were no tissues in the room.,Negative,,,,,
The menu in the room for room service only had 4 items to choose from so most of us had to leave to get a nice meal.,Positive,,,,,
"I did not have an enjoyable stay! The toilet ran the whole first night. It didn't get fixed by second night so they moved me. My room was never restocked with towels or shampoo and I had to call for those items twice before finally receiving.  Third night I was woke up early in the morning by some sort of maintenance work next door. I am supposed to come for another Opioids Forum the first week in April. I am hesitant to book a room for 3 nights again there. I would love for you to comp my room for the April stay to win back my loyalty. Please have a manager reach out to me asap!

My room was not clean as I would have expected it to be.,Positive,,,,,
I had to have housekeeping take care of something in the room which they did promptly and very courteously.  Later that evening I closed the curtains and there were stains.  I'm not sure why they would be there if someone had checked the room before I arrived.  I was too tired at that point to call so I just slept in the bed farthest from the window.,Positive,,,,,

By the time we got back we noticed it was a little warm and reset the thermostat again. We woke up sweating and I got very sick. When I told the front desk, I was informed the air is not turned on yet and I should have asked for a fan. I missed a day of my conference and was basically told it was my fault.",Negative,,,,,

Appreciated the night lights under the bedside table and the sanitizing wipe for the remote control, both were a nice touch not found in other properties.",Positive,,,,,
"It would be helpful if during the check-in process, you let your guests know there is an additional $25 hold charge added to your credit card until you check-out & the bills processes through your bank. This was not communicated & when I saw the additional charge added to my bill I had to call today to find out why I had an additional charge.",Positive,,,,,
"Breakfast is disappointing - flavorless, rubbery eggs with some green something sprinkled on them. Overcooked, over-peppered potatoes. Call the local burn unit to pick up the bacon, or call the local waste hauler to vacuum up the grease off the sausages. Messy, disorganized oatmeal, cereal and fruit. No condiments or additions for â€¦ well, anything. How about some shredded cheese, cream cheese, bacon bits â€¦ anything to spice up the mess that is breakfast. Beverage choices include watered down fruit juice and warm milk. And then to only offer the breakfast to rewards members? Outrageous - you get a better breakfast, offered to all guests, at cheaper hotels.",Negative,,,,,
A great facility with a very well trained and polite staff.  A pleasure to stay with you again!,Positive,,,,,
The check-in lady for the breakfast buffet was very hard to understand. She asked us if we had a ticket? We did not but then she didnâ€™t explain you could go ahead and eat and then check out when youâ€™re done eating. It was very confusing. We almost didnâ€™t eat because of it but found out the food was fabulous. If the communication issue was taken care of it wouldâ€™ve been perfect.,Positive,,,,,

"I understand your hotel had issues due to previous group messing up a bunch of rooms. Telling us ""Its a busy weekend, you will have to checkin several hours past time without any return compensation, is unacceptable"" You had a full hotel, you made money, and I assume the previous group that trashed the rooms, you charged extra for and made more. Telling us to tough it, now how you bring people back.",Negative,,,,,

All three kids chicken tenders were dry and disgusting.  My friend had steak and 30 minutes after eating it  felt sick to his stomach. The managers offered us dessert.  I found that unacceptable.  Basically I had  30 dollar bill for nothing.  The Eggs were not fully cooked for breakfast and 2 people at our table ended up with diarrhea.",Negative,,,,,

Our room had no window. Is that in accordance with fire code?,Negative,,,,,
"During the stay I was suffering with a cold. So to have a room that could not have the temperature changed was not well. The loudness of the room heater was loud and disrupted sleep most every time is cycled and eventually the first night I slept on the sofa. On the second night, when I arrived in the room, the heater unit would not shut down, running constantly. Contacted the front desk for assistance, and the only thing offered would be to completely shut it off. That night I simply closed to the bedroom area and slept again on the sofa. Finally in the morning the unit shut off. But the room was no where to be considered 'warm'.
Meals: used the morning breakfast buffet; the first morning I noticed that the scrambled eggs were just 'warm' at best. The hash browns were also on the cool side. Butter was very hard and made it a challenge to spread on the toast. The second morning I went for the hash browns, pancakes and bacon. The hash browns were past cool to being simply cold as were the pancakes which of course could not melt that rock hard butter. The bacon at best was barely warm. Coffee however was fine.
The Breakout Conference Hall was chilly and several attendees wore sweaters or jackets.
Nice looking, clean facility, but wasn't that warm fuzzy feeling. 
Upon check out, the desk clerk was gracious and provided a discount for the room and meal. Thank you for that.",Positive,,,,,
"I brought a youth basketball team to the high school state tournament as I have done for several years always staying at the Hyatt Regency.  The front desk people are fantastic and are always polite and willing to help. However, this year i took the group of 8th grade girls for breakfast at the buffet in the Hyatt.  Was willing to pay full price for each girl as I knew the food was very good.  Was shocked when I received the bill and there was a 22% service charge added.  I explained to the server that the money comes from our youth organization and every dime goes to the kids and the service charge seemed excessive. She took the message back to her supervisor who said he/she would not remove the charge.  I paid the entire bill and then took the issue to the front desk explaining the same situation.  The front desk person remedied the situation immediately.",Positive,,,,,
Keep the service quality,Neutral,,,,,
"was noisy after 10 pm, due to high school basketball kids.  Did not like that I needed to bring in parking ticket for ""validation"" for free parking.",Positive,,,,,
"Overall my experience was wonderful. Only issue I didnâ€™t not like was the same time that I stayed there, there was a girls basketball tournament or event and the girls were all over the place, running up and down halls, and making the elevator stop on every floor when others were trying to use it. As I donâ€™t mind children nor that they were all over, I didnâ€™t not like the fact that I couldnâ€™t even go swimming my first night because there were so many people in the pool and it was unsafe for me to bring my child swimming. I would have preferred the hotel to inform me that there was a group that already booked for the same time. Or at lest told me when I checked it, I might have gone else where. Also the elevator were very slow, even the following two days the wait for the elevator was still a while. I also didnâ€™t like the parking situation. I did not know I had to pay to park there every night I was there, and if I couldnâ€™t find a parking spot in the main space I had to park across the street, as I normally wouldnâ€™t mind but when trying to carry a sleeping toddler from the parking garage to my room is a hassle while trying to carry in my luggage.",Positive,,,,,
"Our room was a little warm for our preference but we could not turn down the thermostat.  I texted the # on the card given us at check in with our key cards and received a response that it would be looked into.   When we returned to our room on the 2nd evening, we still were not able to turn down the thermostat.",Positive,,,,,
To be honest I was disappointed in my stay. I brought a friend there for his birthday just to get away and have a relaxing weekend. I won a gift certificate at my work Christmas party and was really looking forward to my stay. I wish I would have been informed when I called for a reservation that there were several things happening on the weekend and that there would be a lot of people staying there.  I have a child and love kids but we didn't use the pool or hot tub because there were a lot of kids in it during our stay. I was also told check in was at 3:00pm. We arrived shortly after 4:00pm and were told we would have to wait 30 to 90 minutes to be able to get in to our room. I was disappointed in the wait and the amount of people staying at the hotel. Had I known it was such a busy weekend we would have picked a different weekend to stay. I know my employer has given gift certificates for this hotel previously and am reluctant to them about my experience. I wish I had positive things to say about my stay but unfortunately I don't.,Positive,,,,,
"Room wasnâ€™t ready until after 4, and then I got something different I believe, otherwise why would you give a senior a room with no hand rails.
No hand rails in tub. Iâ€™m a senior citizen, and I could of used those to hold onto.
A bit noisy even after 10pm.
I think in general, the hotel needs updating.",Positive,,,,,

very clean hotel Very good food.Great experience,Positive,,,,,
The only downfall to our stay as we had no control over the heat. Our room never got below 73Â° and we had the door to the patio open and they had to bring us a fan. To not be able to control the temperature in a room is very disappointing.,Negative,,,,,

"Our bed sheets had big brown stains on them. The room was very hot, we tried to turn down the heat but that wasn't working. There was no Fan setting on the thermostat to try to help with the hot room.",Negative,,,,,
The parking was atrocious.  With the parking area not fully plowed out many cars parked consumed two parking spaces which eliminated about 25% of the parking spaces.  Plus the entrance and exit gates were not working so no parking fees were applied and the lot ended being free parking for everyone.  I did bring this to the attention at checkout and the clerk acted like they cared less.,Positive,,,,,
"Loved the hotel but the bar was a disaster...I waited at least 15 minutes --maybe 20 -- for someone to even acknowledge me and then was told to wait again, to get two glasses of wine. Most of the time I was waiting there was no one behind the bar at all but servers kept passing by. I was with a large group of adults and kids that wanted food at different times and everyone said the same thing...super long waits. My only other issue would be the $7 charge for parking. Why should I have to pay to park? And shouldn't that be noted at the time of reservation or on the confirmation email? Otherwise, all your staff was lovely...my room was large, comfy and in beautiful condition...the kids loved the pool...that little shop across from the entry was super convenient. All good! Thanks!",Positive,,,,,

The steam room and the hot tub are one of the main reasons we pick the Hyatt, it is disappointing when theyâ€™re not working properly.",Positive,,,,,
"We waited well over an hour for food and there werenâ€™t that many people in the restaurant. Could hear lobby noise in our room which kept our children up and then the heating unit was rather loud when it kicked on throughout the night too. Then we forgot an item and when we called to make sure it had been found werenâ€™t helped until we called back and forced the issue (we had been transferred to a voicemail and had a friend leaving the hotel soon, so needed to know if our item had been found so they could take it for us)",Positive,,,,,

We enjoyed our stay very much.  The only thing in our room that was not 100% was that the door if our mini fridge kept opening,Positive,,,,,
"We appreciated the size and amenities in the room.  However, it was miserably hot in our room our entire stay.  Turning the thermostat down did absolutely nothing. This was the case in almost every room on our floor as we stayed as a team for a hockey tournament and everyone was complaining about it.  Staff was kind enough to bring a fan to our room, but it seems odd that you would need a fan in the middle of February.  Also, I do not think the parking lot was monitored closely enough. On the weekends, the gate was up and it seemed anyone could park there, which meant paying guests could not use the lot b/c it was full.  Breakfast was delicious, but I would not have paid the $12.50 cost if it hadn't been included in our rate.  There are many nice hotels who offer a complimentary breakfast these days. Front desk staff was very nice and helpful.  Cleaning was prompt as well.",Positive,,,,,

Very loud.  This was my second time staying here in the last 6 mo. (The first time was with a group of friends-this time a getaway for my spouse and I)- very disappointed by the volume and noise traveling from the atrium area.  I thought it was a fluke on the first trip.  Would have a hard time recommending.,Negative,,,,,
"I enjoyed the room except the room temperature remained at 75 degrees all weekend and we couldn't get it to go down.  I was also given the room of another person and walked into the already occupied room.  I was given another room and then the key didn't work.  I had to make multiple trips down to get in my room, which was a little annoying.  The staff were super apologetic and gave me a $15 credit at the market; however, the maintenance should be improved from the engineering standpoint.",Positive,,,,,
"Amazing experience.  Carrie, reservations manager, worked efficiently to fix a pricing mistake so it would not affect our hockey team as the mistake was on party of the Hyatt.  We were delivered a gift of cookies and milk on Friday night.  It was a nice surprise.  Breakfast was delicious.  The free room that was given to us to hang out in was wonderful.  The beds were amazingly comfortable.  I would highly recommend!!!",Positive,,,,,
We waited an hour after ordering for our food at lunch on Saturday.  Our dinners and breakfast buffet were very good.,Positive,,,,,

"Only bad thing is that the elevators were SO SLOW.  I know there were lots of people at the hotel this weekend, however, I was on the 2nd level, and if there were at least a flight of stair to that level to the main lobby area, it could relieve some of the wait times.",Positive,,,,,
"There was a convention going on while I was staying at your hotel.  Unfortunately, the group was extremely loud on Monday evening.  I called the front desk to ask that they say something to them since I couldn't go to sleep due to the noise.  Again I had to call the front desk at 2:00 AM after the noise level never changed and I was still unable to sleep.  I stay frequently in hotels and had a great experience in the past, however; after no sleep with the 2 calls made I decided to pack up and go to another hotel for the rest of my stay.",Negative,,,,,
"This may have been a fluke...  one of our conference lunches - so this is catered - was so awful.  It was turkey, gravy, mashed potatoes, sitting on a piece of white wonder bread; bad flavor, no veggie or salad.  Otherwise, okay.  I am a picky and healthy eater.",Negative,,,,,

"Good:  great breakfast buffet, spacious rooms, liked the sanitizer wipes for the remote controls
Needs improvement:  mattress and comforter in hide-a-bed had stains on them",Positive,,,,,
Shower in room 707 not very strong water pressure and especially Tuesday AM (2/19/19) not very hot,Negative,,,,,
"Morning Buffet was not as good as in the past. Busy with girls hockey, understandable. Coffee was tasted burnt.. But we will still return.. Comp breakfast for us next time, would be nice.",Positive,,,,,
"Loved the shuttle driver, Steve!",Positive,,,,,
"The staff were congenial and offered to help whether I was at the breakfast buffet, checking in, walking past the desk or in the hallway. When I needed help, they did it immediately and with a smile. There was a huge convention staying in the hotel. I could hear no noise in my suite because the front sitting room must act as a buffer; this is great designing. I will gladly stay here again.",Positive,,,,,
"water was not hot enough
carpet tiles were loose throughout the room",Negative,,,,,
"I checked in after 4pm and my room had not been cleaned. The beds were a mess and there was garbage. When it was cleaned, we did not get fitted sheets, just a normal sheet tucked in between the mattress and box spring. 
I was told when I made the reservation that I was getting a suite with 2 queen beds and a pull out couch. We got the special needs suite with 1 queen bed, 1 queen roll away bed, and a normal couch. Only half of the lights worked on our room. They were plugged in, just would not turn on. 
I have stayed here in years past and I feel like the price is going up but the quality of the hotel is declining.",Positive,,,,,
I've stayed there multiple times so I knew what to expect and it has always been good.,Positive,,,,,
Support staff clearly worked long hours and then returned for early shifts to accommodate needs of large meeting and did so with positivity - great job by the team!,Positive,,,,,
Living room tv slow to turn on.  The whirl pool should have an option to be cooler than 102 degrees. Kids pool sprinkler was a little loud.,Negative,,,,,
I was in Green Bay for a conference. The convention facilities were excellent.  Liked the area outside the restaurant for informal gathering. The food was also excellent and much better than expected. All staff was friendly and helpful.,Positive,,,,,
Outstanding customer service from all employees!,Positive,,,,,
I love this hotel and stay here whenever possible when in Green Bay Area.,Positive,,,,,
Front desk lost an item I wanted picked up by another guest,Negative,,,,,
The food in the bar was pretty good for bar food.  The meals (especially the lunch/dinner options) ranged from ok to unpalatable.  It would be a good idea to improve the quality of the stuff you serve to the attendees of conventions.,Positive,,,,,
Stayed at hotel for a conference.  Conference rooms were spacious.  Audio-visual equipment was in good working order.  Convenience of having large exhibit area in close proximity to meeting rooms was fabulous.,Positive,,,,,
Will be back!!!,Neutral,,,,,
"I had a few problems with the front desk staff - one of the families dropped something off at the front desk for me, and when I went to pick it up, there was no recollection of something being dropped off for me.  Second, we needed 6' or 8' long tables in two of the meeting rooms for our team dinner(s) on Saturday, Feb 16.  It took over 24 hours to get these tables.  We asked on Friday night for them, at 2pm on Saturday, we had to ask 3 more times to get them.  
The only other issue, is that the elevators are super super slow!!!!",Positive,,,,,
"Well to start I got the handicap accessible room!  But need the double queen bed I thought I reserved!  Part of this was my fault, other was him not seeing that we had our kids and realizing that should have or could have changed from single to double queens!  Not coming back to this hotel",Positive,,,,,
"The reservation service was a nightmare.  The woman didn't seem to understand that I wanted to stay two nights.  I think it is ridiculous to charge for parking - how else am I supposed to get to the hotel?  Finally, I was charged tax even though I had a tax exempt number - it took twenty minutes to rectify the situation.  The room was beautiful, although I don't think the thermostat worked.  It was a bit loud - I could hear people upstairs running up and down the hallway.",Negative,,,,,
"Aside from the meal my wife and I had at the 333 on Main (poorly prepared, barely adequate), everything else was exceptional.  Thanks!",Positive,,,,,
Parking was not available in the lot so carrying luggage thru the skywalk to my vehicle was cumbersome as luggage carts were not available. The rest of the stay was comfortable and pleasant.,Positive,,,,,
Everything was perfect. My stay could not have been any better.,Positive,,,,,
"My only complaint was the noise level in the central lobby/bar and hallway areas between 10-midnight.  Fortunately, closing the door between the bedroom and the ""suite"" area of the room significantly reduced it.",Positive,,,,,
"Bed was not comfortable, need some â€œmy pillowsâ€ as yours are not comfortable, traffic noise kept me awake. Counter in bathroom too short with no room for makeup, hair items etc",Positive,,,,,
Always a relaxing experience when staying with you,Neutral,,,,,
Your elevator is unbelievably slow.,Negative,,,,,
"One of the TV remotes did not work, otherwise it was a great suite!",Positive,,,,,
"The beds are comfortable but for people who are short, it would have been good to have a foot stool available. 
It would be nice to get credit on the parking if you stay at the Hyatt.
Thanks for taking care of me during my stay.

Thanks much!",Positive,,,,,
The hot tub and the shower in the hotel room was lukewarm the whole trip.,Negative,,,,,
Awesome place! Staff were so helpful ! Will come again!,Positive,,,,,
"Once again we enjoyed our stay. Dawn, our ""cleaning lady"", was very friendly and kind.",Positive,,,,,
"Danielle at the front desk is the sweetest, most helpful young woman",Positive,,,,,
"The sofa was dirty should get covers if not going to clean. The maid cleaning our room did a great job sorry I didn't get her name I wanted to leave her a tip but couldn't find her before I left pls acknowledged her if you know who she was. My son used one of your wash towels & he broke out in a rash.  your night staff was very helpful got him some cream which helped a little, the following morning your nite staff checked on us sweet, we went to get some oatmeal bath.  While bathing The Shower handle fell off while my son was bathing. the towels were hard if you use vinegar in the rinse will help, loved the amenities, problem kids where in the hot tub couldn't use. love the sauna's. pool was warm nice.  breakfast was very hardy would like if had bananas.  Coffee great.  The Manager Lucaus was very professional & helpful he moved us to another room & they fixed the shower the following morning Great job!   I do love the architecture beautiful design love the court yard feel.  We were snowed in so Tks for the market the pool internet we survived.  FYI no view we requested street view only got the wall in the bed room and roof top in the front room.  Yes I would still come back it was nice.",Positive,,,,,
Need option to turn fan off. It is too loud to sleep. Please remember to clear the alarm clocks after a guest check out.,Positive,,,,,
This was the first time I stayed in this hotel and was very impressed.,Positive,,,,,
I called for early check in and gentleman on the phone was polite and confirmed my room. Danielle was great at check in.,Positive,,,,,
Excellent staff all were very friendly and eager to help.,Positive,,,,,
I love staying there,Positive,,,,,
Wonderful hotel!!! We will definitely be back!!,Positive,,,,,
Best Service and Nice room,Positive,,,,,
"Check in with Emma Lee was a positive experience.  She went out of her way to make me feel welcome.
Tracy Hillesheim greeted me in the morning.  She was inviting and extremely helpful.  She was extremely accommodating and she is the reason why I will be staying at Hyatt Regency Green Bay while I am working in GB.(next 12 weeks), along with a colleague of mine.",Positive,,,,,
"We were very pleased with our stay, the staff was very friendly.  Especially the people at the breakfast area and also the people working by the pool.  The room was very quiet and clean.  Just a very nice stay overall!",Positive,,,,,
"I visit Green Bay frequently, but don't usually need to stay in a hotel. I picked this hotel because it is close to the places we went to visit. I will never stay at another hotel in Green Bay! The staff was so friendly, the entire place is clean and very beautiful. We also had our service dog with us and they were great about it!!",Positive,,,,,
"Why do you have those little refrigerators that are ""coolers?.  Don't understand that, they do nothing.  Put in regular small refrigerators.",Neutral,,,,,
Pleasant experience as always.,Positive,,,,,
The front desk staff and manager were very helpful and friendly.  Great people and nice hotel.,Positive,,,,,
The breakfast buffet was excellent. The lobby and suite were very comfortable.  This is a former Embassy Suite Hotel.  I only wish they had kept the happy hour in the evening.,Positive,,,,,
"The HVAC unit in my room was loud at times and did not seem to heat evenly in the two rooms of the suite. Also, they did not come to try to clean my room until after 6pm. I was gone most of the day and there was ample opportunity for it to be cleaned it may help to make sure rooms that are being occupied for multiple day are cleaned during the day rather than in the evening.",Positive,,,,,
We love it at this hotel and the people that work there are the best,Positive,,,,,
"I really appreciate that there is a restaurant at the hotel (Pub 333)!  I really enjoy adding salmon, chicken or beef on top of a salad.  It's a great way to eat healthy while on a business trip.  I do wish there were some more ""healthy"" food options.  Sometimes the menu options feel a little heavy and greasy--which doesn't feel super great when you're on the go.  Many of the entrees are a little oily, or carb-heavy.

I will say, I always love eating at the restaurant, despite its limited menu because after a long day, going out to eat can be exhausting.  I love being able to call into the restaurant in the lobby and have the food ready for me.  Most of my business trips revolve around going into the P&G plant around the corner.",Positive,,,,,
The breakfast was not as good as my last stay. The pizza from the restaurant was worse than something you could buy in a store.,Positive,,,,,
"The rooms, lobby were so dark and dated.  Very little light
The door room hotel so old there was a gap between bottom and floor",Negative,,,,,
"An excellent value, loved the bedding and the toiletries - very classy.",Positive,,,,,
"1) It would have been helpful to know that there was a parking charge BEFORE being asked for a credit card on file. I would have used my business card if I had known there would be a charge, but instead I gave my personal card, and now have to expense the parking charge. Not a huge deal, but it's more tedious for me to take care of.
2) the fridge in my room (533) did not work, which was disappointing.",Positive,,,,,
Rooms being clean and things working are expected. Itâ€™s not something you should get a plus rating for. I expected more from the Hyatt. The Brand is going downhill.,Positive,,,,,
"Great staff, location and services all well done",Positive,,,,,
The room was good but could have been cleaned a little better. Carpet was not vacuumed very well. I did leave my purse in the room when we checked out and the security and house keeping departments handled it very professionally.,Positive,,,,,
The entire staff was gracious and hardworking. Friendly and always sporting a smile from desk staff to the cleaning personnel. I was very impressed by the entire package.,Positive,,,,,
I had a wonderful time at your establishment. Everything was top notch in my eyes. The room looked better then expect and everone was friendly. Thinking of another trip just so I can stay at you establishment again. ðŸ‘ðŸ¾ðŸ‘ðŸ¾ðŸ‘ðŸ¾ðŸ‘ðŸ¾ðŸ‘ðŸ¾,Positive,,,,,
The rooms were and the pool area was well taken care!! Overall the stay was enjoyable. The staff was also helpful when we needed them.,Positive,,,,,
The drains were slow in room 224. Had to stand in pool of water when showering.,Negative,,,,,
"Mattress uncomfortable, and wife had allergy issues, we think with the pillows.",Negative,,,,,
Thank you - so wonderful!,Positive,,,,,
"Everything was good except the sauna didnâ€™t work.  We were stuck for 2 nights during a snow storm and would have enjoyed a sauna.  The steam room was great. 
The heating fan in our room was loud and sounded like a lawnmower every time it turned on.  Other than that we enjoyed our stay.",Positive,,,,,
Three of us had omeletts made at the buffet and none of us got the proper ingredients that we ordered. Biscuits hard and sausage gravy was terrible. Hardeeâ€™s has better sausage gravy.,Positive,,,,,
"The only questionable thing is I originally had 4 people for our room but 1 person got sick and did not come. When you do pricing on line it changes for each addâ€™l person but when I asked at the desk she said it didnâ€™t matter. When I got home did the same test and yes, it does matter. ðŸ˜¡",Negative,,,,,
"I wish there was a FULL LENGTH mirror in the room. Seriously, it's hard to stand on the edge of the tub to look in the mirror that way (and not safe either).  Towel bars would be super useful also, as there is no where to put hand towels in use. Also, while the layout and amenities are super nice, attention to detail is needed - finishes are worn out in the bar area, and it just looks old and grungy.",Positive,,,,,
The room was very cold,Negative,,,,,
Will be back,Neutral,,,,,
The front part of the room was dark / insufficient lighting.,Negative,,,,,
Bathroom shower could have been cleaner. There were long hairs on the shower wall.,Positive,,,,,
I booked this hotel because I was told the pool was so warm. I took my daughter and my granddaughter there to swim. I was very disappointed because the pool and the pool room was on the cold side.,Negative,,,,,
"My daughter arrived at the hotel a couple hours before we did, and the clerk allowed her to go ahead and get to the room, which was much appreciated.
The hotel was full of fairly young children, and they were running around and very loud. It was difficult to get to sleep on Saturday night because of the amount of noise in the hotel.
The bathroom in our room was very dated and somewhat worn looking. The showerhead could use a good soak in CLR - lots of hard water buildup on there.
The water that came out of the faucet in the bar area was disgusting - my husband filled a glass and it looked more like milk than water.
Overall, it was ok. Just not sure it was worth the amount we paid for the room.......",Positive,,,,,
Need a hair dryer in the bathroom,Neutral,,,,,
"The rooms are dated and have a cold feel about them. When the furnace kicked in, it was difficult to hear anything else. In addition, I attended a conference and was told that I should check for the availability of one bed once I arrived. I was moved to a room with one king bed and then told it was a $10 upgrade per night. After discussing this other conference attendees, I found out that all the rooms are the same or very similar, and they all received the conference rate. Poor practice in my opinion.",Positive,,,,,
I had an office chair with fecal skid marks on it.  The front office was quick to send housekeeping to switch out chairs but there should have been some other compensation or intervention because of the seriousness of the issue.,Negative,,,,,
"The room was fantastic.  The hotel staff was great.  Parking was convenient, and access to the convention center was simple and convenient.",Positive,,,,,
EXCELLENT. BETTER THAN EXPECTED.,Positive,,,,,
Difficult to control room temp and room was too warm. Not enough bartenders on duty to meet needs of crowd on Thurs night given there was a conference there,Negative,,,,,
Room 430. Great room. Couldnâ€™t sleep due to the extremely loud heat system. Loud and very low vibrations hurt ears,Negative,,,,,
"Always a favorite place to stay in Green Bay. Room and 95 % of hotel looked immaculate. Sandwich/ wrap options in the snack bar or ""grab and go"" area could be brought up a notch. Variety and amount of what's between the bread. Pool area was other 5% that needed cleaning up. (same empty beverage glasses that were on the ledge, in 2 different spots, we're there on Saturday night and still there Monday morning..)",Positive,,,,,
Elevators are a disaster,Negative,,,,,
Buffett did not have the variety it did in the past.,Positive,,,,,
"Emma was very cordial, pleasant, and helpful.",Positive,,,,,
"It was a cold day, but I could not get my room to heat up, and the lobby during breakfast with client was also a bit cool for my taste.",Positive,,,,,
"I've been staying at the Green Bay Hyatt Regency now, at least once a year, since 2010 (back when it was the Hotel Sierra). While I'm not particularly fond of the added parking lot gates, I wouldn't really mind them if they happened to work. This is the 4th or 5th year now where I have stayed at the hotel since the gates have been added, and every single year, the same thing happens. When leaving the hotel (I come and go often during my stay), the gate never accepts my validated ticket, so I have to then press the silver help button in order to have a staff member lift the gate for me. It has become such a joke now that on my most recent visit (this past weekend) I didn't even bother to validate my ticket each time I walked past the front desk. I would leave and simply press the help button to have the gate lifted. During checkout yesterday morning, we saw several people on their way out hung up at the gate, who we then helped out by advising them to just press the silver call button. When I checked in on Friday, I even joked with the front desk staff how those gates have never worked. They pretended to not have any idea what I was talking about and assured me that they were now working. An hour later, upon my way out, sure enough, no go! I love your hotel. I've given it positive reviews on TripAdvisor each year I've stayed at your location (even though I am still bummed you took away from the free breakfast I enjoyed my first year when it was Hotel Sierra -- and sort of miffed that I now have to pay $7 a night to park). When I drove past your hotel this past summer (I was only in town for the day), I noticed the gates were permanently up. I couldn't help but laugh to myself and think ""still can't get those f****** gates figured out."" I'm not really upset about the gates... I just find it to be more humerus than anything. I plan to be back at this time next year and possibly for a short visit this summer. Fix the gates. Please. I'm begging you! And while I'm at it, I would be pleasantly surprised upon a future stay if your elevators were to be a bit faster. In the words of Tim Taylor from the show ""Home Improvement,"" those elevators could use some MORREEEE POWERRRRRRRR. Thank you.",Positive,,,,,
"We had to wait on several occasions as there was only 1 person at the front desk to get our parking ticket validated as they were on the phone.  It's a pain getting that validated every time, just my opinion.  We came and went multiple times daily",Negative,,,,,
Great staff & management. Rooms are starting to show some wear.,Positive,,,,,
the heating/cooling unit in room 809 was very loud and difficult to control temp,Negative,,,,,
Wireless signal was very weak.,Negative,,,,,
"All the staff from reception through to catering/kitchen staff were amazing. This was not our first stay at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay and it wonâ€™t be our last. Super friendly, caring and efficient service. Five stars Green Bay.",Positive,,,,,
Everything was fine.,Positive,,,,,
"The Hyatt in GB is my favorite hotel! We were pretty loud celebrating on NYE and the security had to tell us a couple times to quiet down, but they were understanding and very nice.",Positive,,,,,
Front desk person Noely (sp?) was very pleasant and accommodating.,Positive,,,,,
"The guests in the room next to us were very loud, banging on the walls, the large group of people were shouting obscenities, playing awful/obscene music very, very loud until nearly 11pm.  I understand that you cannot prevent people like this staying in your hotel, however the ability of your staff to handle issues like this IS a reflection of the Hyatt brand.  I was staying with my two young children, ages 7 and 5, and the things they heard were inexcusable.  It should not have been too much to ask that guests keep their conversations/music/partying to a reasonable volume so that it doesn't inconvenience people in other rooms. The things my girls heard that night were awful.  When I called the front desk, and the times I went down to the front desk in person the employees I talked to were polite and each time said they would ""look into it"" or do a ""welfare check"" on the people in that room.  Those measures were unsuccessful in correcting the situation.   

On a positive note, there were some fun games set up in the lobby (bag toss, giant checkers, giant Connect 4) that my children and I enjoyed throughout the evening.  The pool was a fun time and a great family experience for us. As an added bonus, an employee gave us toothbrushes and toothpaste when we discovered ours had been forgotten at home.",Positive,,,,,
We always have enjoyed our stays at this location. The front desk attendant who checked us in was warm and welcoming! Our room was clean and comfortable. We love the beds! Nice amenities in room. Clean pool area with seating and plenty of towels. Breakfast was ok. Rate was fair.  We will be back!,Positive,,,,,
"The hotel itself is great, however, the lack of communication with staff before & after our visit is disheartening",Negative,,,,,
"I was told check in was at 3, I was not able to check in til 6 PM, due to wait for a clean room, had dinner reservations that I needed to cancel due to room not being ready.  On one of the busiest hotel days of the year there is no reason to not have any rooms ready in a hotel that is 7 stories high.",Positive,,,,,
"Staffing shortage for Sunday brunch, elevators are horribly, unfathomably slow...with no stairway solutions form lower floors to lobby...fix one or both!",Negative,,,,,
"Rooms and common spaces need serious update.  Very 1990s at best.  Bar/restaurant mediocre at best â€” bartender couldnâ€™t recite the draft beer list, told us to look at the refrigerator for bottle beer choice, and thereâ€™s no beer list!  Draft beer choice really needs a stronger local flavor -   half local craft beer, at a minimum.  Very dull.",Positive,,,,,
The staff was friendly and caring. I wish you could adjust the temperature in the rooms. The location was great with accessibliliy to downtown as well as the east and west sides. I will definitely stay in here again upon my next visit to Green Bay.,Positive,,,,,
"I paid for the hotel and it was debited from my account in addition to two other charges; one for $195 and $196. When I asked about the charge, no one could tell me what they were for and told me to let them fall off. Upon checking out and getting home, I realized another charge for $196 had also been debited and upon calling, no one still knows why these charges are happening. Itâ€™s outrageous that over $550 was debited from the account.",Negative,,,,,
"Nothing to add,  Very professional, clean and pleasant.",Positive,,,,,
front desk staff is excellent,Positive,,,,,
Amazing staff!,Positive,,,,,
"I think we were overcharged for a ""reduced rate"" that we booked under a wedding block of rooms.  There were also others from the wedding block that had breakfast included, but ours was not.",Positive,,,,,
Small thing but definitely think all rooms should have big tvs now first room i had did bit latest one did not.,Positive,,,,,
"The manager welcomed me, however did not ask any questions pertaining to my stay.",Positive,,,,,
"You have an excellent employee in Paul Zagorski, Jr. , the Front Office Manager. He has been very helpful with reservations.",Positive,,,,,
"I reached out the the front desk regarding the odor of marijuana filling my room. Security was quick to respond and agreed that the odor was overwhelming.  Having already unpacked and settling into my room, I was told I would be moving to the opposite corner of the floor and I should pack my things.  

At midnight I was woken to people in the room next to me being very loud.  Why are rooms being booked back to back with no one in the hotel?  Why not spread people out and leave a vacant room in between rooms?  I chose not to address the noise as I didn't want to move again.  
Being as inconvenienced as I was, even though I only reported the stench of marijuana and not the noisy neighbors, I was shocked that I was not offered any compensation for my stay.   A guest was smoking weed in the room next door to me yet I was the one that was inconvenienced.
I will definitely consider other options when staying downtown.  Thank you.  Daniel Yonke",Negative,,,,,
It was difficult to find the front entrance,Negative,,,,,
"I paid to stay in a king suite, was treated very rude my entire stay, then parking and breakfast isnâ€™t included? Super inconvenient for the prices Iâ€™ve paid. Asked if the hot tub and sauna was open and was told yes, yet itâ€™s not. And the way they presented it when I asked was rude. Just not happy.",Positive,,,,,
Install towel bars in bathroom,Neutral,,,,,
Scott in the bar was fantastic,Positive,,,,,
No hot water the entire stay,Negative,,,,,
Room is clean and nice,Positive,,,,,
None,Neutral,,,,,
"This is the 2nd time I had this issue with your temperature control in the rooms. Im not sure if I will return to your hotel, I mean for the price of the room I feel the issue should of been taken care of when I called the front desk but no one ever showed up. Don't think I want this to happen again for a 3rd time.",Neutral,,,,,
"y only complaint, and please don't laugh, standard (low) height toilets. Someday, when you change them out, higher ones are preferred by most I believe. That's it!",Positive,,,,,
I have stayed at This hotel several times when Iâ€™ve been in Green Bay. You definitely are my favorite hotel in Green Bay!,Positive,,,,,
"Don't care for the parking charge given the size of the metro area.
Toilets are very small and seats are cheap
Breakfast sandwich was english muffin, egg and cheese.  All that I spoke with were puzzled why no bacon would be included.
Carpet was thin and needed to be stretched.
No hoppy beers available at the bar.
Really good stay, but the details matter",Positive,,,,,
Everything was great! I would stay here again.,Positive,,,,,
Never heard of having to pay to park in a hotel lot!,Negative,,,,,
the only thing I could suggest would be better lighting for people who enjoy reading.,Positive,,,,,
Great location.  Great price.,Positive,,,,,
This property is not quite up to par with other Hyatt Regency properties. Very old and finishes are just ok.,Positive,,,,,
"The overall open atrium concept is not ideal for visitors with children. You should consider improving the railings and making them higher and safer.  Children would go to the 8th floor and mess around near the lookout and endanger there safety.  Itâ€™s surprising that safety regulations allow this design.
There was a lack of employee presence in particular, of management or hotel security to supervise guest behavior and interaction.  The elevators were extremely slow and difficult to use.",Negative,,,,,
Enough said.,Negative,,,,,
Team bag breakfast (hockey tourney) could have been better.  Egg sandwich for people who don't eat eggs is not good so I skipped breakfast last 2 days.  Could have had other options or sent a selection form (like this survey) in advance to ask people what they'd like for breakfast (maybe choose among 3 options) so you wouldn't have to make extra food that goes to waste.  This would be a huge positive to your guests in my opinion.,Positive,,,,,
Was great,Positive,,,,,
"The staff were beyond wonderful, even when busy.",Positive,,,,,
"Sunday morning breakfast was way way way too slow. Took an hour for our food to arrive. We were almost late to our game and we even said we were in a hurry. 
The hot water situation needs immediate attention. Cold showers are not nice!!!!!!!!!",Positive,,,,,
Zero complaints were were very happy with out stay,Negative,,,,,
Water cold in shower,Negative,,,,,
"I was extremely happy and impressed with how clean the hotel was. It's beautiful and well kept. I have to say it exceeded my expectations, and I think that means even more considering we are dealing with Covid 19. The hotel staff should be recognized for the excellent service.",Positive,,,,,
Everything ok except heat,Neutral,,,,,
"I have always loved this hotel but this stay was less than ideal.  Between the dirty room/couch, soaking my socks on the carpet due to the door that would not close and the hot tub not being open (nor being told that either at reservation or check in) this stay was very disappointing.  As we visit GreenBay frequently, we will probably look for other options next time.",Negative,,,,,
"While the atrium and inside look of the hotel is beautiful, I did feel as though I was Nickle and Dimed on  Parking, Early check-in, Etc. One would assume due to the Global Pandemic that your hotel is not operating at 100% occupancy and even accounting for rooms to stay vacant before being cleaned and rerented that you had a room available for early check-in without assessing a fee. 
Having spent several years running and managing Hotels in both Milwaukee and Wisconsin Dells I had higher expectations going into this stay. My reservation was initially screwed up, I called to correct this only to be told that the day had come and gone and I paid for a room on a night I never stayed. Instead of reinstating my reservation and switching the nights and offering me a complimentary night, I was booked a second room and charged full price. This is not a good business practice. Nor how I would have done things. I feel my initial complaint of this was never escalated, nor brought to the attention of anyone who could do something about this. The rooms were fine. good sitting options other than the bedroom. The bathroom was a little small for my liking, and the toilets were low to the ground and very slow when flushing. You may want to invest in new toilets. 
The bed was wonderfully comfortable as well as the pillows. the Cuibi clock and charging stations were a present surprise and a good upgrade. The tiny balcony was a great surprise and good addition I would have used it were I not staying the night of the Flood inducing rainstorm. I did like that you provided the extra big garbage bag in the room.",Positive,,,,,
Everyone working very hard to maintain business in difficult times.  A very positive experience.,Positive,,,,,
We typically stay a few times a year as we travel to our cabin in Michigan and we've loved the convenience of it being 1/2 way since the staff is always friendly.,Positive,,,,,
Very nice hotel except for leak in room.,Negative,,,,,
"My stay was enjoyable.  Due to COVID, the restaurant was only open limited hours on the weekend evenings. The restaurant food was very good. There was a good variety of daily  breakfast options, and the quality of the food was excellent.",Positive,,,,,
Couldn't control heat to warm in room,Positive,,,,,
"Would like to see a larger array of food options, but understand why it is limited at this time",Positive,,,,,
Not worth the price,Positive,,,,,

Didnâ€™t know there was a charge for parking!,Neutral,,,,,
"Breakfast was okay - the waitress accommodated for our desire to be isolated from other. the room was fine, no fitted sheet on the bed and the door to the balcony did not lock properly. I was disappointed to have to sleep on a bare mattress for 2 nights even after I notified the hotel staff.",Positive,,,,,
Great rate!,Positive,,,,,
Not thrilled that we had to pay for parking. Less thrilled to hear other guests were being comped for it at check-out.,Positive,,,,,
Very enjoyable,Positive,,,,,
The grab and go sandwiches were very dry and did not provide enough sauce to help compensate.,Positive,,,,,
Best hotel we've stayed in.,Positive,,,,,
Very good.  My only small complaint was the toilet stool was so short .  It seemed like it was child size.,Positive,,,,,

TV didnâ€™t work. Problem taken care in minutes. Appreciated the response,Positive,,,,,
I was charged more than the stated price. Received a printed receipt and what was charged to my debit card was $25 more... Not happy about this.,Positive,,,,,
"I stayed in room 635 and forgot to tell the staff when I checked out that there was water on the bathroom floor when I got up on Monday morning.  I was able to spread old towels on it so I could shower and go down for breakfast.  The water wasn't from the toilet or bathtub, so not sure where it came from.",Positive,,,,,
The beds/pillows were the best ever!  Loved them!!,Positive,,,,,
"We drove 7.5hrs to Green Bay for a surgery my husband needed by a specific surgeon. This was our first stay at a Hyatt hotel. We were very pleased all around. The staff was wonderful and accommodating. Our king suite was very clean, comfortable, and perfect for a several day post-surgical stay. Coming from an area with minimal concern during a pandemic and going to a â€œRed-zone,â€ Hyatt took all Covid precautions seriously and made us feel comfortable. We would definitely stay again. Thank you to all who helped us during our stay - Paul, Gennadiy, Kaira(?), housekeeping, and two others at the front desk that I donâ€™t have names for. You did your jobs well. We appreciate you!",Positive,,,,,
Pictures in the website looked good .,Negative,,,,,
"Room had a smell of baby powder, I realize that is fresh, but not the scent I want to smell when I walk in or wake up.",Positive,,,,,
We were checked out of our room before even leaving the hotel. We went down to get breakfast and went back up to make sure we didnâ€™t leave anything before hitting the road and it had already been cleaned.,Positive,,,,,
The elevators are extremely slow.,Negative,,,,,
The bed in #824 needs to be  changed or flipped. The head of bed is extremely sunken. This made it very uncomfortable  for me to sleep. A bad bed can ruin  a returning visit to your hotel (Hyatt Regency Greenbay Wi.),Negative,,,,,
"Our stay was great.  A few suggestions....we ran out of coffee, cups, towels, etc. and had to ask for them regularly.  The staff was good at bringing them to us.  A suggestion would be to put enough in the room for the amount of nights someone is staying.  So we had two people for 4 nights...maybe putting enough coffee/creamer, etc would of been helpful.  Not a big deal and I know with COVID, things are a bit strange when to cleaning rooms regularly.",Positive,,,,,
"It would have been great to know in addition to the Marketplace that there was a Starbucks tucked back in the corner.  Also, I know breakfast can be tough given social distancing, but I didn't eat breakfast either morning because the line was 10 deep and people were waiting a VERY long time.  Not sure if there is a better way to do this...perhaps offer room service if breakfast is ordered the night before?  Either way, i didn't have breakfast either morning.",Positive,,,,,
"The air conditioning was extremely weak. However, the fabulous front desk man sent up a fan very quickly.",Neutral,,,,,
GREAT innovative thinking an implementation of serving customers with a mask exemption!  My room was very comfortable and I appreciated having my parking fee waived!  GREAT customer service!,Positive,,,,,
Parking Fee is too high.,Negative,,,,,

Very satisfied with all,Positive,,,,,
Starbucks needs help terrible service and drinks,Negative,,,,,
"I know that you are following Tony Evers ruling on the masks. But we do not feel that it should be mandatory for every guest anymore that stays at your hotel. We believe it is extremely unhealthy for people, and if you do research on it you will find thst thr masks most are wearing will be keep anyone from getting the virus and is actually causing most all to have many other health issues. Us as a couple we have health issues that make it impossible for us to be healthy wearing the masks, but because we were so tired after driving all day and night, we faced a mandatory mask situation with you. It was frustrating and hard on our health, but we needed a room and rest so we obeyed. Just not right. Just sayin....",Negative,,,,,
Clean.  Very friendly staff,Positive,,,,,
Restaurant not being open is a major inconvenience,Negative,,,,,

It was extremely pleasant I have no complaints!,Neutral,,,,,
"When we were at breakfast in the atrium, there was a leak. We were seated and it began to rain. The rain water started dripping on us at the table. I told the waitress and she said oh that's nothing, there is a bigger one over there...we had to get buckets. Clearly this has been an issue for some time and needs to be remedied. For a hotel chain like the Hyatt to have leaks in the atrium that are falling on patrons as they eat their meal is entirely ridiculous!",Positive,,,,,
"Very satisfied will return. Please note the desk lamp in Rm 630 is missing a shade, hard to have the light on with a bare bulb.",Positive,,,,,
We enjoy the pool for my family nd being close to downtown too.We really enjoy all our stays too,Positive,,,,,

Awesome,Positive,,,,,
Next mini vaca will be here,Neutral,,,,,
Horrible,Negative,,,,,
Great Covid-19 care,Positive,,,,,
You need a bigger parking lot.  Iâ€™ve never been to a hotel where I couldnâ€™t find a spot two nights in a row.,Neutral,,,,,
"Hotels should not offer room rates with breakfast when this leads to more people wanting breakfast than the (reduced) capacity of the restaurant. The line should not stretch the whole way across the lobby. It's bad customer service and at this time, unsafe when people in line don't respect social distance and won't wear masks.",Positive,,,,,
"We were in room 715. There were guests in room 714 that were partying literally all night long. I called the front desk around 3 AM at which time they informed me that they had already addressed the guests. At 5AM when I had enough, I got dressed and found the security guard that I escorted up to the room to point out the extraordinary noise. The security guard informed me that it is time now when guests could make noise. Not what I wanted to hear after being up all night. Upon daylight, it was noted no less that 20 Alcohol beverage cans were thrown out their sliding door and onto the roof. Upon discussing this with the front desk later in the morning, there was no offer of compensation for the awful night. We spent several nights and this was the only occurance.",Positive,,,,,
Room floor carpet was damp during stay in bedroom near patio door.,Neutral,,,,,
Very clean and very nice pool but kind of cold in the pool,Positive,,,,,

I appreciated the friendliness of staff. The entire personnel was very professional.,Positive,,,,,
"It would be nice if the bar/restaurant served breakfast, lunch, and dinner instead of just bar food.",Positive,,,,,
Only item was being charged for early check-in when we requested through our World of Hyatt account during booking off points. There was no mention of fee when the request was made.,Negative,,,,,
Good,Positive,,,,,
Beautiful place but there's no place like home for a decent night's sleep.,Positive,,,,,
Our favorite hotel to get away to. Great mattresses and room darkening curtains for a wonderful night's sleep.,Positive,,,,,
Absolutely love coming there. Prices are great and its a BEAUTIFUL place. Highly recommend.,Positive,,,,,
Was told at checkin breakfast was included and went to have breakfast and was told it is NOT included! NOT happy!,Positive,,,,,
The toilet was a bit slow.,Negative,,,,,
Please see last comments - awesome staff!,Positive,,,,,
"The room (723) could use a deep clean...such as the sliding window track near the floor. Also the bathrooms are amazingly small....thatâ€™ll require some $$, but get rid of the bar area and make a bigger bathroom. Just an idea. Otherwise fine stay.",Positive,,,,,
Unfortunately there was a lot of noise generated by the family next door in the middle of the night. Sound proofing could be improved. Room 303,Negative,,,,,
HVAC system in room very noisy,Negative,,,,,
The staff was excellent!!,Positive,,,,,
Only issue was not knowing about having to pay for parking but they validated every day which was nice since my cards never worked at the gate.,Positive,,,,,
When I checked in I was told that we would receive the breakfast package complimentary because I was celebrating my birthday. The woman was very nice. But when I received my bill we were charged for breakfast. It was disappointing.,Positive,,,,,
Awesome,Positive,,,,,
great world of Hyatt perks.  Nice suite layout & big rooms.,Positive,,,,,
"very clean, expect there was hair on the ceiling in the bathroom.",Positive,,,,,
"Our son's wedding was in a nearby town. We are regulars at your hotel,unfortunately our group size was impacted by Covid19. Your staff was extra considerate with less rooms being used,with this being beyond our control. We will be back with our large group. Say hi to Chester, I saw him in the elevator, he knows our group from previous stays!!!",Positive,,,,,
"My first room card did not work causing me to have to go back down from the 4th floor, with my luggage, to get a new room card.  Someone else mentioned to me that they had room card issues also.  I wish they had a better system to prevent these issues.  On a happier note, I want to mention that I was very happy to hear that Chester is still working there.  He has been a long time favorite of our group that has been coming there for years.",Positive,,,,,
Loved our stay.  We will be back!!,Positive,,,,,
I was charged for the breakfasts that were included in my room. The clerk said that I was only covered for two tho my reservation clearly states two adults two kids. He took care of it. Also why stop room service and have all these people standing around waiting in line watching the servers flailing. That's when sanitization procedures get overlooked. Also.... Onions in my pancakes?,Negative,,,,,
"Staff is awesome .. Paul, Rai , Genny ( my Ukrainian friend ) Korinia.. all are wonderful.. best friendly service anywhere .. Iâ€™ve stayed here about 20 times now and will be returning again soon . Highly recommend this hotel and staff ..",Positive,,,,,
Check in line was at least 5 people long when I arrived with only one person working check in. The wait to check in was at least 15 minutes which was much longer than it should be.,Neutral,,,,,
It was only a one night stay and we were very comfortable.  The young lady at the front desk recommended a breakfast place that was amazing.  She really went above and beyond.,Positive,,,,,
"TV controls were difficult to use.
Carpet in the first room we were given had wrinkled carpeting that needed stretching
Entry door did not automatically latch on closing",Negative,,,,,
Good. Breakfast area was unorganized and we had to wait a long time.,Positive,,,,,

"You and everyone else is over reacting to the COVID panic that has gripped the country.  It is far less deadly than H1N1, SARS-1, Mumps, Meales, Polio and Small Pox.  Get over it.",Negative,,,,,
The lady who checked me was very friendly and welcoming.  The gentleman in the morning was really nice and helpful,Positive,,,,,
Really nice hotel with great staff (with the exception of the breakfast host) and a really ridiculous breakfast mask policy. Why not mask on until seated - as recommended?,Positive,,,,,
You should mention parking is not free on the hotel website,Positive,,,,,
It was horrible and my credit card was over charge,Negative,,,,,
We will choose this hotel for future stays in the area.  Great value for the room and overall feeling inside the hotel.,Positive,,,,,
Clean room but $10 for parking is horrible. A day! Like who does that. Food is absolutely horrible too.,Positive,,,,,
"Again, found the mask policy excessive. And the food to be poor.",Negative,,,,,
"chocolate milk spoiled 
No room cleaning
No sitting in the lobby after 9
No board game offered",Positive,,,,,
I was never told my charges.  The next day at checkout I had a few of $79 for a hotel fee which is outrageous. Plus you make your guests pay for parking which seems ridiculous.,Negative,,,,,
I defiantly will stay here again. I'd never been to Green Bay and enjoyed myself.,Positive,,,,,
Thermostat couldnâ€™t be changed.,Neutral,,,,,
"Some areas of our room showed its age, such as the island housing the fridge was in need of repair beneath the fridge. I didn't expect that at Hyatt.",Positive,,,,,
Parking is terrible and no one explained how to leave with the room key so I ended up paying $5 the first time I left,Negative,,,,,
Missed the cookies at check in and in the afternoon!,Negative,,,,,
Great hotel!  Clean and warm.,Positive,,,,,
Hotel is heavily dated. 5 days later Iâ€™m back here in Green Bay and spending my night in a Marriott property because of the condition of the Hyatt. Restaurant wasnâ€™t open and signs were posted that said it would be open. Had booked a corner room in my reservation and wasnâ€™t given one.,Negative,,,,,
"This hotel is still in good shape, even though some of the rooms could use a refresh.  I was disappointed to see housekeepers in rooms with masks around their chins while they were cleaning.  This is not appropriate.",Positive,,,,,
My favorite hotel in Green Bay,Positive,,,,,
The hotel is dated but clean,Positive,,,,,
"This was probably the nicest hotel for the price ($79/nt.) we have ever stayed at while traveling in the USA. The room was spacious (2 Queen and sofabed suite, the breakfast was excellent and the amenities very nice (pool and fitness room).",Positive,,,,,
"Parking issues, should have been explained better. How to leave hotel parking lot for example. Explaining possibilities of parking overflow. For example, there were two nights. I could not park on the hotel grounds. I had check with the front desk while experiencing the issue. I would of liked to have been told ahead of time. (for example at initial check-in).",Positive,,,,,
"Love the Hyatt in Green Bay. I made a concerted effort to choose this hotel during Covid because I was impressed with their safety policies, liked the idea of a suite in case finding dining options with take out or outdoor dining was difficult, and felt better overall about the spacious layout of this hotel.  I think that some of the materials in the hotel rooms are starting to show their wear and tear and may need replacing eventually (ie, carpeting was pulling up near the bathroom door and the bathroom shelving was pretty scratched up), but otherwise, very clean and well updated.",Positive,,,,,
The bathroom didnâ€™t have exhaust fan. There were several billing errors. We were bill Separately for breakfast when It should have been in the room rate. The gratuity we left for breakfast was wrong. I left $4 per day but I was only charged $1 for both days. I did go back to the breakfast server and gave her the difference.,Negative,,,,,
Breakfast server by the name of cc or jj was excellent.  She is a valuable asset to your hotel,Positive,,,,,
Love the rooms and the hotel overall.  Only recommendation I can think of is to put screens in the sliding doors - I love sleeping with a window open but cannot without a screen due to bugs.,Positive,,,,,
This might have been the better section to note my issues with overcharging for parking that I didn't have access to...,Positive,,,,,
Complimentary breakfast.,Positive,,,,,
I booked a king bed and we got 2 queens. I didnâ€™t have time to address it as we had to catch a bus to a wedding reception. I didnâ€™t realize it until we got to the room.  I am a Hyatt rewards member and not sure this stay was added to my account.,Positive,,,,,
"Please pay more attention to detail when cleaning rooms. The last 2-stays, both on 8th floor were lacking to the point where I almost left to a different hotel.",Positive,,,,,
Keep up with the good work,Positive,,,,,
The breakfast was dreadful & the prices associated with it were outrageous for the quality of the product.,Positive,,,,,
Helpful staff. Even the maintenance guy Luis. He helped me find an outlet to charge my phone,Positive,,,,,
It would be nice if every room came with included breakfast. That's such a nice little perk to have.,Positive,,,,,
"Covid has caused each of us to adjust to the new norm and thatâ€™s ok.  The hot breakfast & coffee (eggs, meat, potatoes, toast and coffee) was not the best.  No butter or jam provided w/other condiments, coffee was weak, despite Starbucks being onsite and in the room.  Refills werenâ€™t offered, so we bought a cup from Starbucks, which was lukewarm.  The hotelâ€™s C-19 attempts are well noted, F/B and room quality need an overhaul.",Positive,,,,,
The staff was very nice. But environment for my child was good. Yes they were all nice. But when my son was in pull there were a group of people swimming and getting drunk and acting foolish. Swimming in there regular clothes. We were told breakfast was free for 2 meals which is what we ordered. I see that they weren't free as its showing on my bank statement.,Positive,,,,,
I was a little disappointed in food options but understand with COVID. It was my birthday and it would have been nice if the bar restaurant was opened. I had difficulties operating the TV and has to get help.  Watching live TV stations should not be difficult.,Negative,,,,,
Thank you for being open during the pandemic. I know that it brought a lot of challenges for the organization and a lot of work went into ensuring safety for the Hyatt staff and customers.,Positive,,,,,
"We had breakfast included as part of our room rate. We didn't want to eat in the breakfast area, so we waited to order. The breakfast area was severely understaffed. There was one woman who was running around like crazy trying to bus and seat guests while also taking the orders of guests who did not want to sit in the restaurant area. She was kind, but she needs some help!",Positive,,,,,
Parking was a disaster,Negative,,,,,
Beautiful room,Positive,,,,,
"I use a CPAP. It is always a struggle to find a plug in for it.  I was grateful that the clock used a passthrough plug so I could plug my CPAP without having to unplug lamps, move the clock, etc in order to sleep through the night.",Positive,,,,,

Would have been nice to know on your website that you have to pay for parking,Positive,,,,,
Would have liked an adult only period in the pool.  Decided not to use because of all the children.  Probably would have used a different hotel that provided this service.  We were looking forward for a relaxing swim and were not able to do this. We did not receive this information when we asked our reservation specialist.,Positive,,,,,

See above message,Neutral,,,,,
"Kaia was absolutely fantastic!!! Cannot emphasize enough how helpful she was throughout the booking process. I changed the details of the trip back and forth several times to the point where I know I had to be a pain. However, she respectfully and kindly kept her patience and assisted me each and every time. Additionally, she answered my many questions in anticipation of our arrival.

The managers Rebecca and Ben were also great. The hotel was awesome but I will eagerly come back to this property because of the service of those three employees alone!",Positive,,,,,
Good location. Staff needs to hype that up near the river and Restraunt  information. Knowledge of the Green Bay area,Positive,,,,,
Maintenance person quickly identified the issue with the air conditioner and we were relocated to another room and floor,Positive,,,,,
Great service. Especially ensuring had hypoallergenic accommodations.,Positive,,,,,
"We were there on a Saturday night and were woken by loud hotel guests shouting, screaming, singing, etc. after 1:00 am. At 3:00 a.m. someone was knocking on our door and told us it was her room. We like this hotel's location, services, room conditions and amenities and will not let this one incident hinder our staying here again.  Thanks for the pool being open.  So nice to be able to get some exercise and movement in a pool these days.",Negative,,,,,

"I loved the firmness of my queen bed. My wife,however, wished her bed would have been softer. Perhaps some double bed rooms could have different firmness levels. Thank you.",Positive,,,,,
"Give Paul a raise cuz heâ€™s the only kind one doing his job right, fix all the outlets in the rooms because they are extreme fire hazards and hire happier staff.",Positive,,,,,
Couldn't figure out how the thermostat worked to make the room cooler. Maybe post direction or something? Also didn't like the light on the bottom shelf of the console between the beds...so bright and no option to shut it off that we could see...we used the Bible to cover it when we slept. Also our card keys sometimes worked and sometimes didn't with the park lot barriers and with the pool room. But overall no deal breakers and customer service was helpful.,Positive,,,,,
"Very nice place! It was nice to be able to walk to restaurants and the river. My only question was needing to have each parking lot ticket validated. I think the front desk attendant and I had different definitions of ""validation"".",Positive,,,,,
Would have been nice to filled on on what wasnâ€™t available at check in or even when I called after reservation was made. My stay was due to medical reasons so as it is was not a very pleasant time.,Positive,,,,,

"Love the new carpet, so bright and cheerful!",Positive,,,,,
"The noise in room 203 at night was obnoxious. Last time we stayed we were on floor 5 and had a fabulous sleep. This time, we didn't sleep at all and neither did all 3 kids. 
Also, it says vending machines on every floor. Floor 2 only has a Pepsi vending machine and when I pressed mountain dew it said sold out. 
Some floors didn't even have vending machines. (My kids were primarily looking for candy/chips)",Negative,,,,,
"Breakfast buffet.  Leave beverages out, including coffee.  Instead of table service.",Positive,,,,,
The hotel was great.  I ate twice at the hotel restaurant and it was excellent.  The conference food however was awful.  I don't know if that is part of the Hyatt or a separate entity....but it was bad.,Positive,,,,,

Staff was great.  Facility not great.,Positive,,,,,
"I have three items I'd like to point out: 
1. No hot sauce at breakfast. That is strange as people love hot sauce on eggs.
2. There should be more than one person behind the star bucks counter at busy times. I got out of line and put my lunch back as it took so long that I was going to be late for my meeting.
3. Ran out of water and coffee at the meeting and had to ask the staff to replace.",Positive,,,,,
"I had many interactions with Paul, the manager, and many others, Frannie, Carson, Kolton, Lora, Rana and they were all extremely helpful and positive!",Positive,,,,,
"Mattresses are too soft (we have stayed in 4 different rooms in this hotel). Toilets are lower than anything weâ€™ve seen in other hotels. Heating/cooling System is not responsive (room did not cool down from 70 to 68, even overnight. No fan control.",Positive,,,,,
The layout of the facility makes it very susceptible to sound issues- I felt it was very loud and I could hear a lot of laughter and interaction even when I was in my room with the TV on.,Positive,,,,,
The buffet breakfast was just OKâ€¦ Compared to Hyatt Place I think it lacked a little bit.  It wasnâ€™t bad it just wasnâ€™t great!,Positive,,,,,

"two Issues, People who seat you for breakfast were sub par. Poor communications, made you feel you were not supposed to be there without a breakfast ticket.  Night Security Guard was on a power trip on Thursday harassing a group of guests who were in the atrium late.  They tried to reason with him but it was handled poorly on his end. He even accused the wrong group staying at the hotel of being a party to the issue. Totaly uncalled for",Negative,,,,,
There were no writing pens or paper pads in the room.  Access to the pool and sauna required walking through the main atrium.,Positive,,,,,
I had a gift card as payment and I wasnâ€™t allowed to use it until check out so I had to check out with the front desk.,Positive,,,,,
I was charged for parking in front of the hotel after I called and confirmed my reservations and was told there was no charge for parking. Not all employees are on the same page when providing information.  Room was big and bed very comfortable. Close to local restaurants and entertainment.,Positive,,,,,

was surprised that the Hyatt did not have an in-room safe for valuables.,Positive,,,,,
Justin was a super helpful and friendly employee. Totally on the ball!  Thanks!,Positive,,,,,
Having to pay for parking in Green Bay was disappointing. I can stay right next door at the Hampton Inn and parking is free as is breakfast.,Positive,,,,,
I feel the added parking fee is unnecessary and the lack of a shuttle before 4pm was also unexpected.,Negative,,,,,
Other then the stain on the couch everything was clean.  Was unable to park in the lot at night that we had paid for so they did credit us our money back and directed us to the parking structure.,Positive,,,,,

"Parking lot that you get charged for , was packed as well . No where to parked .",Positive,,,,,
The only improvements to the room would be towels racks on the walls on both sides of the sink and a full length mirror.,Positive,,,,,
"There seemed to be a shortage of staff for breakfast.  Tables weren't cleaned, entrees were empty, hostess was cleaning tables as he/she seated people.",Positive,,,,,
"Had the breakfast buffet, which seemed a bit overpriced, however, we could not even eat the eggs as they were way too salted.  It was bad.  So our overpriced breakfast we couldn't even eat.",Negative,,,,,

I called the front desk and I had attitude.  They left the blankets from the pullout sofa on the floor.  When I pulled out the bed, there was a huge yellow stain on the mattress and a stained mattress cover.   Again, called the front desk and I got attitude from the front desk and then from the housekeeper that came up.  We have stayed here 4 other times and never had an issue.  We were in town due to my grandfather passing away after a 10 hour car drive.  Our stay could have been much better.",Positive,,,,,
did not like the unadvertised 10.00 per night charge for parking,Positive,,,,,

"Hotel is clean and looks a,among. Always towels in the pool area, very friendly housekeeping staff, but parking wasn't great with all the events going on.",Positive,,,,,
"Nice shower, functional fitness room, good fish entree option at the pub.",Positive,,,,,
Great stay. Lovely hotel and exceptional staff.,Positive,,,,,
"Front desk, breakfast staff and housekeepers were all fantastic.",Positive,,,,,
"Food was not good. I ordered Eggs Benedict and it was an english muffin, a fried egg, and lumpy made from powder Hollandaise Sauce. Where was the ham? I paid $25.00 for that? Besides that the Prime Ribs was too salty, and Pizza for my kids was like cardboard. Nice place to stay, horrible dining.",Positive,,,,,
"Ran out of coffee at breakfast for period of time
Food that was supposed to be warm  
Was not at all.    Ex: bacon and sausage 
Omelettes were under cooked also",Positive,,,,,
What about the continental breakfast being free or way more reasonable for families? :),Positive,,,,,
My family and I have stayed at this hotel several (many) times in the past and will continue to do so in the future.  We are very pleased with everything.,Positive,,,,,
"1) The airport shuttle service was nonexistant. I can understand not running late at night, but not having a driver at 11 am on a weekday is ridiculous. I had to use Lyft to get to and from the hotel.",Negative,,,,,
I tried to check in 2 hours after designated time and was told our rooms were not ready and offered rooms that were not suites when we paid for suites. No compensation was offered with this. Then I was charged 14$ per room because they said they just charge fees to my card on file rather than travelocity because my card was on file. Seems criminal to me. I paid in full when booking and was just given excuses why this happened. Extremely unlikely to ever return given the treatment on many scenarios during my stay. To find a diaper under the couch was absolutely disgusting. And the pull out couch was the most uncomfortable thing I have ever attempted to sleep on. Every bar was extremely pronounced and caused severe back pain.,Negative,,,,,
The young person who greeted us was fantastic!,Positive,,,,,
"I have enjoyed my stay here every year for the WAA Convention since 2007. This year when I was only able to get the WAA convention rate for 1 night, I was relived there was a room available for market rate the 2nd night. Last year when this same booking shortage happened, I was surprised when I checked in that the staff decided to give me the convention rate for both nights. That didn't happen this year. I appreciate the convenience of being on-site for the entire convention.",Positive,,,,,
"Some form of continental breakfast would be convenient and help limit meal expenditures, especially with young children.",Positive,,,,,
"I arranged for gluten free, onion and garlic free food for the weekend and my meals were extremely small, with cold, nasty green beans being the main part of it both nights. Only 3 miniature potatoes one night and a Tablespoon of rice the other night. The meat (chicken breast) was good but very small. I received no dessert. Friday was Valentines Day and Saturday my birthday. Last you I received flourless chocolate cake both nights. I was actually hungry both nights.",Positive,,,,,
Love the layout but simple upgrade would make it look less dated such as replacing interior doors and doorknobs,Positive,,,,,
Green Bay have several inches of snow the night before. We arrived late afternoon the next day and the parking lot hadnâ€™t been plow. Had to use extra caution maneuvering to the lobby.,Negative,,,,,
"I did not want my room entered, apparently that is against your policy, which will cause me to never stay at the Hyatt again",Neutral,,,,,
Only downside was that windows in the corner room were not sealed very well. Very loud people outside in the middle of the night could be heard very clearly.,Positive,,,,,
"Friday evening the hot tub was freezing cold and young screaming children were allowed in there until nearly 11pm. We did have maintenance work on the hot tub but it never warmed up. Had issues Saturday night with the people next to us opening their door and yelling and singing loudly . They also several times attempted to open the door adjoining our rooms. I did bring the issues up to the front desk. We had stayed here several times in the past but after this experience we will chose to stay elsewhere in the future. For the amount of money we spent for this weekend away, it was extremely disappointing.",Negative,,,,,
Very nice hotel and great staff,Positive,,,,,
"Aasked for a roll away bed at check in around 4 o'clock.  Had to ask again at 8,9, and 10 o'clock.  Other than that everything was clean and comfortable. We would stay again.",Positive,,,,,
Overbooked and I had to have a roommate on the second night.,Neutral,,,,,
Bar staff was not up to par,Negative,,,,,
"Spa did not work either of the nights we stayed, which was extremely disappointing since a relaxing getaway was the sole purpose of the stay. Two different stories were told by management, which was especially insulting since one can clearly see on Tripadvisor reviews that there have been issues with the spa since November. My fault for not looking at them before we arrived. No towels were available during either of the adult hours either and had to ask the front desk THREE times to bring them. It's not much fun going to the front desk dripping wet and cold. We have stayed at this hotel MANY times before and after it has been Hyatt. The most recent stay has us questioning our return.",Negative,,,,,
"One of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. Actually wanted to stay another day you have time to truly enjoy it, as our trip was rather in and out.",Positive,,,,,
At 2:30 AM there was a group of men making loud noise in the courtyard.  It woke me up.  I also heard the clinging of dishes as staff was setting up for breakfast.,Positive,,,,,
"The overall hotel is very impressive and for the price of the room we were very happy.  The granite countertop in our room was dirty, I know they can be difficult to clean but ours had some sticky spots.  Also I originally booked the room on they hyatt website with a code for our event.  After doing this I saw that I could get a similar rate, maybe $20 more, but it would include breakfast.  When I called the hotel I spoke with Paul who assured me that when I checked in for our stay I could speak with him and that he would get us a similar deal on breakfast.  When we checked in Paul was there but was too busy to help us.  I explained the situation to the check in clerk who assured me she would speak with him and call my room to let me know what could be done.  I did not receive a call or anything.  We did end up eating breakfast in the lobby and it was considerably more than the deal on Expedia.  I try to always book with the hotel directly, not third party, for better service.  Next time in the same circumstances I will book with the third party.",Positive,,,,,
More food options would be great.,Positive,,,,,
We love this hotel~~ they always treat us fantastic,Positive,,,,,
Everything was very clean and nice. Lots of noise at night kept us up. Was disappointed in the price for the breakfast buffet as we are used to having them included.,Positive,,,,,
Make sure that staff is friendly and helpful not rude. Make sure there is change for purchases. Make sure rooms are serviced each day.,Positive,,,,,
It was cold all night long.,Negative,,,,,
The ironing board in room 211 pad was messed up to the point it left board in prints on my clothes,Negative,,,,,
"We are World of Hyatt members and were not offered yhe late checkout option the people we were staying with were offered. I also think that there should be some sort of free breakfast included. Lastly, we love the hotel, but oftentimes choose somewhere with a better pool area.",Positive,,,,,
"I was surprised to learn that there was a parking fee.  I feel that should be noted when the reservation is made, not at the time of check-in.

Iâ€™m not sure if the Starbucks is a part of the hotel experience but it was way understaffed for the amount of guests that were there for the Cheerleading afternoon session.  There was only 1 girl working it and although she did the best job that she could, the service was obviously slow.  I was in line for about a half hour because one person was not enough to move that many people through the line.   I never usually tip but I gave the girl a tip because I felt so bad for her.",Negative,,,,,
Satisfied,Positive,,,,,
"I have stayed at your Hyatt location many-many times.  When we checked in we requested an upgrade to an executive suite which we then paid for.  After settling in we received a phone call from the front desk saying they wanted to alert us to the fact that on Sunday evening between 9:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m. there would be some work being done outside of our bedroom windows.  It was explained that there would be no noise-perhaps only lights shining. On Sunday evening while in bed there was horrific noise - crashing, etc.  We were unable to even hear the television set at times.  We did contact the front desk and while we were offered complimentary breakfasts the next morning, which we refused, it certainly did not make our sleeping experience at all comfortable.",Negative,,,,,
"the hotel needs some serious upgrades.  carpet is old, bathroom is very old and could use new toilets.",Positive,,,,,
"Breakfast terrible. Bar food sub standard at best, way to high,,$12  for a $4 burger,lettuce,onions,etc terrible and stale,really disappointed in the food period,especially the breakfast.",Negative,,,,,
Speed of elevator needs to improve.,Positive,,,,,
Will definitely stay again. Everyone was very pleasant and friendly,Positive,,,,,
great room for a great price,Positive,,,,,
"Very comfortable room, great property and environment. Reasonable price.",Positive,,,,,
"Id like to give an exceptional thank you to Paul, the manager for working with me on hotel stay!!! He was very understanding",Positive,,,,,
The KI annual sales mtg. Clearly put a strain on the servers for the breakfast buffet.  Beverages were difficult to get in a timely manner.,Positive,,,,,
Food was expensive but expected because of the exceptional quality.,Positive,,,,,
Professional presentable staff. Very friendly. Good location in Green Bay. Room was perfect and private. Continental breakfast is very good and the staff works very hard to accommodate you. We will definitely be back!,Positive,,,,,
"Loved the room and hotel.  Crazy amount of noise until almost 2 AM from the bar area that resonated through the hotel. I had to leave at 4 AM due to an impending snowstorm.  Was shocked at the amount of noise and called the desk.  Also, we reserved a corner room only to find on check in that we were not getting one.  Not sure how that happens with a reservation.",Negative,,,,,
"The bar desperately needs updating. The staffing levels of the bar for the meeting was not adequate for our meeting, which has always been the case, for years. Perhaps additional service stations outside the bar. Cocktails were marginal. Beer was cold though. Food was ok at the bar. Time to get rid of the wrought iron railing. The renovated rooms are very nice. Very clean rooms.",Positive,,,,,
"Great check in 
And breakfast team",Positive,,,,,
"only issue, people in lobby were quite loud very late",Negative,,,,,
Beautiful hotel with large and spacious rooms. I would like to see the coffee bar in the main lobby open earlier than 6:30 a.m. in the future if possible. I worked at Schreiber Foods across the street from the hotel and I had to arrive there by 5:30 a.m. for work. I would have LOVED to get some coffee to go for my day at work!,Positive,,,,,
"This is one of the friendliest staffed hotels Ive ever stayed at, I will always stay here when Im in Green Bay ( and Im a lifetime Hilton Diamond member )",Neutral,,,,,
Bathrooms are a little on the small side,Neutral,,,,,
Desperately needs renovation.,Positive,,,,,
Rooms need renovation. Atriums are find.,Positive,,,,,
"We were at the Hyatt Regency for my daughterâ€™s wedding. Everyone was always concerned about us needing anything. Additionally, we were traveling with my 81 year old fall risk mother with dementia. The staff went out of their way to make my motherâ€™s visit as comfortable as possible.",Negative,,,,,
Awesome,Positive,,,,,
Enjoyed my time,Positive,,,,,
I was there for the BCA pool tournament. Food choices were limited and not very appealing. I had a $5 burger....there were very limited options for condiments. $4 for a bottle of water was ridiculous.,Negative,,,,,
All of the staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  We were especially impressed with Scott in the Pub,Positive,,,,,
Loved the size of the room.,Positive,,,,,
"The silver haired gentleman who checked us in was delightful. He remembered us the next morning when we checked out, which was much appreciated.",Positive,,,,,
I feel your cost to value is a bit off.,Negative,,,,,
The rooms were very noisy.,Negative,,,,,
Everything during my stay was great. The only thing is that it got really cold in the rooms at night.,Neutral,,,,,
Very nice stay.  Stayed 3 nights for state pool tournament.,Positive,,,,,
My room was on the warm side so I did not sleep the best.  I should have turned the heat down. I will know better next time.,Positive,,,,,
Stayed there a couple times now because we enjoy it so much!,Positive,,,,,
The parking validation process needs work. I had to wait at the front desk for that.,Neutral,,,,,
Hot tub was great temp.,Negative,,,,,
"Very Slow elevators
TV remotes weâ€™ll worn and agrivating",Negative,,,,,
loved the room and location not that happy with the parking fee,Positive,,,,,
Do not like paying for parking,Positive,,,,,
"dated bathroom... low toilet, small tub/shower... needs to be modernized.",Negative,,,,,
"Hard surface floor in bathroom very important.  But the bedroom area, I prefer carpet and don't have concerns about cleanliness as long as the carpets are kept well cleaned.",Positive,,,,,
"It was fantastic with the exception of a group of guests who were loud, eating and drinking in the hot tub, and hollering late into the evening.",Neutral,,,,,
Need more vegetarian options in the hot section of the breakfast buffet,Positive,,,,,
In hotel dinning area does not feel very warm or inviting.  Fine for a bar.  Although unlikely to eat in hotel regardless,Positive,,,,,
The elevators were horrifically slow and one of the parking exits never took my parking ticket.  I plan to never stay at this location again.,Negative,,,,,
Need more times for shuttle to and from the airport,Neutral,,,,,
Solid surface floors are better only if they are properly cleaned.,Positive,,,,,
The free breakfast was not very good. Everything appeared to be deep fried and all oil.,Positive,,,,,
"I never received a response from the ""text to receive support"" phone number.

The breakfast setup is confusing. I asked if we needed to sit and eat or could we grab something to go. She seemed confused and asked if were were there for the wedding (we were, but also had stayed that night). She said they were going to serve brunch at the wedding, so we couldn't eat then. It was very weird.",Positive,,,,,
It was a great experience,Positive,,,,,
We love this hotel.....everyone is wonderful. ...we're treated like family !!,Positive,,,,,
The face plate on my iron was somewhat corroded. I left a note for the housekeeper regarding that.,Neutral,,,,,
Deanna the event coordinator for my daughters wedding was wonderful.,Positive,,,,,
"I had to cancel due to the Green Bay Airport being shutdown due to weather. Upon calling just to let you know that I would not be making my stay, the girl on the phone sounded very annoyed that I was bothering her with my call, she was very short, and borderline rude with her attitude. Iâ€™ll just note that I did not ask for a refund or anything else, I was simply being courteous and letting the hotel know I couldnâ€™t make it. You never know if itâ€™s all booked up, maybe a walk in could have been accommodated by me calling. Very disappointed in how she handled the situation.",Negative,,,,,
"I booked the room believing that breakfast was included, based on website info. This was not the case, as breakfast costs extra.",Positive,,,,,
My family would have liked a free breakfast option as they didn't attend my meetings.,Positive,,,,,
Would love to see more gluten friendly options at the restaurant.,Positive,,,,,
Front desk staff was great,Positive,,,,,
Need to update rooms,Neutral,,,,,
"Your staff members are incredibly friendly and efficient all at the same time.  Instead of professional politeness that I encounter so often at other properties, your staff genuinely welcome you and seem to totally enjoy interacting with your guests.  It was our first time to Green Bay but we look forward to coming back!  Thanks so much!",Positive,,,,,
Your elevators are probably due for an upgrade.  They're incredibly slow.,Positive,,,,,
The food in the restaurant as well as the service was not very good,Positive,,,,,
Great stay. Only complaint was no one told me and my guest about the free shuttle to Lambeau Field. Spend about $65 for transportation.,Positive,,,,,
"The prime rib dinner was terrible and tv service was terrible, will no sty at this location again.",Positive,,,,,
was there for two nights and room was not cleaned the first night. had to go down and get towels for second morning.,Neutral,,,,,
"I frequently stay here and never give feedback, but I felt like I should today.  I enjoy staying here, but food and food service need serious upgrade.  Dinner not good for the last year.  Dinner menu leaves much to be desired and food is unsatisfactory and overpriced(should have sent back almost every time).  Went for breakfast at 9:32 and was told they were closed even though people were in line filling their plates from the buffet.  When I pointed this out she said they were here before 9:30.  The buffet trays were full of food!?!?  I will be eating elsewhere until things change.  Everything else at this hotel is great.",Positive,,,,,
"$12 salad I ordered from the restaurant was a cold salad from the fridge in the coffee areaâ€”no complimentary breakfast, wake-up call was 30 min late and I couldnâ€™t get a 30 min late check out being an awards member...",Positive,,,,,
Do a better job ensuring that room is clean and bed linens changed before assigning a guest a room.,Positive,,,,,
"Kaia & Kolton are amazing! My staff and I have been guests for the past 60 days and the entire staff is welcoming and noth short of excellent.  I mention Kaia and Kolton as they have gone the extra mile and build that relationship to make every visit perfect! Keep up the work team Hyatt GB! You guys rock!!!!

"Some staff provided exemplary service others were minimally competent.  Too few parking during an event and no spaces set aside for me as a handicapped guest.  The gates and parking ticketing was a nightmare.  Only once did we not require assistance in 5 days.  Only one set if elevators was working and there was no advance warning that the hotel was under renovation.  Our original confirmed reservation through Expedia was cancelled causing us to have to rebook the room and change all of our plane reservations.  There wad no one to help us with our bags even though I had called to say we would be arriving late and only after requesting assistance was a  security guard found to help us to our room.  She was excellent and even went down to the desk to get new room cards for us when neither of the originals opened the door.  the second night my card did not open the door either but the staff member who was helping me as my husband was busy looking for a parking space got me a new card.  On New Yearâ€™s Ever when we returned to our room, we found someone had entered it although we had posted a fi not disturb sign and left food on the counter with no explanation.  
Then had to stay up another half hour for room service to come fetch it and receive an explanation",Positive,,,,,
When we checked in the presentation of the assistant led us to believe that breakfast was included. In the morning we were told no.,Positive,,,,,
The elevator on the south east end was a bit scary. It was kind of creaky and slow. When we stay in Spring we use those elevators a lot. Maybe I am used to the other side.,Positive,,,,,
We were somewhat surprised that parking was not complimentary.,Positive,,,,,
"Shocked that Hyatt corporate has brought the run down, nasty old Embassy Suites into the portfolio. How can it be a Regency when there are no services, no club? The decor, including the palm trees in the lobby, look ridiculous. Other than a decent Hyatt bed, this has got to be one of the crappiest Hyatt properties in the world,",Negative,,,,,
Noise from them redoing the floors was unpleasant & the floor in the pool area needed a good cleaning.,Positive,,,,,
pool and pool area still cold. It was last year also,Negative,,,,,
"Stayed in Room 802. Something on the roof, over the room, in the wall? was making a noise loud enough to keep me awake. It was enough for me to count the seconds in between. 45 seconds of quiet and 3 seconds of a loud hum?? Just enough from being able to sleep soundly. I loved the hotel stay and would stay there again but would not recommend this room to anyone.",Positive,,,,,
Very nice hotel and Iâ€™ll stay here again next time Iâ€™m in Green Bay.,Positive,,,,,
Was charged a $10 parking fee but had no car in their lot,Negative,,,,,
Stop charging for parking. Room rates are high enough that parking should be included!!,Positive,,,,,
Employees very friendly.   Food good and reasonable prices at the Pub - long wait but very understandable being on Xmas and Iâ€™m sure understaffed so appreciated the Pub workers greatly!   Easy parking at great location to grab the game day bus.  Would definitely stay again,Positive,,,,,
"I live in fear that my next visit to Green Bay will be a bad experience where you will release my room because your express check-in process failed.  It already has happened to me and I've been careful of double-checking my check-in with a call to the desk; however, even after I called the desk my room was still released (it's a system issue that needs to be resolved).",Negative,,,,,
"Also, there were many empty rooms that night. Why were we put in a room adjoining a room with barking dogs?  We didnâ€™t make a fuss because we are pet owners (whose pets were at home) and it was Christmas but it was annoying.",Negative,,,,,
All staff we came in contact with were very friendly and helpful.  The hotel was very clean.  Will definitely stay again if I had the chance.,Positive,,,,,
We received friendly and competent service similar to years past.,Positive,,,,,
"Nice large room but needed updating. Spot in ceiling, carpet was buckling, old/very low toilet, some lights didnâ€™t work. Room 830.",Positive,,,,,
I really liked the fact that it was nice and quiet in the room which made for a peaceful night.,Positive,,,,,
Front guest experience needs improvement. Building and grounds in good shape. Room was as expected. Hyatt rewards experience was subpar.,Positive,,,,,
"Meh, could hardly hear the reception person, a low talker.",Negative,,,,,
"While there were clearly notations all over the hotel stating that guests must wear masks.... no one was wearing them. Your shuttle was not available. When I asked for a taxi service, I was given the phone number rather than you're calling for me. A parking fee per day for a Hyatt member? Travesty.",Positive,,,,,
"The one complaint that we have is paying for parking.  As a guest staying in the hotel and for the price of the room, charging an additional $10 per night for parking seems petty and appears that the hotel is Nickle and Diming its customers.",Negative,,,,,
"Update the rooms , needs painting . Cracks in ceiling and fold out bed was terrible",Negative,,,,,
"COVID protocols were not being followed. 95% of people on elevators, in hallways, and in the lobby were unmasked. Hotel staff never intervened. That made our stay very uncomfortable.",Negative,,,,,
Is it possible to have a fan installed in the bathroom?,Neutral,,,,,
Toni and desk staff were great as was responsive service staff.,Positive,,,,,
Bigger TV in living room would be nice. No bar open on game day. Very poor Breakfast. Awful coffee. High priced rooms you'd expect affordable tasty breakfast. I've had better free continental breakfast at cheaper hotels.,Positive,,,,,
"When checking in, we were surprised to hear that rooms would only be cleaned every fourth day, which was not noted when I booked through the Hyatt website.  In my other travels during covid, alternate days or every third day are common, but i've never heard of fourth day.  We stayed 6 days in the hotel, and despite asking multiple times, the room was never cleaned.  I eventually had to beg at the front desk, and get MUCH pushier than i felt comfortable being, to ask for at minimum some fresh towels and shampoo.  Towels and shampoo were left in a garbage bag outside the door of the hotel room.  
I am disgusted that despite picking the date during check in, asking at the front desk again that morning and confirming two time slots available, and then going to the front desk again the next day after asking the housekeeping staff directly, there was no attempt to clean the room, and the front desk staff seemed to think asking for a cleaning 5 days into a stay was an imposition, and they continuously asked if i wanted a special treatment, when i was very clear that i just wanted a normal cleaning in the middle of my 6-day stay, as i had been promised during check-in.  
I've stayed at Hyatt hotels from Seattle to the UK, including planning corporate events, and have always had an excellent experience.  This was more like what I'd expect from a Motel 6.  I will never stay at this particular hotel again, though i will not hold this experience against the Hyatt chain as a whole.",Positive,,,,,
Nice set up and location. Parking was a hassle because paid and open.,Negative,,,,,
Bed are always comfy.  Alarm clock went off at 6am on a Sat.  :-(,Positive,,,,,
Do not feel the room was worth paying for an upgrade,Negative,,,,,
"Check in process was slow.  There was never more than one person checking people in, however there were sometimes three people behind the lobby desk. They really should have offered to help when we had 4 parties trying to check in.  Also, room keys were not working several times, and people had to go back to the front desk for new keys (several times)",Positive,,,,,
"This was our fourth stay at this location, and we still enjoy coming but the rooms are getting pretty run down.",Positive,,,,,
"The only negative we had with our stay was that the pull out couch was broken. There were several springs missing so the mattress did not lay flat. There was very little support when you would lay on it. We had our kids sleep on it and it didnâ€™t bother them because they are smaller, but I couldnâ€™t sleep on it because the brackets underneath would stab your body in several areas.",Negative,,,,,
I normally buy morning coffee at a convenience store/gas station and pay about $1.  I bought coffee in the kiosk across from the reception area for $3.75 which was ridiculously overpriced for straight black coffee.,Negative,,,,,
"As a World of Hyatt member I have stayed at this hotel 3 other times and aways was able to get a free upgrade. This time we had reserved a standard king room with pull out couch. Upon check in I asked if there was an upgrade available and was told â€œyou are in one of the largest roomsâ€ (ummm noâ€¦it was actually the smallest room we have had there in the four times stayingâ€¦?). When I called down for extra blankets the phone rang and rang. I called multiple times before the phone was answered. Finally she answered and  I was told â€œif we have any they will bring them upâ€. I was like, ok, this is the Hyatt and it isnâ€™t busy. Why couldnâ€™t they take them from another room if necessary? And also upon leaving we were charged $20 for parking. We have never been charged this before and we were not informed of this upon check in. Now, I called Scott after seeing this  charge when we left and he took the charges off our bill (thank you Scott!)",Positive,,,,,
"Great experience, the hotel was quiet and clean, the bar was a fun atmosphere, and the staff was excellent. Iâ€™d definitely stay there again next time Iâ€™m in Green Bay.",Positive,,,,,
Some details in the bathroom could be addressed (mildew in corners),Neutral,,,,,
The bathroom in our room was not in good condition.  Peeling paint and damaged toliet seat.  It's not what I'm used to in Hyatt's and being a Globalist I've stayed at a few.,Positive,,,,,
Good location for Stadium and downtown access.,Positive,,,,,
I wish hotels and motels would offer a special room for those who choose to smoke could do so.,Positive,,,,,
"I was double charged for my room on my corporate credit card, and ive sent multiple messages and called the accounting department multiple times and nobody will contact me to rectify the situation.",Positive,,,,,
"This facility needs a major update, not sure when the last PIP was done but the overall condition of the furnishings and facility were less than good.",Positive,,,,,
There wasn't free breakfast as advertised. We weren't served breakfast even after 1hr and 45-50min of waiting. There was about 50min of wait to be seated and over an hour wait after being seated. We were communicated that there would be 30-40min of wait to be seated but we weren't expecting almost 2hours of wait before being served food - completely ruined our schedule.,Positive,,,,,
Walls are thin. I could hear other people clearly in their room next to ours.,Positive,,,,,
"Everything was nice; the parking was great, the desk person said that they have security monitor it.  There was a note from the GM that the fire dept. had come because someone was smoking in a stairwell.  I did smell cigarette smoke a few times, I think.  But the staff was nice, we'd definitely stay at the HR again.",Neutral,,,,,
I attended a dessert meeting and the cake was stale.,Positive,,,,,
I will say that I wonder who your design population is! The beds were so high they seemed designed for NBA players...while the toilets were so low to the ground as to be designed for midget wrestlers. What gives?,Negative,,,,,

A variety of questions and was very

Rooms need some updating. Pool  hottub and sauna was amazing!!,Positive,,,,,
very low occupancy during the week and a lot of staff. There is no obvious reason for limited service.,Negative,,,,,
The toilet was very low and made it difficult to get up and down.,Negative,,,,,
I found the design with the desk next to the TV helpful. I could work with the TV in the background and got a lot done. The shower was nice and strong.,Positive,,,,,
The food and parking were overpriced. A yogurt parfait I purchased for breakfast had moldy berries in it.,Positive,,,,,
"It is a lovely hotel and the new conference center was great - though A LOT of walking. 

Faster Starbucks would be nice, but I realize everything is short-staffed right now. I never successfully waiting in line for coffee bc it took so long.",Positive,,,,,
"Thank you for selecting a room for us with a bed that we felt was firmer than the previous stay.  Also, we were delighted when we checked in that the first comment made to us was ""we took care to get you a room in response to your comments on the last survey.'  You do pay attention to what your customer said.",Positive,,,,,
"Restaurant staff spread too thin, waited for my check for a long time.  Other staff unwilling to pitch in and help with overflow",Negative,,,,,
"Our breakfast server, whose last name is Wild, was delightful. She really took care of us and made us feel at home.",Positive,,,,,
"Globalist benefits are awful, you get a print out indicating that you are allowed to order one entree and coffeeâ€¦ no fruit or speciality coffee such as a simple cappuccino or late. The hotel is old and does not represent the Hyatt brand as it should",Negative,,,,,
"Booking on the phone was a little disappointing. First Lady was amazing and helpful and talked with me, second lady (forts had technical difficulties) was cut and dry and cold. But did the job I needed her to do",Negative,,,,,
It was a real treat to stay in a hotel again after being in lockdown and not traveling during COVID.,Positive,,,,,
The carpet in our room 416 was a little lumpy,Negative,,,,,
Very nice stay!,Positive,,,,,
"I upgraded my room to a corner room because I wanted the evening to be special. Even though the hotel was not full, a party of 5 including two small kids got the room next to us.  The kids cried a lot and were up really early.  Kind of ruined my expectation of the weekend. Lot of the draw I guess.",Positive,,,,,
I can't believe that there was not an option for a fan or to lower the heat. Our room was so hot and the technician said it was set correctly because heat was on in hotel so if we wanted it cooler we needed to open the slider.  There was no air ventilation.,Positive,,,,,
"The only problem for me was that I am gluten intolerant, and when the cafe was closed due to lack of staffing, I only had the option of boiled eggs (which I appreciated) and GF potato chips.",Negative,,,,,
"There was no desk or desk chair in the room, so to work, I had to sit on a ottoman with my computer on a beside table and it was very uncomfortable.  The room was very dark unless all lights were on, the hallways and lobby were also very dim and the carpet in the room was so loose there were several ripples in the carpet.  hotel needs an upgrade for sure.",Negative,,,,,
Masks are unnecessary,Negative,,,,,
Housekeeping could do a better job in cleaning. Look behind beds. Very dusty and junk behind it,Positive,,,,,
"There were a couple staff members that werenâ€™t very accommodating or failed to understand how to do a 2-card transaction. One waiter at the pub had to clarify what moscato was, even though it was listed on the drink menu.",Positive,,,,,
You need to provide better food service!!  It was great on our last visit but very poor this time!,Positive,,,,,
The staff was very kind and polite,Positive,,,,,
No tissues in the rooms.,Neutral,,,,,
Very courteous staff very accommodating,Positive,,,,,

Get your reservation system communicating with the actual hotel. This disorganization and poor communication cancelled our reservation instead of changing it and we had to cancel the majority of our family plans due to lack of space and a room 1/2 the size that I booked back in June for this November. AND IT WAS A PREPAID ROOM. Never again will i trust my vacation to a Hyatt.,Negative,,,,,
The rooms were very dated .. usually when you pay more than $400/night for a room it is updates,Negative,,,,,
"Excellent service, procedures, check in and check out simple, loved the early check in via email.  Staff in Green Bay were friendly and courteous.",Positive,,,,,
The bar tenders were very rude and un friendly to guest.  A full bar at 12:00 and you start yelling we are closing soon and then do a count down.,Positive,,,,,
"My wife and I were very displeased with the customer service during our breakfast on Friday, November 12. The ladies were not standing at the greeters stand however were instead standing behind  a counter off around a corner and could not be seen. I felt the one was quite rude when I asked a question and as I watched other guest come in for breakfast they did not know what to do as there was nobody to greet them and explain that the menu was on an app. People skills were very inappropriate in my opinion. I did report this upon checkout to the young man on Saturday morning. I did not get into detail however I was able to point out who the lady was that I felt was not customer friendly. I believe the gentleman's name was Jesse that I told??",Positive,,,,,
"The 'food service' (breakfast experience) was hard to gauge as there were few employees available. I think it is just the current state of things, not the hotels fault.",Positive,,,,,
The weekend was a delightful break for us.  Weâ€™ll definitely be back!,Positive,,,,,
"Tobi was very patient in helping me with my World of Hyatt app, I wanted to make sure I got my points and was on the app correctly.",Positive,,,,,
"Lose the mask mandate- don't make my stay ""political"" that's not your job! Your job is to see that I recommend your hotel not bad-mouth it because you have ""shitty"" standards or your employee base isn't that of people from the moon. Who inspects the rooms after they have been so-called cleaned? Who rights off on this shitt?",Positive,,,,,
overall very happy,Positive,,,,,
Bed and pillows great!,Positive,,,,,
"I stayed in the Hyatt for three nights and four days for a conference.  Every contact I had with Hyatt staff was professional, to the point, and I received the information I was seeking.  Simply an excellent, professional, and well-trained staff who were focused on providing me with the information I was seeking and showing concern for my needs.",Positive,,,,,
The hotel needs to be refurbished.,Neutral,,,,,
Iâ€™d appreciate getting the room charge off my credit card.,Positive,,,,,
conference room very cold,Negative,,,,,
I found your pet friendly line to be a bit extreme considering you charged an (not so friendly) extra $100  for cleaning fee in a room that could have been cleaner to begin with,Positive,,,,,
Bed hurt both my husbands and mine backs,Negative,,,,,

"Very nice hotel and you did a great job with the conference.  I know it's hard to attract and retain employees right now - you could have used more at the check-in desk, but I understand staffing may be an issue.",Positive,,,,,
"Very good, everyone was very nice.  It's an excellent facility.",Positive,,,,,
Already said!,Neutral,,,,,
"Coffee setup in room stood out, very simple and appreciated",Positive,,,,,
The Turkish woman was excellent! She was everywhere -- a very hard worker; excellent English speaker and pleasant personality. Definitely has quality that could make her successful in this country.,Positive,,,,,
Conference staff very friendly and helpful.,Positive,,,,,
Very nice but sign on thermostat to contact desk to have heat on or off would be nice,Negative,,,,,
What good are the points if you canâ€™t use them to stay there cause I wanted to stay another week but they said place was booked full and I have over 8700 points unless thatâ€™s not enough,Positive,,,,,
"overall the best were the beds and pillows, too bad we couldn't sleep because it was so blasted hot in the room",Negative,,,,,
Good location and fantastic convention center. I just think that the rooms could be upgraded to meet current customer tastes and needs. Staff was good and helpful.,Positive,,,,,
Bathroom needs a longer and higher toilet seat.  Door opening needs to be turned to out rather than in to a small bathroom,Negative,,,,,
Put exhaust fans in the bathrooms. Attach some kind of towel rack in the bathrooms for your towels.,Positive,,,,,
Getting the World of Hyatt site to download was difficult- only able to do so on my iPhone. So got reservations in that way. Messages on Google say this is a problem for others who use chrome.,Negative,,,,,
"Room dated. For price would expect more updated shower, flooring, window and lighting. The bed was very comfy though.",Positive,,,,,
"The pool / hot tub hours were too limited.  For a business professional, 7am-11pm hours would be better than the 10am-10pm offered.",Positive,,,,,
Is my favorite hotel in Wisconsin for attending conferences.,Positive,,,,,
The hairdryer was in an awkward place.  Most hotels will store it under the bathroom sink or near by.  Mine was in the closet by extra blankets.  I came across it by mistake.,Negative,,,,,
You clearly need more people at the front desk during conferences. There was one young man there fielding phone calls and trying to help people at the desk. He was clearly overwhelmed and the wait time for assistance was unacceptable.,Positive,,,,,
"they did not provide waters in the room, like my other Hyatt stays. There was no-one in the convenience store to cash you out for what you where buying.",Positive,,,,,
Bar doesn't open until 5 in Green Bay?,Neutral,,,,,
"Again my comment about Scott and Summer in the restaurant:

Scott in the bar WAS AWESOME! Him and the server Summer were outstanding. Literally just the two of them and the restaurant was packed! Every table filled. They were running the entire time. They need a raise!!",Positive,,,,,
My room key did not work for the parking and I was charged $18.00 to leave the lot.,Neutral,,,,,
"The nickel and dime costs were very frustrating. Parking charges were not disclosed at check-in. We were just told to swipe our key to get in and out. Charging for parking in a city of 100K people that has ample parking everywhere is a little ridiculous. We asked for a slightly later checkout, on a Packer game Sunday when everyone was checking out on time, and was told no problem, then at the very end as we were walking away, told there's a $15 charge for that. The $100 charge for our pet was completely disclosed, but also severely over-priced, considering everyone knows there isn't any ""deep cleaning"" of the room that is done.",Negative,,,,,
Draino in bath sink is needed and some mildew,Positive,,,,,
"The lobby is very nice. But as soon as you enter the rooms, you get the overall feeling that everything in the room is old. Not really worth the price we paid.",Positive,,,,,
clean the rooms daily,Positive,,,,,
"Make breakfast available with room booking. 
Open pool for bigger time windows.",Positive,,,,,
If a person is going to stay 2 nights and you aren't going to offer housekeeping put more coffee Kcups in the room,Positive,,,,,
"I think the parking situation was very confusing. Also, the $10 charge per night for parking was unexpected but maybe I did not check it carefully before booking.",Negative,,,,,
The layout of the hotel is nice however I checked out a day early because the beds were awful. They were extremely soft and I sunk in the middle. Felt as though they were at least 15 years old. I couldn't take another night of not sleeping. The hotel could definitely use a remodel and I would recommend starting with new beds.,Positive,,,,,
We were thankful to have breakfast available.  It ended up taking more than an hour to be served.  I'm wondering if offering a few standard choices may speed up the process?,Positive,,,,,
Don't enforce Masks. Let free Americans make a choice for themselves.,Positive,,,,,
"Pool hours were not as listed on web site. Pool actually closed entirely at 10pm, not ""10-midnight adults only"" as listed on web site. This was very disappointing as we were thus unable to use the pool.  Lack of any food service in evening also disappointing.",Negative,,,,,
"Beautiful hotel, great location, room layout was amazing!",Positive,,,,,
We were told to park in public ramp across the street but couldnâ€™t get out.,Positive,,,,,
I would highly recommend.,Positive,,,,,
"The room was reserved for 3 individuals for 2 nights.  Only 1 set of toiletries were in the room, only 1 plastic cup, and only 2 coffee cups.  I went to the front desk, and they sent requested items quickly.  The table in living room area was not cleaned well.  We moved the lamp to play a game and it had clearly not been moved in sometime.  It was close to stuck to the table.  The stand mirror in the bathroom was rusted and nasty.",Positive,,,,,
"Clearer explanations about parking would have made my stay better. First it was advertised as $10/night. Then I was offered validation. Upon checkout, there was a $5 charge on my bill for parking. If I'm spending $200 to stay one night, you can maybe not nickel and dime me for a night of parking.",Positive,,,,,
Good. Thank you,Positive,,,,,
The only concern was parking with the two conferences at the KI Center.  It would be nice to share the different locations and/or parking protocol prior to check in at the hotel.,Positive,,,,,
Cassiana was wonderful. Very friendly and efficient.,Positive,,,,,
Loved the motion night light to assist at night,Positive,,,,,
"in the AM, even the security guy helped with bussing...kudos",Positive,,,,,
This hotel is in dire need of a renovation.,Negative,,,,,
"Compared to other Hyatt Regency properties we have stayed in, this one is in need of an update.  Although the room was clean, the furniture was old and scratched, sofa was stained, lamp shades were bent, curtains were frayed and the bathroom had a mildew smell.  Bar/pub open hours were minimal which was very disappointing.

I do want to mention that the front desk clerk, Tobi, was always very helpful and attentive.",Negative,,,,,
Disappointed with no continental breakfast.,Negative,,,,,
"Room was clean for the most part, had a little mold in some areas of the bathroom.  Also it was cold in the room",Positive,,,,,

"Our room smelled like a damp basement. Drywall has a lot of damage. Outdated room for sure. 
Parking was terrible because of wedding visitors. I needed to park across the street the last night. 
Honestly Iâ€™ll never stay here again in the future.",Negative,,,,,
"Check-in and WOH deductions made as I made reservation via Costco and WOH info did not transfer. I had it added at check-in but was somewhat surprised that the room assignment did not change when the guest went from a nonmember to an explorist. I had no complaints about the room I was assigned but an interesting perspective on the value of loyalty.

I also strongly encourage the addition of electric vehicle charging. Had I planned to bring my regular EV, there would have been a strong convenience factor in choosing the Hampton Inn for its chargers and with the perks of brand loyalty shown above, brand is a lower priority factor in future decisions.",Positive,,,,,
"Like I said, the front desk help was stellar.  The person working the marketplace could have been more attentive",Positive,,,,,
Breakfast in the past were excellent. The box breakfast was tasteless and lacked options. Coffee/beverages were not nearby and were empty!,Positive,,,,,

Shows better on internet",Positive,,,,,

We enjoyed our visit!,Positive,,,,,
"Our restroom was not stocked with toilet paper, we had to call front desk  to provide we had one guest in particular with diet restrictions and upon consulting with servers the staff acknowledged they forgot to accommodate her on Fri and Sat night. By the time she recd her meal at at the wedding others were done and eating cake and dessert. I do understand and empathize how challenging it is with a pandemic among us. It would have been nice to have clean linens and towels and our garbage emptied which hS been usual and customary in a hyatt hotel dedicated to service excellence",Positive,,,,,
There was only 1 person at 7 PM for check in....there were about 9 people waiting in line.,Neutral,,,,,
"I love this hotel and look forward to staying here each year, this year was disappointing.",Positive,,,,,
Scott in the pub 333/ bar is an excellent employee,Positive,,,,,
My main dissatisfaction was with breakfasts. The breakfast burrito and egg/sausage sandwich were both fairly dry (a/more sauce in them may have helped); this was exacerbated by the drinks being down by the ballrooms instead of having even water available in the dining room.,Positive,,,,,
"Bathroom was tiny
Toilet did not flush on one flush- toilet was outdated",Negative,,,,,
Paper plates would have been good for the grab and go breakfast,Positive,,,,,
Entering and exiting the parking lot is a complete hassle.,Positive,,,,,
This hotel was not like a traditional Hyatt Regency. That name indicates a higher quality facility and rooms. This one was more like a travel motel. No nice bar or restaurant. Rooms are outdated and not luxurious at all. The courtyard area is dark and uninviting. Everything seemed run down and old. No toast with breakfast entries?! Are you kidding?,Positive,,,,,
FOOTBALL Game visit breakfast was poor because lack of personel I cassume because of covid 19,Negative,,,,,
Inflexibility by staff to accommodate late check out request for 12:30pm instead of 11am.,Negative,,,,,
"There was a 5K or marathon right outside the hotel on Main Street.  They were setting up, playing music, and doing microphone checks at 5am on Saturday.  We got there plenty early on Friday and would have appreciated a room that did not face this noise.",Positive,,,,,

Didn't get recognized as Globalist on check-in; wasn't asked about water--had to ask where to find it",Negative,,,,,
Just surprised no fresh towels each day if we didn't ask.,Positive,,,,,
Having fruit or more children foot options in lobby coffee would be nice.  I had 2 kids upset as only 1 chocolate chip cookie was left and with their age were not into bagels.,Positive,,,,,
Could use higher toilet,Negative,,,,,
There is no daily room service so there is no coffee. They had decaf k cups in the room and no creamer. The hotel wants you to use the Starbucks store to buy coffee.,Negative,,,,,
"Water should be complimentary to guests for the price of the room. Most hotel chains, Marriott, Hilton. Provide free water. Night desk clerk could have been more helpful.",Positive,,,,,
"I thought I had indicated a need for a handicapped-accessible room when I made our reservations months ago. I called twice in September to check on this. I was told by a reservationist that it was taken care of. When I called again, it wasn't. This reservationist assured me that he had taken care of it. I was expecting an accessible room. Apparently, taking care of the situation means putting in the request and not verifying that your room request is honored. I wish that had been made clear. I imagine those room fill up fast and understand why one wasn't available for us. The front desk clerks made sure that we got a shower chair in a timely manner. This allowed my husband to shower before our grandson's wedding. Thanks to the two women behind the desk midday on Saturday!",Positive,,,,,

"I attended the WBA Management Conference and there were a couple of comments at the table about the ""Grey Steaks"" which were disappointing Monday night.  They were tasteless and also quite rare in the middle.  Also the chicken lunch was HORRIBLE the next day.  Dry, hard chicken (so dry it turned up at the edges?!), tasteless rice and just NOT good.  I expected more from a Hyatt...but I also know conventions don't spend much money on banquets, so oh well!",Positive,,,,,

"The hotel was beautiful, my kids loved the glass elevators and staying on the 7th floor, and of course the pool was a big hit! We will be back again :)",Positive,,,,,
"The room space was very accommodating.  However the room location was one of the worst possible and VERY noisy.  We had a room that faced the busy street and hear VERY LOUD traffic noise well into the early morning hours.  My one daughter that can sleep through anything, couldn't sleep.  We were also right across from the elevator.  Hotel did not seem busy to fill rooms that were more optimal.  Also, I had called to get a group rate through UW Green Bay when making the reservation.  Reservations call center gave me a discounted rate of $94.  When I called the hotel directly, I was quoted a  rate of $107.  Others in the group had a rate of $87.  I forwarded my email to the front desk person, Jett Martin, who said would talk with hotel manager.  3 days later I still have not heard anything.  Also was not told by reservations desk that there was a $10 parking fee.  Very disappointing.",Positive,,,,,
"Facility is very nice, except for the deficiencies mentioned above. Housekeeping too infrequent - I had to obtain extra coffee, glasses, cups etc from the maid in the hall. Why no towel bars? If no daily room housekeeping where are we supposed to hang wet towels? This may be the first hotel I've ever visited (former travel agent) where I had to pull a ticket to get in on arrival. And we seniors like grab bars in the bathroom. And bathroom fans.",Positive,,,,,

Very small item but the lid for the coffee cup didnâ€™t fit.,Positive,,,,,
There is only one small hook for a towel to hang in the bathroom.  It would be nice if there was someway to get your hand towel off of the counter.,Positive,,,,,
"When I checked out I had to present my company's credit card authorization again even though I had submitted it online ahead of time. The front desk was going to charge my personal credit card for parking even though the authorization form indicated that would also go on the company card.  I offered the S-211 form when I checked in but was told it wasn't necessary, but when I checked out I was charged tax and had to present the S-211 to get the tax removed.",Positive,,,,,

First WOH award stay. Love the program and love the quality of service and amenities.,Positive,,,,,

I would like to see the option to have custom made omelets back. The scrambled eggs as the only option doesn't quite cut it.,Positive,,,,,
It was fine.  I have been coming here for years and it seems the rooms are getting a little outdated.,Negative,,,,,
"Fantastic! Will be back!

Only thing that sucked were the drunk idiots smoking in their rooms and carrying bottles of booze around like it was a cup. Heard they were rude to security too. Not your fault. They just could learn some respect for others but clearly they have some superiority complex.",Positive,,,,,
While not necessary it would have been nice to have the room touched up during the 2 night stay. (Towels and coffee refills),Positive,,,,,
It was terrible. I stayed there last year and it was much better than my most recent stay. Won't recommend and will not return.,Positive,,,,,

We were visiting from FL and realize how important those precautions are.   We enjoyed our stay very much.,Positive,,,,,
"Bartender made ""last call"" on Tue night before 10pm which was odd. There were people in the bar and several people wanted to come in but the bartender had locked the doors and wouldn't let anyone come in. By the time a decison was made to re-open, most people in the bar had left and others who wanted to come in had already left to go elsewhere. Not sure why this happened, but didn't seem like a good move when conference attendees wanted to come in and enjoy a beverage.",Positive,,,,,

"We are content and happy Hyatt members and need to bring this to management attention. 

My wife has polio and uses a wheelchair. She works with the United Nation on implementing international disability policy.

We have never complained nor have we ever been disappointed staying with Hyattâ€™s. We alway leave a $5 to $10 tip cash under our pillow for house keeping. 

We have to share that the Green Bay Hyatt Regency Convention Center Hotel, especially the ADA room #701 has changed this excellent track record.

July 22, 2021, My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay in a ADA room # 701. A few problems that should be addressed.

The King Bed needs to be replaced ASAP as the left side sinks in the middle. I believe that for many years of people sitting and sleeping on the left side the springs/coils have giving out. FYI, We have a king Hyatt mattress at home.

The microwave is broken, will not heat water. When attempting to use, it smokes, the wires are burning inside and smells like a fire is going to start. I did not unplug as management of house cleaning needs to confirm.

The ADA shower drain needs to be rotor rooter out. The tile shower floor tilts to one side, 1 to 2 gallons of water collects in a puddle and will not drain. The only way to clean up is to use two large towels. This is extreme dangerous for wheelchair users or for anyone with a disabilities. 

The L shape brown couch with a matching otterman. This couch needs to be quarantined or brought to a landfill. There are multiple stains all over this couch. I would guess that it is 20 plus years old. I would request that Hyatt management use a black light to confirm my observation.

We drove all day from MPLS to Green Bay. We check in a little before 4 pm, got to our room about 4pm and construction workers were jack hammering on the side of the building. We were 7 floors above the jack hammering. This was vibrating our room.  I went down and ask the front desk when he thought they would finish he said hopefully 5pm. At 5pm the construction work stopped. 

Oh yea, at or around 4:45pm the fire alarm goes off, I rolled my wifeâ€™s wheelchair to the elevator. Where a line of people were waiting with the alarm still ringing. We later learn from a letter from management that  the alarm went off due to construction dust. 

The past 20 years, my wife and I have been staying at many International Hyatt Hotels around the world. We have stayed at the Hyatt in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Hanoi, the Park Hyatt in Saigon, Vietnam, the Jakarta, Indonesia Hyatt, our favorite is the Yogyakarta Hyatt in Indonesia. MÃ©xico City Hyatt, NYC, etcâ€¦. etcâ€¦. etcâ€¦.

Thank you for your attention in this important matter.

The breakfast was average.,Positive,,,,,
CLEAN THE TAP LINES IN YOUR BAR,Positive,,,,,
Hotel room and lobby are tired. They need to be upgraded.,Positive,,,,,
"The only reason we chose this property was because it claimed to have a shuttle to the airport.  When we checked in we were told this was not true.  Even before COVID precautions, the shuttle was mainly for Delta aircrew.  That should be clearly stated in the description.  The cost of Ubers to places the shuttle should have covered was costly.",Positive,,,,,
There were not enough people working at the front desk.  There was no reason I had to wait almost ten minutes to be served.,Positive,,,,,
I have already stated my feedback.,Neutral,,,,,
Ice machines were hidden and hard to find,Negative,,,,,
Nicest place I have been. It was beautiful.,Positive,,,,,
When checking in was unable to add additional day stay had to use Expedia app. Was told it was to hard of a process to add another day.,Neutral,,,,,
Breakfast was a disappointment for the price. Coffee was basically colored water. Unfortunately this precluded us from not dining at the hotel for the remainder of our stay.,Negative,,,,,
Staff was great. Needing to request each day to have the room cleaned is ridiculous.,Positive,,,,,
The staff was very friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay there again next time we are in the area!,Positive,,,,,
High marks for Madison but all of the staff were great and courteous.,Positive,,,,,
We come here often. It is our favorite hotel in the Green Bay area. I come here for conferences at work and have returned for special date nights with my wife. I was admittedly disappointed at check-in. I specifically asked for a top floor room looking west towards the river area when I booked the room via hyatt.com when we checked in the clerk seemed not to even know we had made that request and then told us no rooms were available. I had reserved a King corner and even said a non-corner room would be fine even not looking out towards the river just on the top floor. She politely told us none were available. I only saw one person exit a room on the 8th floor during our stay. It didn't appear that anyone else was staying on the top floor. Could be I am wrong but it seemed a room may have been available and just wasn't offered. The front desk clerk was very nice and polite (as always) it just left a bad feeling about it in our normally wonderful past visits to the Hyatt GB.,Positive,,,,,
"Wasnâ€™t expecting to pay for parking. Also, would have been nice to have room leaned at least once during my stay.",Positive,,,,,
Thermostat totally not working,Positive,,,,,
"Parking lot filled nightly, the overflow option was not apparent.",Positive,,,,,
"Old not give fair review of food, did not eat there.",Positive,,,,,
Would be nice if you opened the bar on Sunday and Monday.,Positive,,,,,
"The front desk was slow at checking me in. Nice clean room but too warm. Parking was awful. Pool was very nice. After eating one breakfast, I decided to go out from then on.",Positive,,,,,
We were a bit disappointed. Our room this time was ok however the bed linens were stained & couldn't be used. Also the bar wasn't open & we hold our Sunday meetings there.,Negative,,,,,
"All other hotels I have stayed at start breakfast before 7am.  We had business to attend to and had to leave at 7.  When I asked about ordering a take out, they indicated I could do it at 7. Nobody was there at 7 to do it.",Positive,,,,,
We were here for a funeral,Negative,,,,,
Bathrooms need more towel bars for hanging towels. Condition of bathrooms is far below equivalent hotels. Otherwise the rooms worked out well. Also consider how to better communicate up front and online about COVID restrictions like the pool hours and frequency of housekeeping.,Positive,,,,,
"Our morning experiences in your Starbucks was horrible.  There was one girl who could not multi task and was exceptionally slow in servicing orders.  She was alone. I waited in line for 20 mins with only 1 other customer ahead of me.  For 2 bagels, regular coffee and hot tea my total time spent was over 20 mins. L. Unfortunately the experience, and the same girl, was exactly the same on Sunday.",Negative,,,,,
Trying to call hotel call center and get info off of website rather difficult.,Negative,,,,,
Well when I checked in the person behind the counter looked at me like I had three heads when I checked in. I guess because I wasn't wearing three piece suit. It was like pulling teeth to get instructions on where to park. After that I figured I was on my own and did what I need to do to enjoy my stay. The staff pretty much did not ever acknowledge you were there. Not what I expected from a higher end hotel,Positive,,,,,
To be more user friendly for Srs. you need higher toilets and a grab bar in the shower/tub area. bed and pillows were very comfortable.,Positive,,,,,
"When we arrived late from our delayed flight, the restaurant and bar were closed and the staff couldn't point us in a direction to get food. And the next night, the bartending staff were ill equipped to serve anything other than a simple vodka tonic. Other than that, our stay was very nice.",Negative,,,,,
"We will be telling everyone to avoid this hotel. There are so many other ones in Green Bay. For the price, even a staffer saying ""that sucks, I'm sorry, we will look into it for next time"" would have gone a long way.",Negative,,,,,
Terrible traffic noise,Negative,,,,,
Good experience,Positive,,,,,
Very comfortable. Will stay again.,Positive,,,,,
Room had all amenities and very clean. Plug ins for iPhones and beds were clean and comfortable,Positive,,,,,
Thumbs up,Neutral,,,,,
"Bad. Total lack of mgmt, employees not seemingly having a clue of what or how to do anything, gross lack of training, no review or watch over pool area, the list goes on!!!",Negative,,,,,
"The hotel is dated. Rooms were updated, but interior doors and door fixtures were original. This used to be THE place to stay in Green Bay. Now itâ€™s A place to stay.",Positive,,,,,
Cassianna treated us great! She went out of way to make our stay very enjoyable.,Positive,,,,,
"I havenâ€™t stayed in a while because last time I wasnâ€™t aware of the parking fee, the breakfast was supposed to be included, and the WiFi fee, so I tried again. This time the only fee I have on my credit card is the room and $5. Was told it would only be the room, so not sure what the $5 was",Positive,,,,,
"Rooms need a refresh,  bathroom had cracked plaster.

Bed was comfy.",Positive,,,,,
Long queues for breakfast and slow service for refilling tea/coffee making needs in room,Positive,,,,,
The toilets could be a little higher,Neutral,,,,,
Everything was great except for the water issue,Negative,,,,,
Great staff!,Positive,,,,,
Air-conditioning was locked and couldn't be adjusted.,Positive,,,,,
"Property is nice, but there are plenty of nice hotels in Green Bay.  They should all compete on service.  Manager apologized, with apology accepted, but the issues with check-in/checkout ruined the trip.",Positive,,,,,
The hotel needs urgent renovation,Positive,,,,,
"Fantastic suites, pool, breakfast and dinner!!  Great quality and I would definitely stay again.",Positive,,,,,

Tonâ€™s of you kids running around making the hotel their playground.",Negative,,,,,
"The road noise was loud on the main street side of the hotel.
The food was marginal.
The elevators were slow.",Negative,,,,,
We had a corner room was nice. But prefer a suite with 2 rooms. When I leave early for meetings it is nice.,Positive,,,,,
rooms need to be remodeled with an emphasis on enlarging bathrooms,Neutral,,,,,
the toilet in the bathroom was shorter then normal. for a 6ft 4in tall person it was very difficult to sit and stand. they were smaller than normal.,Negative,,,,,
"Parking is extremely inconvenient. Having to go back and forth from parking ramp rather than having a big enough lot is less than ideal. No idea of this until we got there and couldnâ€™t find a spot. We had to call inside and ask where to go. Also, every hotel weâ€™ve ever stayed at allows for over the phone check out, which we did here but we were not allowed to just leave our room cards inside the room on the desk. We had to come back down to floor one to drop them off, go back up to get our bags, then go back to floor 2 to get to skywalk and walk to ramp. Again, very inconvenient",Positive,,,,,
Our in-room fridge did not work and a new one was brought to our room and replaced the unit that did not operate in a very timely manner.  Nice job.,Positive,,,,,
Posted hours of operation for the restaurant and bar was not accurate. this portion of the business was 30 minutes late to open.,Positive,,,,,
Mattress was very uncomfortable,Negative,,,,,
"Hotel was old, dark, and very dingy",Negative,,,,,
"asked for quite room b/c i have trouble sleeping, and was given room on freeway side of hotel",Negative,,,,,
"great staff, great stay!!",Positive,,,,,
My handicap-accessible room that was booked in advance was not available upon arrival. Staff was helpful getting us a shower chair and toilet seat riser but not having a walk-in shower as promised put my wife and I in some unsafe and compromising situations. Safety of guests should be a high priority that was not considered when our promised room was not available.,Positive,,,,,
I've been going to this hotel for years for a reason. I really like this property for its condition and the staff really care about you. I always feel well taken care of at this property.,Positive,,,,,
Check in was extremely slow,Negative,,,,,
Lose the charge for parking and make sure there are enough spaces in the main parking lot for actual guests of the hotel.,Positive,,,,,
We could not control the temperature in our room. It was to warm for us to sleep well.,Positive,,,,,
The room was not quite at all.  You need to change the window to be more sound proof.,Neutral,,,,,
"Road noise disruptive all night.
Rooms were supposed to be blocked nearby each other but were not. Elevators overworked causing longer delays. Did not get clear info on where to go for event or breakfast or vending or pool or gym. Tv guide?",Negative,,,,,
"When people reserve their room (king size) months in advance they should get what they reserved, we had two queens but then there was a cancellation and we got a king, but they told me that 7 people that reserved king beds were not going to get them and that is totally unacceptable that kind of stuff should never happen.",Positive,,,,,
Didnâ€™t get a copy of bill sent to email ad of yet,Positive,,,,,
Very disappointed to see the bar was closed with the Milwaukee Bucks being in a game 7,Negative,,,,,
We were either misinformed or misunderstood that breakfast would be available in the morning.  We understood the food accommodation to be closed.  Not sure what happened in that communication.,Positive,,,,,
Just an excellent place to stay!,Positive,,,,,
Stay was great. We were there for a wedding. I realize companies are short on staff as we waited for an hour and a half to finally have our entree. Didnâ€™t finish eating until after 8.  Also could have used more bartenders. Food was ok.,Positive,,,,,
All around pleasant experience,Positive,,,,,
It was not a great experience and I had been looking forward to the quiet stay to rest up. My husband had cancer surgery near by at BELLIN Hospital and it had been a stressful day there.,Negative,,,,,
"The room was awesome, loved everything about it. The very large tv was a fab surprise. 
We didn't do much in the facility to provide feedback (dining, front desk, etc). I will for sure stay at this property on our next visit to GB.",Positive,,,,,
Always try to stay at the Hyatt Green Bay when we come to town to visit our children and grandchildren,Positive,,,,,
Never have I stayed in a motel that was quiet time at 9pm we got in trouble for laughing in our room. At 9:02pm. Like really. We were not loud 3 adults sober having a conversation with giggles.  I worked at motel for 11 years never in my life would we have yelled at someone to be quiet at 9,Positive,,,,,
"It was overall a pleasant experience - something I expect from Hyatt, although the breakfast was lacking",Positive,,,,,
The free breakfast process is annoying. If you are entitled to free breakfast you should be given a physical voucher so it isnâ€™t charged to to our room. We got an additional charge for a breakfast that was supposed to be free,Positive,,,,,
Clean rooms daily.,Positive,,,,,
"The toilet was very loose and I was always afraid it was going to fall over. The room needed maintenance and an update. Just old and run down, especially the bathroom.",Negative,,,,,
The hotel is really starting to look old and dingy,Negative,,,,,
Staff was friendly and helpful. Disappointed with no lunge service on Sunday.,Positive,,,,,
I've stayed at your hotel a few times in the last couple years before covid.  Was always happy with my room.  This time I received a regular room when I was expecting the standard rooms where bedrooms are separate than couch and kitchen area.  Just really disappointed.  Was going to ask to change rooms but we were in a hurry once we arrived and had to go right away.,Positive,,,,,
Just additional kudos to Paul for saving the day as we booked last-minute and for Madison being so kind and helpful at check-in.,Positive,,,,,
Bathroom is too small,Neutral,,,,,
This was the worst Hyatt experience and I have traveled the world many times. I canâ€™t believe Hyatt would have their name on this operation.,Negative,,,,,
We had a great stay. Thank you.,Positive,,,,,
"We had issues with checkin. We had reserved adjoining rooms with another couple we were with, and despite assurances weâ€™d be accommodated, they had booked the adjoining room out. We were downgraded as a result to a far lesser room than the executive suite we had booked. Very disappointed.",Negative,,,,,
"Needs and update, beds, bedding good, Gym very good equipment",Positive,,,,,
"The entire staff that I encountered were professional, friendly and efficient",Positive,,,,,
It was a great hotel! We really enjoyed our stay,Positive,,,,,
Just OK.,Negative,,,,,
Not prepared for amount of guests registered per room,Positive,,,,,
"I am NOT happy that they charge $100 for my pet. When booking, the hotel website did not tell me there is a fee! All it said was pet friendly!!!",Positive,,,,,
all good,Positive,,,,,
"Wanted to pay cash in ""The Market"" but they didn't have cash on hand....had to use my credit card.  Drinks are too expensive in The Pub.  Could tell server at the reception hated his job.  Asked for coffee and he served 4 other tables before he poured me a COLD cup of coffee.  No butter or sour cream for baked potatoes.  No knife for the steak.  Not enough servers (or maybe ours was too slow) for the number of people at the reception.",Negative,,,,,
recognized as globalist and given suite upgrade,Neutral,,,,,
It was the best experience for our daughterâ€™s wedding. My compliments to everyone.,Positive,,,,,
"Lobby looked fresh, new and modern.",Positive,,,,,
Great stay,Positive,,,,,
Everything  was wonderful. Keep up the good work.,Positive,,,,,
Breakfast was the only problem. I ordered eggs over very easy. Came back hard eggs. I did not say anything because our waitress was extremely busy. Bacon was 1 piece and half of another. My only complaint.,Positive,,,,,
"I have not stayed in downtown Green Bay before. Did not love the location -- not much to see or do, although your receptionist directed me to a good restaurant.",Positive,,,,,
"During check-in, both associated were extraordinarily helpful, kind, and professional.",Positive,,,,,
"We were disappointed to find that the hot tub was closed, even though the swimming pool was open.",Negative,,,,,
Carpet in 231 needs to be streched,Neutral,,,,,
"The breakfast was yummy, but it would be nice if you used reusable cups at breakfast! The amount of plastic was alarming and disappointing.",Positive,,,,,
There was a over powering smell to the room....that never really went away.,Positive,,,,,
Please see Google Maps review.,Positive,,,,,
"Bedding was not tucked in properly. 
Sheets were not wide enough. 

I would return if there were no dogs allowed.",Positive,,,,,
The pet deposit is WAY too high!,Negative,,,,,
Enjoyed the stay!!,Positive,,,,,
LOVED IT!!! We will be back!,Positive,,,,,
Check in took way to long only 1 person working the counter and had 10 people in line waiting to check in. Whats the point of online check in if we still have to wait in line to get keys.,Positive,,,,,
without Paul's attention we may have been disappointed with our stay,Negative,,,,,
I didn't realize that the refrigerator was turned off.,Neutral,,,,,
"Room wasnâ€™t ready for a pre-arranged early check-in, in fact, it wasnâ€™t ready until almost an hour after standard 3pm check-in time. We had traveled several hours to attend a wedding event and needed to change and freshen up and instead ended up more sweaty.",Positive,,,,,
The biggest issue is that the toilets are lower than standard toilets and it is very hard to stand up from them. Especially if you have knee problems.,Negative,,,,,
very happy,Positive,,,,,
Wonderful,Positive,,,,,
See previous complaint,Negative,,,,,
Scott in the bar was wonderful when I ordered a pizza for my child. He provided very positive and very proactive service. I was impressed.,Positive,,,,,
I wish we were able to stay longer. 5 stars from top to bottom!,Positive,,,,,
Raw bacon on BLT was quickly resolved.,Positive,,,,,
Enjoy every minute,Positive,,,,,
We were pleasantly surprised that you have the low-profile bed in the handicapped accessible room we had. This is a first in all the hotels we have stayed in for lions conventions (17 conventions) in the last 6 years.  Thank you!,Positive,,,,,
Honestly I would have expected there to at least be some kind of free breakfast but there wasnâ€™t. The mention of the wheelchair by the employee was totally embarrassing for me.,Positive,,,,,
This was sent to Glen Spring at the e-mail address for Walt Althaus - Walt is answering this survey as Glen does not have an e-mail address.  Please change your information as I am not sure how Glen would answer this survey.,Positive,,,,,

"Was not happy the first morning when I turned on the shower and brown water came out. It did clean up after a minute, but this made me think when was the last time the room was cleaned?",Positive,,,,,
The night stand between the bed - lower shelf very dusty.,Negative,,,,,
My wife uses a walker and the door into the bathroom was too narrow for the walker.,Neutral,,,,,
T V difficult to program,Negative,,,,,
Room was slightly run down. But it was okay. Maybe I should have reported that the edging under the bar was hanging by a thread. Housecleaning should have seen that when vacuuming though.,Negative,,,,,
"staff worked very hard to fix elevator for us,  wew walked around to other side finally as he still had problems",Negative,,,,,
"The elevators are extreamly slow. This was even more evident when many of us were checking out, especially when one of the elevators jammed with people in it.",Negative,,,,,
"We conduct many workshop, seminars and events and would have iked to have had a better experience during our visit.",Positive,,,,,
The property is tired and the rooms need renovation.,Positive,,,,,
"We had breakfast one morning.  Our order was ""lost by the computer"" and we waited 45 minutes for food while others that arrived after us received their food long before we did.  The biscuits and gravy were terrible and my wife's pancakes were the consistency of rubber.",Positive,,,,,
"Time to move forward with loosening your COVID protocols/restrictions/closings of amenities. The CDC is. Time to open your hot tub, sauna, and continental breakfast.",Positive,,,,,
The service  at breakfast  was the worst I had every had . She was rude and she was never there she gave us the wrong check so we played it and she hunt us down and was so rude about the wrong bill then went to pay it I gave her my card and she was mad about having to go back to the restaurant  and come back where I was to sing it the food was ok but she was horrible,Negative,,,,,
Favorite hotel in green bay only thing I would change is upgrade all the rooms with big tvs and some patio doors open all the way witch means someone took the stopper off,Positive,,,,,
AS usual not enough time to tame in swimming area. Next time.,Positive,,,,,
The speed of your elevators is very slow!,Negative,,,,,
Amazing,Positive,,,,,
Beautiful hotel and rooms with great service and breakfast.  Rooms are very spacious with a great bar.,Positive,,,,,
"I was very disappointed with the staff or their ability to help us find restaurants or food delivery.  The woman at the front desk basically suggested we order any chain delivery.  She apologized saying she didn't live in that area.  But isn't that her JOB to know, especially when the hotel is in an area with few restaurants esp of the chain type?  

The breakfast was beautiful, but so oily that it was like a hot ball of wax in our stomachs.",Positive,,,,,
Felt safe and if nicier out we would probably had walked places instead of driving,Positive,,,,,
"Frustrating that the pool wasnâ€™t open until 10 am. With check out time being 11, it really didnâ€™t leave much time.",Negative,,,,,

Was impressed to see added amenities in the snack/drink area compared to our first stay weeks prior. Would like to see more options in the future as well!,Positive,,,,,
"Noisy due to slamming doors in stairwell or next door, not sure which!? Rain caused dripping over the downspouts and against sliding doors. Those I know are mostly outside of your control but wanted to mention.",Negative,,,,,
See other comments,Neutral,,,,,
Miss the breakfast,Positive,,,,,
This hotel was chosen as part of a block for a wedding. It's an old Embassy Suites that has been several different brands over time. It's really out of date and past its prime regardless of how many coats of paint you use.,Positive,,,,,
The elevator extremely slow .,Negative,,,,,
Our stay was very nice.  The elevators were a bit of an issue on Sunday though with the amount of people.,Positive,,,,,
Nothing to say.,Positive,,,,,
I was quite surprised and pleased at how lovely the team was at this property. We are LIFETIME Bonvoy members ( old Marriott Platinum LIFETIME) and the Marriott Residence Inn staff was SO RUDE to us we decided to re-start our World of Hyatt relationship. Glad we did!,Positive,,,,,
"The furniture could use an update, as it looked to be well used. The toilet was loose from the floor, also could use and update, (such as comfort height).",Positive,,,,,

"real glass, ink pen,paper,were missed for  what I would normally expect",Negative,,,,,
My stay was fine but on checking out I have won a free nights stay from a raffle our function was running that was supplied by the hotel but on leaving was told the free night had to be used on our next visit .. living hundreds of miles away this was not possible and we were told at the time we picked the prize it had to be used on  THIS STAY I assume because we had a group rate .. if you came back at another time the price would be different .. after about 15 minutes are arguing the manager accepted the certificate but it was a little annoying and upsetting. but it finally worked out,Positive,,,,,
Communication regarding breakfast was horrible.  Stay on hold with room service and then lobby before anyone answered the phone.,Negative,,,,,
Bathroom need improve.,Positive,,,,,
No paper towel in room,Neutral,,,,,
Working elevators needed. Broken and challenging.,Neutral,,,,,
"The public spaces were great, but I can't get over how yucky the room was.  There really need to be grab bars in the bath!",Negative,,,,,
We love the suites and rooms.  The noise problem on weekend nights makes it unpleasant with kids running around the floors and screaming.,Positive,,,,,
"breakfast service was slow, though staff did the best they could with the crowd",Positive,,,,,
"I enjoyed my stay.  I appreciated the 25% discount for breakfast.  The food was very good.  However when I got ready to pay the bill and put it as a room charge I was SHOCKED.  This is the FIRST hotel that was going to charge me 18% plus some fixed fee to charge breakfast to my room.  I think the total came to $2.16.  I paid with a credit card to avoid the ridiculous fee.  I would like to know the genesis who came up with this idea.  I guess it is like the ""occupancy tax"" tacked onto your room rate.  I guess the room rate allows you to open the door and look in, but before you can enter you are charged an occupancy tax.  Sure would be nice to see the USA wakeup and do things like they do in Europe.  The rate for the room covers EVERYTHING-all hidden fees even including the 14% VAT!!",Positive,,,,,
Would have been nice if someone made sure I was ok after being stuck in the elevator. Maybe a free Starbucks or breakfast. Otherwise everything was excellent.,Positive,,,,,
"We had great cooperation as necessary, with our Titletown Trade-A-Thon show.  As one of the TAT committee, I had occasion interact with a number of your staff and to ask questions, or get help, and the response was always positive.",Positive,,,,,
The room was pretty clean except for some hair on the bathroom walls and tub.,Positive,,,,,
Hotel needs a facelift,Negative,,,,,
"Upon check in, 1 of the 4 elevators we working. The staff didn't even seem to know about the issue. I had to carry my luggage up 4 flights of stairs to get to my room due to elevator issues. The mobile card didn't work for the door to the stairs or the parking gate which was inconvenient. It required me to get a physical key which then deactivated my mobile key.",Neutral,,,,,
Your front Dess man I forgot his name was really helpful to me with signing me up for Hyatt rewards without me even asking and knowing about it hats off to that man I forgot his name,Positive,,,,,
Nice hotel but kids seem to do what ever they want.,Positive,,,,,
Please vacuum the hair out of the pool more often. It was gross to the point I had to get out,Neutral,,,,,
The waitress never checked on us after she brought our food after we were done eating and getting up she then brought us the check,Positive,,,,,
Explain the meal program better,Positive,,,,,
"We loved our stay!  We couldnâ€™t get the Chromecast to work in the living room but it worked just fine in the bedroom, but no big deal at all!

Our check in and check in ladies were super friendly and helpful. 

Paul reaching out ahead of our stay was a very kind gesture and is why we love our Hyatts.",Positive,,,,,

Had a great time. and will see you next April,Positive,,,,,
"Staff was excellent across the board, very professional and kind. I was very disappointed that could not manage the temperature of my room. That was a first for me after traveling to 39 states and 7 countries.",Positive,,,,,
We were more than satisfied with our stay and the staff.,Positive,,,,,
"Hot tub could be re-opened. Other chains have hot tubs open.

Didnâ€™t understand breakfast option. Should be able to add that at breakfast.

Was disapponted not being able to get late check-out, at last minute. I could understand it was last minite.",Positive,,,,,
Overall stay was great. Bar needed to be stocked more for the people that were staying there.  Bartender Amazing he was!,Positive,,,,,
Food and bar not very good.  No good wine - only cheap or sweet wines and very limited liquor availability.  (I don't think I have ever been to a bar that does not have Tanqueray. ) Not sure about beer selection...did not pay attention to that.,Positive,,,,,
We were there for a dance competition but will be back just to relax.,Positive,,,,,
I was disappointed,Negative,,,,,
See previous comment re dirty stray sock,Positive,,,,,
Very noisy and doors are constantly slammed by other guests.  Not a pleasant sleeping experience at all.,Positive,,,,,
"Everyone we asked for help or supplies was very nice, responsive, and made sure we found what we needed.",Positive,,,,,
"Room was King Suite (room 801) but bed was definitly a Queen. Not a big deal, just incorrect advertisement.",Negative,,,,,

"It is really noisy at night, walls are paper thin and posted quiet hours did not seem to apply.",Negative,,,,,
It is a very nice hotel. The food is good but very expensive. It was very loud at night until almost midnight with kids yelling and running the halls,Positive,,,,,
Declaration of the cost of incidentals available for viewing at reservation time and at check-in. I have never had to pay for incidentals up front and then wait for someone to check on my room on departure.,Negative,,,,,
Think Iâ€™ve said enough,Negative,,,,,
We stayed here for a dance competition. The front desk definitely could have used more staff members present as their was typically always a line. I asked for a noon check out and was told that since I was a World of Hyatt member that it could be accommodated. Unfortunately I was locked out of my room at 11:00. Room keeping could not let me in and the line was long at the front desk. I stood on line and it caused us to be late to my daughters dance competition group. Iâ€™m hoping for a better experience at the end of April because we will be staying here again for another competition.,Positive,,,,,
This used to be a great place to stay and the breakfast was amazing.  Even with COVID...and now that things are loosening up...there has to be more that can be done about breakfast.,Positive,,,,,
Gentleman at the desk was very friendly and informative.,Positive,,,,,
Should have never took the palm trees down. Main lobby area looks too plain.,Positive,,,,,
"Very nice. I checked in for some time away from the kids. I'm glad I was able to afford the stay & I really had space to relax. I had hoped the hot tub & those areas were open , but hey I understand. The price & the rest of the time was was a pleasure.",Positive,,,,,
The whole hotel experience was awesome.,Positive,,,,,
Great hotel,Positive,,,,,
I was disappointed to have to pay for parking and breakfast,Negative,,,,,
Never received a email with my charge. Had to call customer service and look up my bill online to find out I was overcharged.,Positive,,,,,
The Starbucks coffee was not as good as a typical Starbucks,Positive,,,,,
Only complaint we have is when we texted for coffee and received a msg 4 hrs later that it would be delivered shortly. Was never delivered over the next 16-24 hrs of our stay.,Negative,,,,,
No need to call or contact me just clean the rooms better please,Positive,,,,,
"My kids loved it. Staff was attentive, pleasant and helpful.",Positive,,,,,
It was a great stay as always. Just felt like housekeeping kinda rushed to clean our room. Dust and hair.,Positive,,,,,
Great stay. Hair dryer cord super short,Positive,,,,,
"My kids prefer this Hyatt for our GBay stays. I watch the price for a week and it stayed relatively high. On my drive to GBay on Friday, I noticed the price dropped by approx. $69/night AND INCLUDED FREE breakfast, which is what we're accustomed to. Instead, we paid $69/night more with NO breakfast. It was too late cancel since the price didn't drop until after the cancellation time. Extremely frustrating. Not really happy with our stay.",Positive,,,,,
"Our room temperature was too cold. Call the front desk, and ask for a blanket. There services was speedy got it done right away.",Positive,,,,,
Great experience,Positive,,,,,
"Love the manager, Paul. What a professional, kind man. Felt so welcomed with his comforting voice and Excellent suggestions. Made our experience even better.",Positive,,,,,
"The rooms could've been a little cleaner, the shower head was pretty rusty and loose from the wall, the floor wasn't super clean.",Positive,,,,,
"Room was huge, loved it. Bathroom was crazy tiny and looked patched in.",Negative,,,,,
I know it's a lot to ask for more elevators but standing in line for 20 minutes for an elevator is grueling after a long day of travel. Also the pet fee is way too expensive.,Negative,,,,,
"My reserved room with 2 beds was given away and I was offered a kind and sofa bed option. 
There was no parking available at the hotel, I had to park in the garage across the street. 
The restaurant stopped serving food at 9:00pm. 
The hotel was very noisy and I could hear the man in the next room speak very well through closed doors.",Positive,,,,,
Need more carts to carry things in.,Neutral,,,,,
Elevators need to be updated! Breakfast took over an hour to get.,Positive,,,,,
Be up from with all the extra surge charges. For example parking and early check in.,Positive,,,,,
Stricter measures on guests who should be wearing masks at all times,Neutral,,,,,
Overall it was a great experience.  Close to shopping and restaurants.,Negative,,,,,
"My husband and I always ""COVID-CLEAN"" our hotel rooms when we stay somewhere, wipe down every surface, the phone, door knobs, bathrooms, clean the toilet and all touch points.  We even did this before covid.  We found our room to be very clean.",Positive,,,,,
Didnâ€™t appreciate the mask mandate. Should be choice!!!,Positive,,,,,
Front desk staff was very nice and pleasant!,Positive,,,,,
Food options were very limited.  There were not very many kid friendly options.,Positive,,,,,
"I did want to register a complaint about the service we got at the bar/restaurant located on site. The server, Steve, provided terrible service. It was as if we were irritating him because we were there. I know its a hard job and I think they may have been under staffed? because they weren't overly busy but it took an hour for our food to come. Also, I stopped in earlier to check on the food allergy concerns and he told me straight out that they anticipated being super busy so there were there restaurants near there we could walk to.",Negative,,,,,
"The market employee could use some training in customer service, blaming me for miscommunication when she misheard me and then got short with me. Otherwise everyone else at the desk and throughout the hotel was professional",Negative,,,,,
Loud banging noises very army in morning.  Bad experience with food and service in pub333.,Negative,,,,,
"The room was fine and the front office staff were fantastic! We ate dinner at the restaurant and the food was not good at all and the wait was very long. Breakfast was better, at least. There was no decaf coffee at The Market.",Positive,,,,,
We had a nice time.  We liked the spaciousness of our room.  I wish the bathroom was a little larger.  We would stay again and I would still recommend the hotel.,Positive,,,,,
"There were so many kids running up and down the halls, slamming doors, and riding elevators.  It felt like a zoo.  Breakfast was overpriced for the quality.  We usually stay at the Hilton because it has a well-adjusted atmosphere.  They Hyatt felt like that initially, but we quickly found no rest.",Positive,,,,,
We could hear our neighbors in the next room as if they were in our room.,Neutral,,,,,
I love to place I thought the Room was very nice. Staff were very friendly.,Positive,,,,,
"One of your house keeping or maintenance people tried to enter my room while I was in bed. I heard a bunch of banging type noise from the front of my room. He had swiped his key which unlocked my door. I had the safety latch hooked which stopped my door from opening over a couple of inches. Your worker stuck his fingers in the door and was trying repeatedly to unlatch the safety catch. When I unlatched the catch and opened the door and ask if I could help him he was startled. He pulled a piece of paper from his pocket, looked at my door number, said he was sorry and walked off. What the heck was he thinking, when the safety latch stopped the door from opening he should of stopped and revealed the situation.",Negative,,,,,
Masks requirements need to be ended.,Negative,,,,,
Would come again the staff on that day we checked in great the young lady who we ordered breakfast with outstanding,Positive,,,,,
We got food poisoning from the in-house restaurant. The food tasted good but later that night and the next day we where both sick.,Negative,,,,,
The only complaint we had was the limited hours in the pool. There was event going on in the area and the pool was packed with children the entire time we were there. Would be nice to have even an hour in the evening for adults only.,Negative,,,,,
"Please add a warmer, real converter. The knit one in extra bedding had stains on it. 
Staff was overworked running desk & coffee shop. Pleasant front desk staff & housekeeper on 4th floor.",Positive,,,,,
"Hotel was full of screaming young ladies due to a gymnastics event being held in green bay, people running in hallways and doors slamming until 11pm. We have been staying at this hotel for 15 yrs, this was by far the worst it has been.. Total zoo, causal areas (lobby atrium) of hotel was taken over by parents. And pool had 50 plus people in it. So much for considering others with social distancing.",Negative,,,,,
I like this hotel,Positive,,,,,
it was just unbelievably noisy - kids running and yelling until late in the night and the traffic noise outside was unbearable - not really the hotels fault but it would be a reason I would not stay there again...,Negative,,,,,
Excellent quality overall,Positive,,,,,
"We were very pleased with our stay, looking forward to the next visit.",Positive,,,,,
It's fine and if the rate is about the same in June will stay there again.,Negative,,,,,
"Complimentary breakfast, reasonable market prices",Positive,,,,,
There was a swimsuit bottom on the shelf in the closet when we checked in.,Neutral,,,,,
Nice place.,Negative,,,,,
"The room looked amazing until you got in the bathroom. Our bathroom you could tell was just updated to look good. Not really updated, they just went over the old plus it was super small.",Positive,,,,,
The bathroom vent under the sink needed to be cleaned in room 805.,Negative,,,,,
Christine and Tracey were fantastic.  Thank you!,Positive,,,,,
"I think the bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever experienced.  I usually don't sleep well my first night in a hotel, but at your hotel, I slept better than I sleep at home. :)",Positive,,,,,
It was a bit loud and echoed quite a bit from the people who were in the open area on the first floor.,Negative,,,,,
Tv was smaller than expected in living area. Enjoyed the huge tv in bedroom. Teenagers wanted to watch Basketball games on our tv.,Positive,,,,,
Loved it. We will be back next time in town.,Positive,,,,,
"I thoroughly enjoyed my lovely sweet, the television was fantastic and the comfort was great. The staff was very friendly",Positive,,,,,
"Was not happy with no breakfast, cold shower and I was changed more then I expected for.",Positive,,,,,
Excellent hotel and staff!!,Positive,,,,,
"We went down for coffee and breakfast to the little store by the front desk. We got down there at 630 and apparently it didn't open till 7 (although the signs said open 24 hrs). the lady was rude when I asked if I could get a coffee, the donut holes for my son's were stale, and the yogurt and fruit was very overpriced.",Negative,,,,,
"I was told due to Covid, there were no tissues in the rooms anymore.  this is crazy.  plenty of other Hyatts (and ones in Wisconsin) still have them.  Also I was told the rooms wouldn't have bottles of water in the room.  Again, nonsense.",Positive,,,,,
"I know rooms havenâ€™t been occupied, however it would be wise to dust on a most consistent basis.  Otherwise, everything else was clean.",Positive,,,,,
wish the restaurant had been open. was surprised to see it was closed.,Positive,,,,,
Please see my previous comments,Positive,,,,,
"It's a very awesome place and my daughter enjoyed swimming the breakfast was delicious. The beds were comfy bathroom could have just been tad bit bigger but whatever, lol.",Positive,,,,,
Very good and relaxing,Positive,,,,,
Keep the Green Bay touch!,Neutral,,,,,
We did not really have hot water for showers.,Negative,,,,,
"The rooms were a bit warm, even lowering the thermostat, the room did not cool much.",Positive,,,,,
The elevator broke down on the day we were leaving so that was hard. But overall it was a good experience,Negative,,,,,
Excellent,Positive,,,,,
Maybe have adult hours where kids aren't allowed in the pool. So customers who are staying without kids can enjoy the pool as well.,Positive,,,,,
"I am very concerned about the overloading of electrical outlets in my room and by extention all the rooms.  When individual outlets have devices plugged in 3 deep in some instances it IS an electrical hazard - and I am surprised the local fire marshal would allow it.  The rooms are neat, clean, but the number of devices (microwave, min-fridge, lamps, clocks, night-llights, etc) in one room is frightening.  I notice because I am an electrical engineer, and flat out there are too many electrical devices for the number of electrical outlets.",Negative,,,,,
Your bar needs more variety of beverages,Positive,,,,,
Hyatt sets the standard in hotel stays,Neutral,,,,,
We enjoyed every moment that we were there.,Positive,,,,,
"Paul was super friendly at the front desk! He took some extra time to chat about the Packers, and helped me get checked out quickly!",Positive,,,,,
"The bed's were very comfortable, not worn out.",Positive,,,,,
Great as always,Positive,,,,,
Horrible,Negative,,,,,
very nice accommodations,Positive,,,,,
Fantastic service and really nice property.  Awesome value.  We came to swim and visit family.  We had family staying in another room down the hall.  Breakfast is amazing.  Very popular area in the morning.,Positive,,,,,
Why are the bathroom toilets so low?,Negative,,,,,
My suggestion is to be upfront honest about parking costs and what amenities you do and do not have.,Negative,,,,,
Great,Positive,,,,,
"Staff was great
Especially Bertha",Positive,,,,,
Pool area could have an adult hour and the hot tub was not warm enough,Neutral,,,,,
Extraordinary,Positive,,,,,
There were two things in the room that did not work and when I called the front desk they were excellent and got ahold of Maintenance and the maintenance man was fantastic~~ he responded within 10 minutes and had the shower fixed in like 10 minutes and replaced the refrigerator because the door would not shut,Positive,,,,,
The room was freezing cold in the bedroom area.,Negative,,,,,
Better than expected and was very well pleased with the restraunt and pool area and most of all the space in the room.plus the price,Positive,,,,,
Room carpeting needs replacement,Neutral,,,,,
The employees at checkin in gave me a completely different answer on parking then when I went to check out so they had to straighten out my parking.your hotel was rented out so I couldnâ€™t stay the 2nd night but employees kept giving us all different answers about us using the lobby.  The connection to the conference center was shutdown which was a main reason I stayed there.  Employees seemed to be confused and gave differing answers on questions.,Positive,,,,,
"We understand it is difficult to have the restaurant open regular hours during this time, but 5-8 the weekend of a game isn't very good planning. We had to order food out every time we ate.",Positive,,,,,
"Zero communication on breakfast, offer of breakfast or coffee",Positive,,,,,
"Not sure what else could be done on Wyatt's part, but there were quite a few guests not wearing masks in communal areas.",Positive,,,,,
Waited over hour for breakfast.  Asked twice and then third time they took action.  Also not have fitness center open until 10 am makes no sense.  When I said something at breakfast she said i should have went to front desk and they would have let me in.  How would I have known that so I went to a local gym.  Then I asked to talk to GM and they said she was there but not working.  If you were slammed every manager should have been there.  You were my go to hotel in Green Bay but we will not be back.,Positive,,,,,
Please open the pub again on Thursdays.,Positive,,,,,
I was so impressed that whoever reads these surveys really care about them.  Last time I had put in the survey about not having paper towels in the room and no water and when we got to our room the maid brought us water and paper towels and I had not asked for them at the hotel~~that would maybe be a small item to most people but not to me IT SHOWED THAT THEY REALLY DO CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS,Positive,,,,,
Fire hazard behind night stands.   Ridiculous charges that were not told to us prior to arrival.   Furnishings had child and dents all over them. Got charged 4 times.,Negative,,,,,
should be free parking since you could want customers during COVID time,Positive,,,,,
"Customer service was good. Hot tub wouldn't stay on longer then 2 minutes. I thought the breakfast was included and was the charged 34 dollars, I even asked ahead of time. And the found out we had to pay for parking which I didnt understand. Very beautiful hotel though.",Positive,,,,,
Room could been hot but heat wasn't working well.,Positive,,,,,
I love the hotel,Positive,,,,,
"We were there for my son's wedding.  The only issue we had was inconsistent food quality at the wedding..mine was great.  My husband's steak was tough.  The chicken was not the option that the bride and groom chose.  Delicious, but not what was expected.  Everything else went well!  Very helpful staff!",Positive,,,,,
Paul at the front desk was a delight to work with. Very accommodating.,Positive,,,,,
It was wonderful!! Staff very friendly and accommodating.,Positive,,,,,
Absolutely love this place!,Positive,,,,,
Not sure if weâ€™ll return.,Neutral,,,,,
"I have stayed at this hotel several times before and never been dissatisfied. This place has lost its luster. The room felt like it hadn't been taken care of in ages. Carpet coming up from the floor, stains on the lamp shades, and an overall lack of cleanliness. These concerns were brought up to on premises staff and I feel they were adequately acknowledged. But I feel that it's important for the information to be conveyed through this Medium as well",Positive,,,,,
overall hyatt regency is nice at all.,Positive,,,,,
Breakfast eggs were awful. Over all breakfast food quality was sub par.,Positive,,,,,
I wrote a complainant due to multiple issues with cleaning babies in the hot tub and ping children and open exercise doors and parking charges and gate not going up,Negative,,,,,
We booked the breakfast rate and it wasn't noticed at check in and was billed to our account and had to be manually removed by staff when I noticed it at check out.,Positive,,,,,
The bartender and the receptionist were both very kind and helpful!,Positive,,,,,
Great experience - appreciated getting an upgrade as a Globalist member. Everyone was friendly and helpful.,Positive,,,,,
"The fact that you expect guests to pay ten dollars a day is a joke. We used the ramp, but there was confusion about how to deal with it after 6 am on a Monday.",Positive,,,,,
The staff is always friendly and awesome.,Positive,,,,,
Staff was very accommodating to our needs.  Our coffee maker wasn't working and we got a new one in a matter of minutes.  Everyone was super friendly and very attentive.  The staff for breakfast and in the pub were friendly and went above and beyond with their hospitality.,Positive,,,,,
The staff accomodated us with a room change due to dissatisfaction with corner space,Negative,,,,,
"Would have been nice if the kids area in pool had been working.
Donâ€™t think you should charge for parking.",Positive,,,,,
The hotel is beautiful. The staff are friendly and helpful.  The breakfast buffet was delicious.,Positive,,,,,
Thanks for such a great stay!,Positive,,,,,
Hotel needs a update and the food is not great.,Positive,,,,,
The staff was so friendly!,Positive,,,,,
Low rating was only due to the good and a cesssbility,Positive,,,,,
Breakfast should be complimentary,Positive,,,,,
Very nice hotel!,Positive,,,,,
I love this hotel. It is our go to in Green bay,Positive,,,,,

"Special recognition for James.  He is always warm, welcoming, and helpful when I check in.",Positive,,,,,
"The manager refused to give us bottled water on Monday while we were in the lobby, apparently we were not â€œthe right membersâ€ to receive a complimentary bottle.",Positive,,,,,
Hyatt member - thought would have water in room. Did not.,Negative,,,,,
"Rooms need some general maintenance, deep cleaning and repair/refreshing. Front desk staff was very unfamiliar with local area including bars and restaurants. Cost for value seemed a bit high for a 3 star hotel. Trying to impress business clients and this was avg at best.",Positive,,,,,
Samantha at the front desk was absolutely great. Super friendly and very helpful.,Positive,,,,,
Bring back shuttle,Neutral,,,,,
"Very nice stay in GB, will be back!",Positive,,,,,
I am disabled and dependent on my wheelchair. James the manager was accommodating and very helpful. James and his staff memeber Miguel went above and beyond to make my experience the best it could be. Thank you!,Positive,,,,,
Rooms need a little updating.  Furniture is pretty beat up.,Positive,,,,,
"Overall, the experience was nice. Check in was easy, staff were extremely helpful, and breakfast was standard, nothing wrong with it at all. Regarding the room, it did seem dated. The shower could be updated to match the rest of the bathroom, the carpet updated, and the overall lighting in the room couldâ€™ve been better.",Positive,,,,,
"We had a very enjoyable stay, and weâ€™re especially pleased with the size and condition of our room. The only hiccup came when checking out. First, even though we chose the breakfast package we were charged for it. After that was resolved, our dinner for two was charged twice; that took 25 minutes to resolve, and involved finding another staff member.",Positive,,,,,
"I had to pay with cash, which is not a problem for me.  However, upon check-in they made me pay $300 extra for incidentals which is a ridiculous amount.  I don't know if I will stay at Hyatt ever again due to this.  I explained that my bank card was canceled by my bank and the staff didn't care.  I understand the need for incidental coverage but the amount left me with little cash available for my stay in Green Bay which was supposed to be a mini vacation for myself. I am upset.",Positive,,,,,
"stay in room 801, room was great except for 1 thing - there was no desk, or other suitable area, to do work on my laptop computer.",Positive,,,,,
This was truly the worst hotel stay in my entire life,Negative,,,,,
"Front desk, bar/restaurant and store staff were amazing. They were kind, considerate, helpful and pleasant. I stay there often and they are ALWAYS that way.",Positive,,,,,
"Smart TVs or a fire stick/roku/something to stream with was expected when we realized how upscale the hotel is. It would have been really nice to stream during our stay. Other than that, it exceeded our expectations immensely.",Positive,,,,,
Room was very dated.  Definitely did not meet the expectations I have for a Hyatt property.   Lobby area was nice but rooms were very dated and appeared dirty.   We would not even sit on the couch in the room.,Negative,,,,,
Replace the elevators. The wait time is to long. I should have to wait 10 minutes for an elevator.,Negative,,,,,
"It was a weird stay for us. I reserved 3 rooms for a famiily Christmas gathering and called ahead to confirm logistics and how breakfast would work. We had one hostess who was absolutley horrible to our family and refused to seat us together at the high tops with 8 seats. Day 1 we had a bunch of small tables while groups of 2s and 3s sat at the larger tables. The rest of the wait staff were amazing, engaging and interacted with us which made the experience much better. However, I did notice the hostess arguing with her manager about the situation later. Our sencond morning was a little better after my mother in law insisted on the large table for our group. While we were in 3 different rooms and called ahead to make sure our breakfast was included, one wasn't and when I asked at the front desk at check out was told I was wrong. They politely fixed trhe issue and I informed them that I called ahead to confirm so we could plan accordingly. The food, while good, was not worth the $16 buffett, but the servers were great. We had a couple of weird situations with my nephew who got locked out of his room and was questioned when he tried to join our table for breakfast. He is a black man with dreads which some of our group thought was an issue, I just hope and know that Hyatt would not have these issues. He had locked his key in the room and was given a very hard time trying to get a replacement. They could have easily called me to confirm but eventaully worked itself out when the manager working with the trainee worked through the issue. 

I called ahead to make sure everything was going as planned with the hotel staff but was told that we were not supposed to have breakfast included even though I paid for all the rooms (on my World of Hyatt card). I would like to point at that Zoe and the houskeeping staff did an amazing job of taking care of us. It was not all negative; just a few weird moments I wanted to share. I had a conversation with the front desk when I checked out about some bad breakfast charges and was told I was wrong even after every meal was included over the past 2 days (Which we are all very grateful for!). The manager on duty was going to follow up about the rules to make sure they were all on the same page. I even made sure that some of the family who arrived late were also properly charged after we received a check with the wrong total. We were always open and honest about our group. 

In closing, I love Hyatt hotels and is why I stay at one every chance I can when away from home. As a marketing/event manager, I bring all the business I can to Hyatt because it is always the best exerience for our team and guests. I was just a little let down this weekend BUT will be back because I love Hyatt and know it will be better next time. Again, it was a good experience for me; we just had some issues with our group, the logistics, and the hostess running the breakfast buffet. Until next time!!",Positive,,,,,
I enjoyed my stay with the service member/ government discount. Thank you for the dedicated support for the troops.,Positive,,,,,
"Every member of staff was friendly, kind, and helpful. The room was very clean, comfortable, and much more spacious than expected. Thanks for a great stay!",Positive,,,,,
"Parking should be free for overnight guests, since you have plenty of room.  Parking fees when we are already paying for the room and taxes and service fees just seems like an additional money grab.",Positive,,,,,
"At check-in, the attendant asked if we had parked. I said yes, and she said we needed to validate. The next morning, I went out to the car to get my ticket and brought it to the front desk. A different attendant was there and told me since I was in the parking garage, I didn't need to get it validated. I wasted about 15 minutes because of this simple miscommunication. While I recognize it's not that much time, it would have been nice to not have to rush to get out the door that morning.
We won't be returning if we can help it.",Positive,,,,,
Very Odd experience with hostess for breakfast.  Wouldnâ€™t let my kid eat with us because of numbers,Positive,,,,,
Friendly professional staff. Beautiful facility and room.,Positive,,,,,
I wish breakfast was buffet or grab and go. I only had a few minutes,Positive,,,,,
We booked through hotels.com and I needed my wife to be there at checkin to verify. Process was not accommodating and frustrating. Good thing she was able to take my phone call to talk with the front desk.,Positive,,,,,
Samantha was great. However the phone in my room did not work and the sliding glass door didn't close tight. I was really cold the whole night.,Positive,,,,,
Parking was kind of confusing.  Had to pay to exit in addition to paying at check in. Give guests a pass or ability to use key to park.,Positive,,,,,
The staff was cheerful and helpful. The hotel was clean. One of the best experiences in a hotel for our family.,Positive,,,,,
Tv more complicated than needed. Breakfast to expensive for cold food.,Negative,,,,,
Had to call front desk 3 times over a 3-hour period to get someone to explain how the thermostat works and finally have maintenance come to our room,Positive,,,,,
"I would definitely stay again. Just not the same room as I continually heard elevator service equipment. Breakfast wasn't horrible, but the sausage was just not right, tasted off.",Positive,,,,,
"The breakfast was included in my stay. However, it was very confusing how it was processed because we were required to sign a bill at each breakfast. The day the breakfast was a la carte and allowed one choice the food was good. The additional days with the buffet it was horrible. I use to stay in Hyatt hotels 15-20 years ago, and they were great. This particular one is old and needs renovation. The check-in staff were excellent but the breakfast staff were in general rude. Thus, I don't plan on staying again in this hotel, even though the price of the stay was fairly reasonable. I rather pay a little more and be in a more modern hotel.",Positive,,,,,
The breakfast was cold and expensive.  Not very good at all.,Positive,,,,,
"Honestly, why pay for parking if Iâ€™m paying to stay at the hotel too? Although it is not much to pay for it, still kind of odd. Never stayed at a hotel where you pay for parking",Positive,,,,,
"All was quite good until I needed to print boarding passes at the two hotel business computers/printers. They would not print and Miguel Olveralopez insisted that i could e-mail them to her for printing. When I said that i did not believe that was possible   because that possibility was not offered in the UAL software she said she could not help if I refused to take her ""suggestions"". I later found out from UAL that this cannot be done with their system.  I could text them to a number but that is not what she said and intended because she gave me ""miquel.olveralopez@hyatt.com"".Looks like equal training in software capability  and customer service is needed. No calls because I have had my fill of Hyatt for a few months.",Positive,,,,,
Notice of parking fees while booking would be helpful.,Negative,,,,,
Pool area ceiling vents had black surrounding it.  Dry sauna not functioning.  I believe you at one time had cocktail hour-what happened to that,Negative,,,,,
Samantha checked us in. She was very helpful and had a wonderful smile.,Positive,,,,,
We have stayed here for years. The friendliness and attentiveness of your front desk staff needs attention. They should be taught to acknowledge guests as they enter the hotel. It is very simple to look up and at the very least say hello. There were 4 people at the desk when I checked in and I waited to be acknowledged. Same thing every time we returned to hotel. No greeting at all. I would like to feel welcome in a place where I am laying my head at night.,Positive,,,,,
I requested a river view room but they gave us a room with no river view so I called the desk and they did then give us a river view room. But the gal at the desk said the person I talked to when reserving a room put it in the system as a request instead of booking a room with a river view and said next time I need to tell them I want a river view room. So my question is - why was I given such a hard time when I initially requested a river view room?,Negative,,,,,
Great service and the people working here are assets to the property. Very nice.,Positive,,,,,
"Two days in a row, housekeeping failed to stop by and clean. On the day that the room was cleaned, no toiletries were left, so I ran out.

The food was very poor and not worth the price.  The pulled pork sandwich was very dry and it was obviously just reheated.  The breakfast sandwich wasn't horrible, but the service was.  I was given a cup of watered down coffee and no refill was ever offered.  Once I received the food, there was no follow-up to see if anything else was needed.  I was wanting some salt and Tabasco sauce.  The waitress only returned when it was time for me to pay.",Positive,,,,,
Keep the good job,Positive,,,,,
"Was able to do early check in, staff was nice and polite.  Rooms were fairly priced. Cheaper then the other place l was going to book. Rooms were very nice and clean. The pool, hot tub, sauna, steam room and even a splash pad was such a success with the kids!",Positive,,,,,
Fix the Wi-Fi,Positive,,,,,
The wifi did not work very well and I wasnâ€™t interested in paying for the premium. Hotel was nice but not modern enough for me to return. Having to pay for parking was also not appreciated. I never have to pay at other Green Bay hotels and they were much nicer.,Positive,,,,,
"We made reservations for 5 people in the room. It seems that no matter where we stay, there are only towels and face cloths for 4....",Positive,,,,,
"Also, as someone with chronic pain who works in the entertainment industry, the hot tub closing at an early 11pm is very disheartening.",Negative,,,,,
Only negative was the elevator had garbage in it from the time we checked in til the time we checked out.,Negative,,,,,
"The pool and hot tub weâ€™re dirty (straws floating around), the sauna did not work but was advertised online, the staff was nice, the gym was nice, it took longer than expected to checkout with only one person in front of me",Negative,,,,,
Place is very nice. Beds are comfy and very clean.,Positive,,,,,
Noise control should be better addressed after midnight there was a fight or some very loud people that sounded like it was right in our room for over an hour. Very hard to sleep with people being disruptive so late for so long.,Positive,,,,,
"Need lighter weight covers, they are much too heavy and hot. Need night stand on both sides of each bed.",Positive,,,,,
We ate breakfast every day at the hotel.  The wait staff on all days were very good.  Seemed like a wait for the food to come out to the table was longer than usual.,Positive,,,,,
"Very friendly staff, clean room, great amenities",Positive,,,,,
Breakfast needs to open before 7 on weekends.,Positive,,,,,
The front desk woman laughed when I told her that my fiance and I froze. She kept interrupting me when I was speaking as well.,Positive,,,,,
The hot water wasnâ€™t working very well,Positive,,,,,
Great staff!!,Positive,,,,,
Clients should be a given a little more information on the bus routes etc as most of people were there for the Packers games and did use the public transport.,Positive,,,,,
Staff at checkin and cleaning service were extremely helpful and courteous.,Positive,,,,,
Door to bathroom needs to be replaced and floor tile was cracked.,Negative,,,,,
"Upon arriving I asked if we could not be on the top floor. I was told moving to another floor would be an upgrade. That seemed a little ridiculous as I was asking for a same type room on another floor. I was then told that because I had requested a room with a balcony when I registered online, I had to be on the top floor. The agent seemed to think I should have known only the top floor had balconies.  We will stay at the Hyatt in the future, but this just wasnâ€™t the usual polite reception we usually receive. It may have been a stressful day for the staff as the Packers were in town the night before.",Negative,,,,,
"everything in the room and hotel were great, the only thing is i noticed when time to go to bed, housekeeping put a regular sheet on the bed and just tucked it around the bed instead of it being a fitted sheet and then the regular sheet. other than that everything was great.",Positive,,,,,
I would have more checks on the hot tub. Constant unattended children and babies in there so unsafe.,Negative,,,,,
Excellent staff and hotel,Positive,,,,,
Didnâ€™t get much for the price. Would have preferred a continental breakfast rather than paying. Also no room service and had to pay for parking. Overall underwhelmed,Positive,,,,,
"The lady at the front desk, sorry I did not get her name, was very friendly, polite and helpful, she made our stay very pleacent.",Positive,,,,,
The room was warm and smelled a bit like smoke,Neutral,,,,,
"We arrived earlier than our check-in time (I opted for early check-in, but our room wasn't ready). The front desk offered us a different room that was already available, so we decided to take it. Thought maybe there would be a price difference between the rooms, so a little surprised it was the same. Our room could use a couple of minor repairs, but the overall experience was good.",Positive,,,,,
Thanks for being so awesome!,Positive,,,,,
The food in the bar was not up to par for a Hyatt Regency,Positive,,,,,
"Disappointed in overall stay. I had my brother in law check in first as my flight from Denver was delayed. I had recently convinced him to become a Hyatt member and to get the Chase Hyatt Credit Card, and he was disappointed in the overall loyalty program and treatment or lack thereof for extending my Globalist status.",Negative,,,,,
Please teach your breakfast people not leave coffe grounds in the coffe pot or customers cups!!,Positive,,,,,
Very helpful at the front desk,Positive,,,,,
Wondering why we have to pay for parking?,Positive,,,,,
"The hotel is nice. Check in process took way too long. Also, the park pass process was annoying. Staff was very nice. It just a pain to get in and out.",Negative,,,,,
During check out I was not provided a receipt of my stay. Did late checkout and was provided a receipt with no amount on it. She took long to give me a receipt and at the end it was wrong.,Negative,,,,,
Very enjoyable stay.,Positive,,,,,
"Front desk offered to validate my parking receipt, however following my stay I was billed $10 for parking.  This is unacceptable to me since the lot was for hotel guests and I expect parking to be free for guests.  I will not stay there again because of this!",Positive,,,,,
Very friendly and helpful,Positive,,,,,
Checked in early to get prepared for the Packer Game. Customer Service provided a space for us to be comfortable and relax while waiting for our room. Very helpful!,Positive,,,,,
"Housekeeping came only once in the morning prior to 9:30AM which was a bit early for us to be gone for the day.  We had asked for an afternoon service, but it only occurred once after the third night of our stay.
As a Courtesy Card member and with a small card given to us at check-in outlining our benefits, some of the items were not delivered.  We bought our water as we never had two bottles of water ever delivered.  We also never received the welcoming amenity, even on the second day after a late first day arrival.
The room we were given is nice, but I would recommend that a dresser or some type of drawers be placed in the room.  One small closet for hanging a few items is not enough room for two people for four nights of normal unpacking of items.
Thanks.",Positive,,,,,
best hotel & staff in green bay !!!,Positive,,,,,
"The bathroom was clean, toilet had issues flushing properly.",Positive,,,,,
Why were the toilets so low?   Others in my group were saying the same thing.,Neutral,,,,,
Seems time for an update to the bathrooms and to the carpet in some areas. But overall a very nice stay for the price.,Negative,,,,,
Very courteous and thorough staff.,Positive,,,,,
Very nice hotel for the price.,Positive,,,,,
Why validate parking when I still got charged for it when I stayed at your hotel.,Positive,,,,,
The parking entrance is confusing.  I drove around the block trying to figure out how to get in.,Negative,,,,,
Heater didn't work in room,Negative,,,,,
"Stayed there to attend concert, upon our return we went to the bar to unwind .  We sat down and were told last call at 10:45. Disappointing",Negative,,,,,
We have an unautorized charge on our bill.  I have been trying to contact Hyattt for 4 days and have no call back yet.,Positive,,,,,
I think the additional parking fee is not necessary.,Negative,,,,,
The bar closed at 11 pm. There were 13 people in the bar!  8 would have stayed for sure.,Neutral,,,,,
Love the interior space.,Positive,,,,,
During our check in process I had asked for a different room and the lady at the front desk ask why and would not proceed. I finally had to state that I am the customer and I asked for a different location. I do not see how it was her business to continue to ask why I wanted a different location.,Positive,,,,,
Great Place.,Positive,,,,,
"Staff just didnâ€™t seem interested in providing any kind of general service or even engaging with guests. Besides the guy who checked us in, but nearly all other staff seemed like they couldnâ€™t be bothered or even offer a general smile or hello.",Positive,,,,,
Girl that checked us in was rude.,Negative,,,,,
This stay was pretty good this time.,Positive,,,,,
Rooms seem to be ready for an update and better lighting,Positive,,,,,
We were there for a company appreciation dinner.  I felt the curtains in my room were starting to show wear.  We have stayed here previously.  We also found that we needed to pay for parking which was a first.,Positive,,,,,
Wish you had a complimentary breakfast.,Positive,,,,,
Once you make a reservation. Your confirmed price should not fluctuate based on how busy the hotel is. Seemed like price gouging. We've never had this problem.,Positive,,,,,
"Missed breakfast - did not realize closed at 10:30.  The girl at the front desk was kind, pleasant and very helpful.",Positive,,,,,
"hotel bar and lounge was very under staffed, bar  area was very full with one bar tender",Positive,,,,,
Check-in staff was uninformed and manager on duty was rude and had absolutely no desire to help out in situation to come to a better remedy,Positive,,,,,
Wonderful experience with all experiences of my stay and clinic.,Positive,,,,,
"For cost of room, no complementary coffee at lobby and charging for breakfast was not expected.",Positive,,,,,
You should take the name Hyatt off the hotel  So you can protect the name Hyatt Will not ever stay at any Hyatt again,Positive,,,,,
"Overall, we were not happy with our accommodations at Hyatt Green Bay. We paid $183 for a king room for one night and were not happy with the extra fees described to us at check-in (ex: $10 parking and non-complimentary breakfast ($18 a plate)). For how much we paid for one room for one night of stay we were very disappointed. Please consider describing all fees prior to or during booking.",Positive,,,,,
"Very disappointed in the $10 Parking Fee.  1)It's Green Bay, WI charging for parking is ridiculous.  2) Just build it into you rates for full disclosure.",Negative,,,,,
"The young lady that checked me was fantastic. Very friendly, helpful, and professional.  Treated me like a rockstar.  She was also great with the passenger behind me who was being kind of a jerk. She should be recognized for the great job she does.  Thanks mike",Positive,,,,,
Gym Equipment is in need of upgrades. Some equipment not working properly,Positive,,,,,
"A little refresher to the rooms would go a long way, like a fresh coat of paint.",Positive,,,,,
"My husband could not check us in without me even though he showed hos drivers license. 
There was a very loud humming noise in the room.",Positive,,,,,
James was as awesome as ever! He remembered us from February!  Winnie was very helpful as well. Fantastic experience.  We love it at the Hyatt in Green Bay!,Positive,,,,,
James Pritchett was great!,Positive,,,,,
"Overall, the room and hotel were very nice and clean.  Carpet needs stretching.  There was a big loose spot that could be a tripping hazard.  Hot water was really hot.  I think it was dangerous for children.
I don't know if you do the food for the conference center or not so this may not apply.  Some of the food was cold or barely warm.",Positive,,,,,
Lady at front desk was very unaccomodating.  I also could hardly hear her with her mask on.,Neutral,,,,,
Old hotel elevator was a snail and to charge me $10 extra per night for a king bed and we had 60 rooms at hotel unexceptable and will never stay there again,Positive,,,,,
Staff could start speaking a little louder,Negative,,,,,
Rm 416 . The commode is unlevel which causes the stool to rock and will eventually cause a break you your seal. You will want to see to this. Conference rooms were too cold. Hybrid meeting audio and video needs ALOT of work. I expect you all will get this perfected soon.,Positive,,,,,
Tax exempt form was difficult for staff to understand for some reason.,Negative,,,,,
"Just want to point out. The beds were not really made, their was no fitted sheet and nothing was tucked in, kind of sloppy. Also there was a hair tie under the covers when I pulled the bed down. I didn't complain because I didn't feel like moving rooms or causing an issue. But I would think you would agree that this level of detail should not be overlooked.",Positive,,,,,
"Nice hotel, great customer service by everyone except one front desk person, also the WOH chat help people are great",Positive,,,,,
"James (front desk manager) needs to go!  Love the property, but the guy is so difficult to work with and INCOMPETENT!!

He couldnâ€™t even add a simple name to a reservation to make an easy check-in after the strictest verification process ever (which Iâ€™m fine with), but WTH manâ€¦. You put me through all that and you DONT add the name!!!",Positive,,,,,
The food provided by the hotel for the conference was not very good and it was difficult to get allergy safe meals.,Positive,,,,,
The hotel staff were very understanding about late parking.,Positive,,,,,
"Zero capex investment into this dated property; mold, rotted carpet, itâ€™s in terrible condition",Negative,,,,,
"I stayed in room 717 and forgot to tell the desk staff that the door was not alway shutting all the way if we weren't careful to make sure it closed. I came back to the room after staff had been in to take care of towels and they had also left it open a bit so the it wasn't locked. I did it once or twice myself, too. Otherwise, my room was very comfortable and I really like the layout.",Positive,,,,,
"The only complaint I have is navigating around the hotel.  Signage to convention center (E vs W side) was a little confusing.  The elevators were unusually slow.  And while I'm generally happy to take a stairwell (I like the exercise), the ones I tried didn't connect to the ground floor as they should have but instead led only to a one-way exit to the street.",Positive,,,,,
"Breakfast. Couldnâ€™t tell if it was open the area was so dark. Waitress to busy stocking something behind a cabinet or talking with host  I had to ask for coffee refill and I was the only one there  coffee was t that good anyway   The pancakes tasted like they were made from old batter carried over from another day.  
In the room, I donâ€™t understand powdered coffee creamer. Almost a sin. Everything else was actually quite perfect",Positive,,,,,
"Everybody was great except girl in Starbucks cafe on Wednesday 10/26/22, not friendly at all. We had to leave before 7 am, and front desk guy told us to have them make us a sandwich, young lady on Tuesday and Thursday Morning was exceptional, smiling, and super accommodating, she took great care of us.",Positive,,,,,
"too expensive, had to pay to park.",Negative,,,,,
Towel racks needed in bathroom.  Front desk staff very helpful.,Positive,,,,,
My only issue was the power outlets. They should be updated for the convenience of modern technology.,Positive,,,,,
"The refrigerator was loud so I turned it way down (to one of two setting that said ""off"", oddly, though it didn't turn off) so I wouldn't have to listen to it. The overly brown decor could use some updating but it was comfortable. I also had no idea how to operate the thermostat, but I was comfy so it didn't matter.",Negative,,,,,
Everyone was so incredibly nice during our stay. Exceeded our expectations in level of customer service. Would definitely stay again and recommend to others.,Positive,,,,,
The staff was wonderful to work with. Rooms were nicer than expected and it was much quieter than other places I have stayed recently. I was surprised that rooms were cleaned daily. Great experience!,Positive,,,,,
"During my stay everything was wonderful. Upon returning home, I realized Hyatt billed my personal credit card, instead of my business, that was swiped for incidentals when I arrived. I called twice and left 2 messages regarding the mixup and never received a call back. My personal credit card was credited but I would have appreciated a personal call back to inform me. I do not feel that is good business to not speak with me.",Positive,,,,,
I can hear the noise from the rooms around me,Neutral,,,,,
I got defrauded by the hotel staff. I'm going to present a legal demand shortly.,Neutral,,,,,
Did not like the parking system. Had to pay extra and go through gates. When we check out the gate was not working.,Positive,,,,,
"They sent security to my room because they thought my girlfriend, who I have been with for 3 years and have been their several times. Sent a security guard to check her I.d",Negative,,,,,
Everything is great except the elevators are way too slow and the sleeper sofas in the rooms need to be replaced badly. They are kind of gross.,Negative,,,,,
The room was much too dim. Additional lighting options would be welcome.,Positive,,,,,
I would love it if you had smart tvs so I could login to my apps. Room service would be great aswell.,Positive,,,,,
Outlet in bathroom did not work.,Positive,,,,,
Very nice accomodations. Great place for a conference.,Positive,,,,,
"The MOD at least I think she was, was so helpful and kind. She worked on the night of 10/18 and morning of 10/19",Positive,,,,,
"Credit card was overchargedâ€”although front desk corrected the bill, credit card was charged incorrect amount. Reached Hyatt billing department, long waiting on phone. Also sent email-no response. Did not receive Hyatt points for my stay",Negative,,,,,
"Hyatt employees were very friendly, helpful, and always near when I had a question.",Positive,,,,,
"I checked in ahead of time, yet a very grouchy desk clerk refused to give me a room key because ""it is not your room"". I had to show a picture of myself on a website before I was granted access to my room. It was ridiculous and the woman was curt and rude.",Negative,,,,,
"My second night there I had left my room key in my car by accident.  It was 3am and I parked in the very last row.  I went to the front desk to see if the girl could print me a new room key so I didn't have to walk back out to the parking lot and get my key.  She said she could not as she just reset her system.  So I had to walk back out to the last row to get my room key.  Also, during our stay my son developed pink eye and gave it to my daughter.  We brought the kids to the doctor on Monday morning and our doctor is certain that they received pink eye from playing in your pool.",Positive,,,,,
I stayed there in early September and the sauna was broken. I stayed there in middle October and sauna still broken. Very few parking spots available this last trip.,Positive,,,,,
Great stay!,Positive,,,,,
Everyone from housekeeping to front desk were very friendly,Positive,,,,,
"We loved our room but it seemed it was a bit dusty. I know itâ€™s hard for housekeeping to thoroughly clean things but maybe having someone going around to vacuum along the walls and in corners is in order. Other than that, it was a really great experience and we will definitely stay again!!",Positive,,,,,
"My wife and I attempted to go to bed at approximately 11pm. 
There was apparently some sort of convention going on in the hotel that we were not a part of. 
There were many people congregated in the atrium, making alot of noise. 
At approximately 11:30pm I attempted to use the telephone in the room to contact the front desk to complain about the noise, and discovered that the phone did not work. 
I then used my cell phone to call the desk to complain. 
The female attendant that answered my call confirmed that there were people congregated in the atrium and stated that she would alert Security to take care of the problem. 
I then advised her that the room phone was not working, and I immediately received a very condescending apology in what I perceived to be a very annoyed tone of voice. I immediately responded with an equally annoyed response telling her that I didn't want an apology, just to take care of the original noise complaint. 
Eventually, sometime shortly after midnight the noise stopped.",Positive,,,,,
Front desk staff awesome!,Positive,,,,,
"I went on the website for Green Bay Hyatt to make my reservation and found out after I had made it that it had been made through Booking.com.  I donâ€™t like using an outside party to make. A hotel reservation.  If I canâ€™t make it directly with the hotel, I wonâ€™t stay at that property again.",Positive,,,,,
"The stay was so loud. Music blaring from 6:30 am on. So much loud banging, doors slamming, loud screaming till at least 1am. Such a bad nights sleep both nights, especially with kids. My poor son kept waking up scared from the noise. I will never stay there again.",Negative,,,,,
"After I was checked in, my room was then also assigned to someone else.  Thankfully I knew the person and they came and told me about it and that they were in my room while I was not there.  
It would be nice if the elevators went a little faster.",Positive,,,,,
"See previous comment, this place sucks!",Positive,,,,,
"Jolee Jackson, Assistant Front Office Manager, was fantastic and made the stay at our National Rural conference a time to remember!  Jolee gest an A +!",Positive,,,,,
The corner room we were in could definitely use an upgrade. The carpet was buckling. Definitely need more lighting in the room and drawers.,Positive,,,,,
Always a pleasure to work with the Hyatt Staff and Mike Jubert and Tracy Hillesheim,Positive,,,,,
All the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The house keeping staff was particularly impressive.,Positive,,,,,
"We won't return until we know the heat works properly in the room. We have always had issues getting room warm enough for what we prefer, but normally not cold air blowing out.",Positive,,,,,
Furniture in room was worn & old. Needs updates,Negative,,,,,
"Bathrooms small and could use an update, but it was clean and acceptable.",Positive,,,,,
Great staff and good experience,Positive,,,,,
Cassiana always does a nice job.  The staff at the counter were amazing!!,Positive,,,,,

The transition from the hall to the bathroom flooring had a sharp object that snagged my $20 socks and poked my foot.  Room 211,Negative,,,,,
"Very disappointed with the breakfast buffet. As someone with food allergies, it was challenging to find safe options. Would be nice if in an allergy situation, a customer could still order off the usual menu.",Positive,,,,,
We had a wonderful experience at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. We arrive a little early because I am a World of Hyatt member. Someone brought us a box fan because it was a little too warm in the room. My kids loved the breakfast buffet. The fitness center was awesome and clean. We took the shuttle to the game Sunday. Just really enjoyed our trip - thank you!,Positive,,,,,
Front Desk Personnel were great with assistance and answering all questions. Very Professional. Room was clean and everything worked flawlessly. Breakfast Buffet was better than anticipated and overall the Entire Stay was Great!,Positive,,,,,
"Great , friendly and accommodating staff! We had a fun time at the bar watching sports.",Positive,,,,,
Bed was very uncomfortable. Air was extremely dry both nights.,Negative,,,,,
I was disappointed that the restaurant was closed so early but know staffing is hard to fill.,Negative,,,,,

One of the friendliest hotel staffs around!,Neutral,,,,,
"While the room was comfortable, it was difficult to turn up the heat when needed.  Didn't see much happen when we turned up thermostat.",Neutral,,,,,
staff were very friendly and helpful.,Positive,,,,,
"The beds were comfortable, but the bathroom was horrible. For nearly $500/night, one might be able to ask for a bottle of water and expect the answer not to be ""you have to buy it over there"".  I've stayed at far less expensive, but nicer hotels where the bottle of water is complimentary.  I think you could have provided that as a courtesy.  Really put me off of your brand.",Positive,,,,,
Too expensive,Neutral,,,,,
"We enjoyed our stay very much, the staff was very helpful and respectful.",Positive,,,,,
"Everything was great,  except too pricey...",Positive,,,,,
"This centrally located destination hotel needs refreshing. It is right out of 1986 with hollow core bathroom doors, tiny toilets, wrought iron detailing, leaky windows, and tired fixtures. There is no binder of information about the hotel or local activities. The view out our window was an unadorned, undecorated brick wall. We were in the Hyatt for a wedding party but usually book next door (a Hilton property) where the atmosphere is brighter, fresher and includes breakfast. It is entirely possible to brighten this space (even the brick wall view) with paint and plants, and the in-room information would be easily updated. Bed and bath fixtures could be replaced, making this a hotel worthy of a wedding night, a football game (at $400/night!) or for any other visit to Green Bay. In the 80s, a stay in a Hyatt meant class and style. Itâ€™s time for this hotel to tap into that energy again. Please.",Positive,,,,,
"For the price that we paid, we expected more. We understood it was a home packer game, but breakfast was not included. For the price we paid we expected to have a better experience.",Positive,,,,,
great breakfast servers; very nice.,Positive,,,,,
"The front desk staff was very professional! They were cheerful and accommodating on the phone, at check in and check out!",Positive,,,,,
Great Pub with great food!!,Positive,,,,,
"Breakfast was good, but a little slow",Positive,,,,,
I contacted the hotel and asked about a left behind phone charger.  I was told they would check with housekeeping and get back to me right away.  Never heard back.,Negative,,,,,
Food was expensive.,Positive,,,,,
Your breakfast was very slow and the service was very bad.  My first morning there I couldn't get anyone's attention to even get seated so I walked away.  The second morning I got seated fast enough but the server was very slow to get to my table.  I ordered and I had to chase down the waitress to get the cup of coffee I ordered.  I had been waiting 20 minutes for my food and I finally got my coffee.  I told the waitress if I didn't get my food soon I would like to cancel my order because I had to be in a meeting in 15 minutes.  She said she would check to see where it was and brought it out about 3 minutes later.  The eggs were cold.  I had to hurry to eat it to make it to the meeting.  I will skip breakfast the next time.,Positive,,,,,
"Conference room unbearably cold and no response to requests to change temperature 
Parking inadequate number of spots",Negative,,,,,
Breakfast service too slow.  Food served cold.,Positive,,,,,
I forgot to mention when I checked out of room 716 that the sliding glass door leaked when it rained. Noticed the carpet was wet. Very pleasant stay!,Positive,,,,,
Parking is an issue. I'm sure you've heard that before.  Inability to adjust room temperature (though I borrowed a heater) is a problem.  And the room didn't smell terribly fresh. Staff was friendly.,Negative,,,,,
"Very comfortable beds, friendly staff, clean room.",Positive,,,,,
"Comfortable bed - I like the mattress topper.  Pool area was nice, including steam room and jacuzzi.",Positive,,,,,
Miguel was very friendly and helpful,Positive,,,,,
"Room appeared grungy, old, not updated",Neutral,,,,,
Parking is a problem on busy times.  A sign posted in the lobby saying additional parking in the lot next door would help for the guests.,Negative,,,,,
"Everything in the room is good; the breakfast is a disaster. We waited for more than 30 minutes for the food, wasting lots of time.",Negative,,,,,
"Whilst we understand that the Hyatt is a family hotel, the level of noise on the 7th floor on Saturday night was bordering on unacceptable. There were kids running around with some sort of nerf guns, back and forth from one side of the floor to the other. The bathrooms are a little dated in the rooms, but nothing that would alter my decision to book there again. I have to disagree with the parking fee, as if I am paying to park, a secure, guarded setting would be more expected.  All of that being said, we do like the hotel a lot, and will stay there again in the future.  Staff at the front desk was outstandingly friendly and efficient. We requested a high floor and view of the parking lot which we received, and our room was spacious and quiet after Saturday night. The food in the restaurant was adequate at best, and the service was very slow, we probably would not eat at the restaurant again.",Positive,,,,,
"Having a right temperature with in the room is essential for rest, recovery and  sound sleep. With out that hardly anything matters.",Positive,,,,,
"I did not do express check out.  Would it be possible to get an email with a copy of the bill for my stay.
Thanks!",Positive,,,,,
Keep up the great work that you are doing.,Positive,,,,,
There was no Kleenex in my room.,Neutral,,,,,
James your Manager was extremely professional and accommodating to all our needs.,Positive,,,,,
Best place i ever stayed in.,Positive,,,,,
Excellent,Positive,,,,,
The fake scrambled eggs are terrible. Ham was sandwich meat in warm water. Used to be free if you stay there. $13.99 for that is a rip off. Days Inn has a better breakfast.,Positive,,,,,
"The only problem I experienced was coming back to the hotel tired at 10:30pm & not being able to park my SUV in your parking lot due to it being full.  I rode around for 15 min before I went in and the front desk girl told me I could park around the corner at no charge on weekends at the parking ramp or across the street in an open lot.  I would have liked to have been told that earlier at check-in as I am a woman traveling alone & was concerned over my safety & my vehicleâ€™s safety outside of your lot.  It worked out & I parked in the parking ramp around the corner and the next day at check-out the front desk girl credited back the parking fee charged for your lot.  Otherwise, my stay was very nice & my room was clean, quiet & comfortable.",Positive,,,,,
"The questioner is made sach a way that it doesnâ€™t reflect the whole service there
- l had to pay for parking. At Hyatt? Why?
- there is nothing complimentary, parking, coffee, breakfast, bottled water 
- the room l stayed was dated, the furniture, the toilet, the exterior sliding glass door.
- the personnel was very nice.",Positive,,,,,
Check in went smoothly. Hostess checking us in was great!,Positive,,,,,
Couldn't get breakfast...got there 2 minutes before they were taking orders...was told bar opened at 11 for lunch.... didn't open until 12...had to go elsewhere,Positive,,,,,
"I've stayed here a dozen times or so. It is the first hotel I look for for lodging. Great location, the rooms fit my needs, and the staff has always been courteous and helpful. This is my favorite place to stay in green bay!",Positive,,,,,
The Pub 333 food was excellent as was the bartender who served us during the afternoon of 10/08. I wish I remembered her name as she was extremely friendly and helpful.,Positive,,,,,
Great Staff at the front desk.,Positive,,,,,
"Staff was pleasant and helpful. Checkin checkout process was a breeze. Room is spacious however , it can maintained better . I saw bedbug crawling on the sheets. The curtainâ€™s seems to be dirty as well.",Positive,,,,,
"- Our doors were extremely loud. As you opened and closed them they made a very loud creaking sound.
- I slept in the sofa bed and unfortunately you could hear everything out in the lobby. It was 2 AM and I could hear someone dragging their feet for over 10 minutes. I could not get a good nights sleep! 
-Rooms were very accommodating to pets.",Negative,,,,,
clean and comfortable,Positive,,,,,
"I had the pleasure of dealing with Winnie behind the reception desk, her outgoing jovial personality was a breath of fresh air when dealing with hotel check in. She explained everything in detail and was always saying a friendly hello when passing by the desk. She is an asset to your organization and should be recognized as such.",Positive,,,,,
"Great stay, love this place",Positive,,,,,
"We were only able to book 2 queen beds through the app but when we arrived for check in they were able to give us a king bed, which we prefer and appreciated.",Positive,,,,,
I did not receive the discount coupons I was supposed to receive for breakfast at check in.,Positive,,,,,
"We only had the room for a short period of time as we checked in at 10pm and had to leave by 6:30 the next morning. By about 11:30pm the loud screeching coming from the vent in our room was so loud we ended up calling the front desk. At first they offered to send someone up to take a look, but because it was so late all we wanted was to get some sleep so we asked if we could just get a new room. We then had to bring all our stuff down to the lobby to ask for a new room, which we got. The only thing that was offered to accommodate this inconvenience was a credit for a coffee in the morningâ€¦ $150 for 6 hours of sleep and having to switch rooms was definitely not worth it.",Negative,,,,,
"Had a wonderful stay, would stay there again. Nice hotel and friendly staff",Positive,,,,,
"This is the first hotel I had to pay for coffee in the morning.   On top of that, coffee wasn't available in the morning.   Not good when you are up early to get going.",Positive,,,,,
"Room dated, worn, bath wall mold, tile chipped. Staff was excellent, excellent bedding. No room service, evening dining limited, not all menu offering available. Will not use again.",Positive,,,,,
"Breakfast was terrible, furnishings were old, check in was slow, elevators are extremely slow, parking sucks!",Negative,,,,,
"Obvious humidity issues in bathrooms.  Clean but this may be something to keep an eye on. Lots of cords plugged in one outlet near the table between the beds.  Again, this did not greatly impact my staff but worth reviewing the ability to correct or improve upon.",Positive,,,,,
"Please make sure your Front staff is aware of Breakfast prices. When asked, they said they dont know. You dont want customers to have doubts if they dont know how much breakfast cost.",Positive,,,,,
I rated breakfast low because I usually stay at hotels that offer free breakfast.,Positive,,,,,
breakfast for a large number of conference attendees was slow.  there were not enough tables for everyone and made us late for conference sessions.,Negative,,,,,
Thank you for the upgrade and for maintaining the hotel well.,Positive,,,,,
An upgrade to the elevators is desperately needed. They are terribly slow.,Negative,,,,,
"Air Conditioner din't work and despite two requests no one came. Thanks fully, not too hot but room was a little too warm",Positive,,,,,
we moved rooms 3 times,Negative,,,,,
$25 fee to checkin when my room was available is insane. Bar staff was terrible.,Negative,,,,,
"Everything was great! Only thing I would have changed was the - Breakfast was extremely disappointing. We arrived at 9:40, 20 minutes before they stop serving/ close. Yogurt was out, eggs were hard and cold, bread was hard from sitting out all morning. A server came over and asked how our breakfast was. I am not one to speak up when Iâ€™m unhappy, so I said â€œgood thank youâ€. Her response was â€œgood Iâ€™m glad since you came as we are closingâ€. Was a bit snarky like she didnâ€™t want us there and was trying to rush us out. Would not recommend the breakfast at ALL. 

Other than that the stay was wonderful and the front desk staff was AMAZING!",Positive,,,,,
Very nice service. Very polite,Positive,,,,,
"The issue with paying for parking was not clearly presented when making the reservation or upon checkin.   I had to inquire after we could not leave the lot, because we had not paid for the parking.  That should have been explained during the reservation or at checkin",Positive,,,,,
New pillows are recommended,Positive,,,,,
Paying to park outside in a parking lot is an odd concept. Breakfast was marginal at best.,Positive,,,,,
I hoped it would be easier to connect to Netflix.,Positive,,,,,
Kristine was extremely helpful and helped ensure our experience was beyond expectations. That is what 30 years of management experience within Hyatt gets you - priceless.,Positive,,,,,
The morning we left couldnâ€™t find any coffee in the lobby without paying for it and taking too much time. Was disappointed,Negative,,,,,
"Overall, a good experience. However, bathroom was small and inability to adjust A/C was annoying.",Negative,,,,,
"Stayed for a Packer game, no dedicated check-in line for Globalist but they had plenty of people working and the line moved quickly.",Positive,,,,,
Parking was a headache,Negative,,,,,
I had soup (french onion) in the restaurant that was terrible.  Parking lot was full- there was no signage at the desk that explained what to do (had to wait for someone to talk to us). I have an error on my bill that I received electronically.  So far not easy to reach someone to address the problem but it is unfortunate that I have to use more of my time to get it fixed.,Negative,,,,,
"The room overall was clean but there were flower petals on the counter which leads me to believe the room was not thoroughly cleaned prior to  my stay. Also, the carpet needed attention as it's buckling.",Positive,,,,,
James at the front desk was delightful and very informative. He answered any and all questions we had as well as explained the Hyatt Rewards program which I signed up for.,Positive,,,,,
Lack of room service is disappointing.  Kitchen shut down at 9:00 pm is inconvenient ( would have ordered appetizers for later on in the bar if we could have).  Bar was staffed with only 2  bartenders ( one of whom was very crabby) and shut down my midnight ( last call announced at 11:00).  This is a missed revenue opportunity for the Hyatt- the bar was packed on both Wednesday and Thursday night with Leading Age WI attendees who were ready and willing to stay and spend money.  It is very unfortunate that socialization and networking opportunities were cut short.,Negative,,,,,
I was sent an email that my room was ready early. I was there for a conference and not allowed to check in early unless I signed up for rewards which I did but still couldn't check in until 1:00.,Positive,,,,,
Great room! Loved it,Positive,,,,,
Allow for heat to be adjusted.,Negative,,,,,
â€œManagerâ€ was not helpful with checking in. Others were allowed to check in early if they did not have her. â€œManagerâ€ was also not helpful when there was a line of 40 people waiting to get into breakfast. I approached her to help things get moving quicker since we had a conference. She said she would â€œsee what she could doâ€. She did nothing. Iâ€™ve been coming to this hotel for about 15 years on an annual basis. This was the worst Iâ€™ve experienced.,Positive,,,,,
"Due to COVID and germs we needed to shower before bed.  I feel this is unexplainable due to the rates we paid for the rooms. We also had 3 rooms. So for 2 nights we paid over $1,800. Frustrating that the first night when we called the front desk to ask about the freezing water, we were told. We will let maintenance know, but unfortunately they wonâ€™t be here till the morning. The second night when we called the front desk to ask about the freezing water, we were told: yea they have been having that problem all week, hopefully it should be back on in the morning and if not maintenance will be here. I feel that this itâ€™s some thing that could have been communicated with all guests upon arrival and check-in, since itâ€™s been an issue all week.",Negative,,,,,
"Even tho we pre checked in, had everything faxed ahead of time, still waited 1/2 hour to get checked in, saying our corporate credit card was not valid, had to put on another credit card.",Positive,,,,,
Staff was great.,Positive,,,,,
Charged me for no show which was not the case.  Your website also does not allow to adjust the reservation,Positive,,,,,
James was great at check-in. Service at breakfast was very good. Room was fresh and clean.,Positive,,,,,
"Was told breakfast was free, ended up having to pay. Also had to pay for parking which should of been free. Hotel very nice overall but disappointed about having to pay extra for all these things.",Positive,,,,,
The pool and exercise room were nice than expected and had great amenities,Positive,,,,,
Breakfast for the conference was chaos. Staff not prepared for numbers of people. Tables not cleared so I sat at table with dirty plates. Ran out of silverware and coffee: had to ask for it.,Positive,,,,,
I did not like the parkingâ€¦.the gate and having to pay each time we came in/out was awful,Negative,,,,,
Very patient and helpful.,Positive,,,,,
The hideabed should have 2 sheets.   We only have 1 sheet.,Negative,,,,,
"Your evening manager, James was very helpful...not so much anyone else",Negative,,,,,
Every aspect of my stay was wonderful.,Positive,,,,,
There was also a broken tile in the bathroom that was loose and moved when stepped on. The hotel is just very old and outdated. I would have expected it to be a bit nicer given the area and thatâ€™s it was attached to the convention center.,Negative,,,,,
We had an issue regarding accident with hot coffee and cups that were provided at the hotel. Hotel has info. On file.,Negative,,,,,
"Girl at front desk was rude after I told her the price of an item I was paying for.  She acted like she didnâ€™t believe me and made me feel like a criminal.  I was right, by the way.  
Cleaning crew never left shampoo and conditioner in my room.  I had to ask for it every day.  They were in my room each day putting out clean towels but never would leave hair products.  
I wonâ€™t be staying there again.",Positive,,,,,
I love it here. I only stay at the Hyatt when working in green bay,Positive,,,,,
"Could not adjust the temp in the room and it was cold.
Also cant believe you charge $16 for breakfast for staying guests the Hampton offers free breakfast so we will stay their next time. The older style of this hotel had green trees in the central court and a fountain now its so plain.",Positive,,,,,
"The Hotel is beautifully laid out, all the rooms are on the outside walls
We were on the second floor our room faced main st, which is very busy and produced a lot of traffic noise.
We were also very close to the elevator, which created a loud buzzing sound when it went up and down, very annoying.. especially at night. I did mention this to the staff when we checked out.",Positive,,,,,
We had a wedding there and after it ended several guests wanted to go to the bar but were told it was closed at 11:30,Neutral,,,,,
"Room was quite nice until we opened the curtain to see a sold brick wall about 10 feet away and a roof below us littered with cigarette butts and a liquor bottle.  Worse part was we were told the buffet was complimentary only to receive a bill for $40 which was conveniently added to our bill, unedible powdered eggs and  no coffee, as they were ""out.""  @ members of the staff pretty musched stared at us while we were there, quite uncomfortable.  Must be better options in Green Bay especially for the price.  Other members of our group reported similar experiences at the breakfast, especially the glaring of staff.",Positive,,,,,
Staff were wonderful...always  welcoming you with a smile and on top of day to day functions,Positive,,,,,
The two women I talked to when I booked our room on the phone were not very good :( They were not at the Hyatt in Green Bay.,Positive,,,,,
Hotel is lovely. I was in Room 323 there was a wrinkle in the carpet that could be tripping hazard. I loved the Market so food items could be purchased at any time day or night.,Positive,,,,,
The facility rooms are dated but comfortable.  And the staff was very helpful,Positive,,,,,
"Having ONE person to make special coffee drinks, breakfast sandwiches, and be the cashier when you have a convention going on is probably not the greatest. Lots of people left the line because of the long wait and our classes were starting soon.",Positive,,,,,
Breakfast was kinda cold,Positive,,,,,
"The hotel is very â€œdatedâ€. It looks like the decor is 30 years old. Hallways are poorly lit and the rooms have poor lighting, as well.",Positive,,,,,
Lobby is beautiful. Rooms are good. The Marketplace needs some work.,Positive,,,,,
Everyone was so friendly and helpful. The only thing I would say is my sprinkler head in my sitting room had no cover on it. It was open with no ring around it. Room 528,Positive,,,,,
Our stay was very nice. The only negative feedback we have is the additional $10 to park at the hotel parking lot. I can understand if the hotel was located in a large city with limited parking but that isnâ€™t the case here. Over the last several years the cost has gone up with less included. The parking used to be free along with a free breakfast. There also used to be a complimentary social hour in the evening which has also gone away.,Positive,,,,,
"Limited parking available and not being from the area, finding the additional parking was a bit difficult",Negative,,,,,
"The check in process for one of my staff members attending a conference was absolutely horrible!  We sent over ALL the necessary paperwork weeks in advance, front desk staff said they didn't have it, so while we were out of state at our own conference we had to send it three more times.  I will never recommend the Hyatt Regency Green Bay to any business colleague based on that unprofessional experience.",Negative,,,,,
"The lovely person at reception around 5:30pm on 9/22 was absolutely the most friendly and phenomenal person. Unfortunately, I didn't catch their name as I had just come in from a 6-hour drive, but I do want to give them glowing recognition.",Positive,,,,,
"Overall we were very happy to stay here. The check in  was very very nice, the young lady was helpful & presented.

About 5.00/6.00 pm we came back from dinner and asked for tissue ( the lady & not young), we have not get it until 10 pm. I should to ask her name.

Only one person that we were not happy .",Positive,,,,,
"Our stay was in order to attend a concert at a local venue. The website states the hotel would coordinate either shuttle or taxi services for local events, but when we asked to have a shuttle or taxi arranged for transportation the staff notified us that the shuttle only runs for Packers games and could not call a taxi. Since we do not use the Uber or Lyft apps, we would have to call another local taxi which they provided us the contact info for. The desk services were beyond helpful with accommodating our needs and everything was arranged in time, although we were anticipating not having to call local businesses that we were not familiar with and having the hotel handle the arrangements like stated on the website.",Positive,,,,,
Put the hair driers in the bathrooms.  I didn't find mine.,Neutral,,,,,
The parking was confusing - not clear that as an overnight guest you needed a ticket to enter and had to pay a fee. We drive around the block 3 times and then went to the city lot - signage would have been helpful.,Positive,,,,,
"One of the elevator doors closed on my cousins hand, who was visiting me while I was staying at the hotel. They gave antibiotics and bandaid to help",Positive,,,,,
I thought the  Hyatt was an upscale hotel.but our room was right next to the highway so loud noises all night. The bathroom toilet was small and low to the ground ( good for kids not older people) not impressed with the shower spray. We did find the beds very comfortable. Was not made awear the we had to pay for parking every day we were there.sorry but we would not recommend your hotel.,Positive,,,,,
"Only had 1 bartender on on a Friday Night, while a concert was in town and Green Bay Packer Alumni were staying at the hotel. Waited too long to never be served, that was our only disappointment.",Negative,,,,,
Toilets are way too short.  Maintenance man coming out of the pool area was rude,Positive,,,,,
An email was sent regarding a negative situation we experienced.,Negative,,,,,
"I rented 2 rooms and had it catered thru the Hyatt. Everything was great. I spoke to Michael Jubert and he said I didnt use the min on the food and the room. The bill was 45.00 per person and serving was for 35 people =1575.00 + 2 rooms at 200.00 apiece =1975. He told me it would be around 2400.00 and 600.00 or 700.00 credit will have to be used towards another stay. Im still womdering how the bill is 3,244.13.",Positive,,,,,
Had to call twice to request a roll away bed. Was also disappointed that as a rewards customer I had to pay full price for parking. When a discount was provided for brand new rewards customers,Positive,,,,,
"Feather free room has been part of my profile since I started staying at Hyatt.  Been a globalist for about 7-8 years now and a top 50 Hyatt Rewards member but lately doesn't seem to mean much to Hyatt.  Only the Hyatt Regency Chicago and Hyatt Place Knoxville value my loyalty.  Hyatt Regency Green Bay ignored the details of my reservation for feather free room even though they acknowledged it was on my reservation.  I had just stayed there 2 weeks prior and went thru feather free then.  After arriving Fri evening and checking in, we dropped our bags in the room. I checked the hair dryer because stay 2 weeks prior the hair dryer didn't even work, this one was so disgustingly dirty with stains and filled with hair I needed gloves to pick it up and take to front desk.  Front desk staff even stepped back when I showed them the hair dryer!  We then went downstairs to the Hyatt Pub 313 restaurant for dinner/drinks. Pub staff was great.  When got back to the room that evening and getting ready for bed was when we discovered that the room was not feather free and my wife almost sliced her finger open on broken glass soap dish so I went back down to front desk again.  Room service finally arrived with foam pillows and he started to walk right into our room, no knock on door!!!!  He brought pillows and pillow cases, one pillow case had stains on it.  Did not bring a blanket to replace the feather comforter on bed.  I found an extra blanket in closet and put it on bed.  Blanket also had stains on it.  Having to remake a bed myself at 11:00 pm is not what I expect to be doing at any hotel let alone a Hyatt Regency where I'm a Globalist.  I'm beginning to question why I should stay so dedicated to Hyatt.  Globalist status and loyalty seems to be fading across the Hyatt brand.",Negative,,,,,
super comfy bed,Positive,,,,,
The front desk staff could not answer any of my questions or explain fraudulent charges to my room that I did not charge or authorize anyone else to either.,Positive,,,,,
My tail light was shattered and marks on my bumper from my truck being hit in the parking lot overnight.,Negative,,,,,
"It's been a long time since I stayed in a hotel and the staff was patient in explaining the parking lots, the card swiping entrance and exits, and the skywalk usage.  Breakfast info would have been nice to have in the room.",Positive,,,,,
"I desided to dine-in, at 3three3, Christian was my bartender. He was friendly and allowed me to taste a few wines by the glass. I settled on a bottle, and he forgot to pour the wine and leave a glass. I went 5 minutes before having to ask for my drink order. When he handed me the bottle he complained about other guests not tippingâ€¦ Christian and Summer, the bartenders were more interested in speaking with their manager regarding schedules that taking care of guests.",Positive,,,,,
No included breakfast. No free parking.,Positive,,,,,
"My room was on floor 8, the noise from the street was very loud. 

Room service for a steak dinner. They provided a flimsy plastic fork and knife incapable of penetrating the steak.",Negative,,,,,
3 suggestions: Upgrade washing machines and dryers to non-coin operated. Having to go down to the desk for quarters is history.  2. Get Amazon Prime for games at restaurant/bar.  3. No rag or sponges ever for wiping counters in suite. Spills have to get cleaned with good white washcloths.,Positive,,,,,
"The dry sauna was closed for maintenance. We were looking forward to using it, totally understand, things break sometimes. The steam room smelled a little mildewy/moldy(?). The hot tub and pool were nice!",Positive,,,,,
Pay for parking even for members.Pay for breakfast.,Positive,,,,,
They charged us more money than other family member that stayed. We were there for my mothers funeral. Very disappointing why some got lower rates.,Negative,,,,,
Winnie the receptionist was exceptional! Very friendly and accommodating!! She made the stay a whole lot more enjoyable.,Positive,,,,,
Breakfast service needs improvement.. waiter not attentive.,Positive,,,,,
My husband and I had a room that was not fitting for a Motel 6 location. The condition is documented in several photos we have taken through our visit. We had to leave early due to the room had continuous water linking into from the roof and we were exposed to black mold which made us very sick. We moved to the hotel next door and was sick for three days due to being continuously exposed to the mold and my asthma issue. I had to seek medical attention at local hospital for a breathing treatment and would like a full refund. This hotel was awful and was the worst hotel I have ever stayed at.,Negative,,,,,
Should clean sliding glass doors.,Positive,,,,,
Parking fees wasn't disclosed during booking,Neutral,,,,,
Didnâ€™t like the fact that we were going to be charged for parking and for breakfastâ€¦usually included especially with the price we already paid to stay.,Positive,,,,,
We were incredibly happy that we ended up stopping in after 7pm and having a room available. They had us checked in quickly. I think the price was very fair for what we got and would definitely come back in the future.,Positive,,,,,
Shy was great to work with. The room was great. I was surprised at how tiny the bathroom was.,Positive,,,,,
Needs some update and TLC. Window in room fogged over. Seal must be broken.,Negative,,,,,
"Some difficulty with car entry and exit. Ok, but it was raining",Negative,,,,,
Food and beverage were very expensive. Online site said breakfast was included,Positive,,,,,
Parking not on site.,Negative,,,,,
Clean better! Fix broken air-conditioning units,Positive,,,,,
Pool vÃ¶llig Ã¼berfÃ¼llt. Keine Aufsicht die wenigstens die Mindestsicherheitsregeln einfordert.,Negative,,,,,
"We booked through a wedding code, in that online reservation I did not read that there would be an additional $10.00 parking fee! Not happy about that additional charge! Way too expensive for our needs! We checked in after 1:00 am and checked out at 10am and to charge that much for a room is absolutely ridiculous!! Also when checking in my other adult wanted to get into the room to sleep and as I mentioned it was 1am and she was not allowed to get a key to the room until I got there! I feel that if the adult had ID they should have been able to get a room key! Credit card info was on file! She had to wait in the lobby for 40 minutes until I got there off the bus! Not satisfied with that! You do not meet any customer needs!! I will definitely not recommend this hotel when my son gets married next spring to any guest of his wedding!",Positive,,,,,
"Do not like to be charged additional fee for parking, when a guest in your hotel you should be able to use the parking facilities, after all its the norm that guests arrive by car where else should they put it but the parking lot of the hotel where they are staying!",Positive,,,,,
Wonâ€™t be staying again since u taxed the taxes I had to pay with your extremely high city taxes. Feels illegal,Negative,,,,,
"Das Hotel ist sehr gut gelegen fÃ¼r einen Besuch in Green Bay. Wir haben leider keine Ecksuite bekommen, obwohl die BestÃ¤tigung dies aussagte. Das Zimmer war trotzdem sehr gerÃ¤umig und gut ausgestattet, aber das Bad war entgegen der BestÃ¤tigung sehr klein. Die Suite war leider auch sehr dunkel und auch etwas veraltet. DrauÃŸen vor dem Fenster lief ein Ventilator, der nachts beim Schlafen etwas stÃ¶rte. 
Das Personal an der Rezeption war sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit.",Negative,,,,,
I was unhappy with the parking. We had to pay for parking and then came back and there was no were to park. We had to park in a public lot. The front desk staff refunded our parking cost. There should not be a fee for parking if you are a guest. It should be included in your cost of the room. There was no continental breakfast. I will most likely not stay in this hotel again.,Positive,,,,,
"Spider issues on balcony were taken care of each time we needed them to clean the webs.  Unfortunately this hotel does not spray for bugs, spiders, insects so keeping up with the webs was difficult.  Could not use balcony and enjoy nice weather.  However, the staff did try to take care of issue when requested.",Positive,,,,,
Was charged more for the room than it said online. Supposed to be 150 and was charged 175. Not sure the reason but I donâ€™t think I got the room I was supposed to get,Positive,,,,,
"We really liked the hotel location and the size of our room. The room could have been cleaner. Cob webs on the ceiling, ceiling vent was black/dirty, water stains on the ceiling. Bathroom was also spacious and was clean.",Positive,,,,,
"Wonderful front desk associates! Very helpful, friendly, responsive.",Positive,,,,,
"I am not at all happy with our stay at the Hyatt hotel this past weekend. We are parent's of the bride and groom, and I have heard nothing but complains from eveyone that stayed in your hotel Sat night. Fist of all, when we were sent an email saying our rooms were available to check in, and we go to check in, you charged eveyone another $25.00!! What a joke. No one from the wedding was even at the hotel once they were on the shuttle bus to the venue. They were just looking to put their suitcases in their room because they were told it was ready. They should have left it in the vehicles! Then charged twice for taxes on this??????? How is this even legal to do?? We will be checking on this. Then you didn't have enough space for parking once we got to the hotel so we had to go to the parking ramp and walk 15 minutes to our rooms!!! And charged another $10.00 to park?? We didn't get back to the hotel parking garage with a vehicle until 1:20am Sunday morning!!!! We didn't even have a vehicle in the parking lot until then and had to check out by 11. So, $10.00 added to our bill for 10 hours of parking???? This is absolutely ridiculous. Added below is our bill of all these extra chargrs!!! Needless to say, all the family and friends that stayed there, will never be staying at this hotel in the future if this is how you do things. So upsetting and what a disappointment charging all this.

"Ridiculous to have to pay to park in the parking lot at the hotel you're staying at, that is already way over-priced!",Negative,,,,,
Couldnâ€™t believe how noisy it was. Saturday night it was well after midnight before things quieted down,Positive,,,,,
Very clean. Elevators were operable so thatâ€™s always a plus. No cobwebs anywhere that my spider radar could detect.,Positive,,,,,
"WOULD SUGGEST HAVING THIS HOTEL REMODELED. PARTICULAR AREAS ARE TOILET SIZE = TOO LOW TO THE GROUND, CARPET AND FAKE SUEDE ITEMS SHOULD ALL BE REPLACED, SOFA BED MATTRESS SHOULD BE REPLACED, DOORS INSIDE ROOMS SERVING BATHROOM AND BEDROOM SHOULD BE REPLACED. ALSO - SAUNA WAS OUT OF ORDER DURING OUR STAY. WE WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO USING IT.",Positive,,,,,
Always love my stay when I come,Positive,,,,,

"No parking available, but was being charged to park.",Positive,,,,,
The pillows were awesome! What brand are they? Iâ€™d love to purchase some.,Positive,,,,,
"Breakfast closed at 10am, showed up at 10:02 am. Denied service which is technically right.  However, seating 2 people would have been considering going the extra mile; disappointing...
Also, paying an additional $10.00 for parking is absurd; disappointing...",Negative,,,,,
Was sad to see they were no longer offering the breakfast as part of the stay. Especially since competitors in this area offer free parking and breakfast at similar rates.,Positive,,,,,
There was no mention of a fee for parking until checkout.  I don't feel that's an appropriate fee.,Positive,,,,,
We were woke out of a sound sleep by someone pounding on our door and running through the halls.  This happened many times during the night but we could not catch the people that were doing this.,Negative,,,,,
Should not need to pay for parking if a guest at the hotel,Negative,,,,,
We had a pet with us and all her experience was great as well. We felt welcomed and it was thoughtful to make sure there were supplies by the grass area. Everyone was super nice with our dog and made us feel welcome.,Positive,,,,,
Room was extremely humid all surfaces felt moist,Negative,,,,,
"A word about parking and how/where to enter the hotel would be helpful in the pre-arrival email communication. We arrived after 10 pm and followed the GPS to the hotel, found a parking lot that was barred (bank lot) and a sign on the barricade directing hotel guests to the parking ramp across Main Street. We parked in the empty ramp and took the  skyway across to the hotel, followed signs directing us to the lobby, but found ourselves trapped in a stairwell landing requiring a room key to open the locked hotel entry door. We called the front desk and a staff member came and opened the door for us and led us to the lobby to check in.",Positive,,,,,
I was told if I checked in early Iâ€™d pay $25.00 I was than charged a 2nd room tax on top of the first room tax . So I was paying a room tax twice not only did my bill say $38 the 2nd time my banking says $78 was taken out not sure really why?,Positive,,,,,
"There was three of us staying work related, we have stayed before, our start time is 7am, no breakfast till then. Would be 5 stars if breakfast was served at 6am. We will probably be booking elsewhere because of this, thank you",Positive,,,,,

Hyatt Regency GB is my favorite hotel in Wisconsin. Great job!,Positive,,,,,
Only negative was parking in garage and walking back to hotel late at night.,Negative,,,,,
"After receiving emailed copies of our receipts, there were several errors and overage charges. I called and spoke with Winnie at the front desk, who could not help me then proceeded to try and get me off the phone to help someone else who was standing in front of her. I asked her why she wasn't willing to continue helping me. She was very unprofessional. I left my name and number with her to forward to her manager, who she said wouldn't be back in the office until 9/1/2022. I will be calling back then if I do not receive a response from James. Thank you.",Positive,,,,,
Worked with Mike Jubert and he did a great job in setting up our event.,Positive,,,,,
The hot tub was shut down and that was not disclosed beforehand so we were very disappointed in that.,Negative,,,,,
Always a great place to stay,Positive,,,,,
Very neat place!,Positive,,,,,
There was knocking on our door at 10:30 am when our check out was not till 12pm.,Neutral,,,,,
"All of the staff was wonderful. The room is in need of an upgrade. It was perfectly clean, but the decor feels dated. The restaurant was delicious for lunch and dinner, but the first morning only the buffet breakfast was available and we would have preferred menu options. We decided to skip breakfast at the hotel for the remainder of our stay, but we repeatedly came back for lunch and dinner.",Positive,,,,,
Overcharged,Neutral,,,,,
Breakfast prices are way to expensive,Positive,,,,,
I was not satisfied with the time I was allowed to check in for a wedding. I contacted the hotel 2 times during the week for an early check in at 1. I was told it was noted but to call in the morning. I contacted the hotel on Saturday morning and was told I could not check in at 1 unless I paid a fee.,Positive,,,,,
Friday stay had a lot of noise in the atrium until 3:00 am.  Not conducive for sleeping when you have to get up and work at a customer the next day,Positive,,,,,
Parking problems,Negative,,,,,
James is wonderful,Positive,,,,,
Very loud!  Definitely needs some upgrades. Beds were comfortable.,Positive,,,,,
Very nice hotel.,Positive,,,,,
"Itâ€™s time to touch-up the scratched and faded wooden furniture. No need to toss it out, but simply use a rag with dark stain and then polish. Itâ€™s looking rather tired",Negative,,,,,
I think the parking fee is excessive...if you're staying in the hotel I would hope parking would be included.,Positive,,,,,
Fix your parking.  There was a wedding and we were paid hotel guests that drove around for 15 min. looking for parking any time we left hotel. Why if we paid for hotel stay did we have to pay $5 for parking?,Negative,,,,,
We did have a couple of issues that were taken care of right away. The manager even contacted me the day we checked out to insure everything was ok. Very impressive!,Positive,,,,,
"Towels were replaced, but the bed wasn't done after we left the room",Neutral,,,,,
Several times we had difficulty finding a spot in the lot designated for hotel guests paid parking. Actually had to park on the street once and them come back to try circling for a spot to open up. Seems like if you pay for parking there should be a guaranteed spot for you. Told staff and thought they would have refunded for the fee but did not offer. Just told us where public pay parking was. We walked around the convention area just to see it and kids were throwing a football (real not foam) from a balcony down to the main floor and back up. We had to ask them to stop while we passed because it was not safe.  For these reasons we wont be staying there again.,Positive,,,,,
Pool area was nasty and a mess. I tried checking in the world of hyatt line at front desk and was TOTALLY IGNORED?! I just got in another line and the front desk lady was unusually rude long check in process the entire experience was unpleasant.,Negative,,,,,
"The elevator noise in our room was horrendous. That, coupled with the atrium and the HVAC made for a nearly sleepless night.",Negative,,,,,
They only feedback is that if you are going to allow pets please fix the damage they make to a room. As a person who is highly allergic it was uncomfortable for me to have my room chewed up by an animal. The woodwork in the bathroom and throughout the room was eaten up-gross!,Negative,,,,,
Pillows were too thick/hard. No variety in softness. No grab bar in bath/shower-major issue.,Positive,,,,,
We spoke casually to Tracy from I believe she said Guest Sales.  She was so delightful & pleasant to talk with.  She even ordered us some cheese curds which we had never had & they were delicious.  Everyone at hotel was very friendly.  It was a beautiful hotel & we really enjoyed our stay there.,Positive,,,,,
"Everything was great, thanks.",Positive,,,,,
"The balcony was really kind of a joke.  I expected more when they said a table and two chairs on the advertisement which is why I upgraded.  Fitting two people on it would be difficult to do so we didnâ€™t end up using it.  The parking was hard to find because there was a sign to park off Main Street that wasnâ€™t removed.  Furthermore, the lobby was noisy even at later hours of the night and could be heard from our room.  Kind of disappointed as we love Hyatt hotels.",Positive,,,,,
Staff was great and room was outstanding.,Positive,,,,,
You should be able to order food at the restaurant from the hotel room phone. We were told the restaurant didnâ€™t have a phone number which prevented us from ordering food then go to pick it up. My husband walked there to order. Came back to the room. Then walked back to the restaurant to pick up the food. Also more kid choices at the restaurant is needed.,Positive,,,,,
"Our stay was fine, I thought the dresser in our room was ""tired looking, there was also a towel left behind the bathroom door from a previous guest. The check out line was quite long because everyone needed to get their parking ticket validated",Positive,,,,,
Parking fee to guest is unreasonable.,Negative,,,,,
The breafast was at 7:00 am. Most Hotels are earlier. Had to be at class at 7. Breakfast should be earlier,Positive,,,,,
We were given a corner room which we didnâ€™t purchase. This caused problems for our party as there was no divider as there would have been in the suite we paid for.,Negative,,,,,
Staff was friendly and helpful.,Positive,,,,,
I can't thank-you enough for how accommodating the staff was to support our working needs.  Everyone (and I do mean everyone) did everything they could to find ample quiet working space for my niece after check-out time.  It was VERY MUCH appreciated !   Kudos to everyone on your team - they are great representatives of your business.,Positive,,,,,
"Love your facility and have had the opportunity to stay many times.  The facility is great, and the staff is professional, knowledgeable, and very helpful.",Positive,,,,,
The hotel seems dated. Expected more from the Hyatt Regency Brand. Staff was super friendly and helpful,Positive,,,,,
"It was extremely frustrating to be told I was being charged for parking when due to an event the parking was full and as a result I had to park in a further location from hotel.  I realize this isn't the staff's fault and they did refund my parking, but  the experience wasn't a good one.",Positive,,,,,
Awesome staff.  Love this place.  Feels just like home.  Grandson wants to live here,Positive,,,,,
Why do you charge for parking when there are loads of free ramps nearby? I would have parked at a ramp instead had I known,Positive,,,,,
"Loved the rooms, pool, and breakfast, although the prices were high. Did not like the â€œsurpriseâ€ $10/night fee for parking, although the CS rep I spoke to at check- out took off the parking fee. I was not happy that my familyâ€™s rooms (2) were separated on different floors.",Positive,,,,,
"The staff response was excellent but that is what I would expect at a Hyatt.
Would recommend hooks in the bathroom for towels or robes.  Also a grab bar in the shower.",Positive,,,,,
"I was slightly disappointed in the bathroom.  It was pretty small for a suite and the toilet sat way to close to the ground.
Also, it needed more vents for the air conditioner.   Bedroom was cold but the living space did not cool off.",Negative,,,,,
"The 19 yr old bartender ignored most customers, while talking to one person instead. my drinks weren't made correctly, but I didn't want to send them back and wait even longer. There were only about 8 customers in there at that time. He served ""last call"", then told everyone to ""get out"", about 5 minutes later. We got plastic cups and left. There should be at least 20 minutes between serving last call and actual closing time. He didn't need to be rude.",Positive,,,,,
Loved having an early check in ready ASAP.,Positive,,,,,
It was definitely not what it used to be. Severely disappointed,Positive,,,,,
"I had written in the comments that my sister and I wanted adjoining rooms.  It seemed no one read our comments and my sister had to wait over an hour for her room to be cleaned.
I booked this hotel for the sofa pull out bed.  We had to have 3 people try to pull it out, it was stuck.  It looked like no one had paid attention to the bedding/bed in years.  The sofa bed was so uncomfortable that my 9 year old wouldn't sleep on it.
Road traffic was very noisy and teens were running the halls at 2:00 am.",Negative,,,,,
"It would have been better if the hotel had supplied a door tag ""No room service necessary"" for eco-friendly reason.",Positive,,,,,
The only thing I was not happy or satisfied with was having to pay overnight parking at a hotel I was staying at other than that it was a wonderful stay.,Positive,,,,,
"We were staying on points for one night. My pet peeve is when I stay on points at a hotel being given the worst room - because Iâ€™m staying on points. I have a lot of hotel stays throughout the year both for business or pleasure across different hotel brands. We were put right outside the elevator for our recent stay, it was unbelievably loud at night with us being able to hear every word of the elevator conversations. And, because there were 3 of us - not everyone could sleep in the room behind the door - we had people on the sofa bed who had the worst sleep ever with all the noise. When I was being checked in there was actually discussion about if the sofa bed was needed and how many beds were needed, so I was pretty annoyed to find we were out right outside the elevator doors.",Positive,,,,,
Carpeting in room had ripples and folds in main traffic area-needs re-installation or replacement.,Positive,,,,,
"I had to pay for parking due to the parking lot being full, which added an unexpected expense to my stay.",Negative,,,,,
We most likely will not stay at this hotel again. We will definitely be back in Green Bay as we are Packer fans.,Negative,,,,,
"Apparently the New Orleans Saints football team was staying at the hotel while we were. There were security guards with guns everywhere, which made me and my young children very uncomfortable. The entire football team including players, coaches and the press were there. They actually held some kind of press conference in the lobby area while we were trying to walk through to our room. There were actual fans sitting outside of the hotel yelling for autographs. The staff was flustered and totally unprepared. Honestly there should be some kind of indication that that was happening because we would have booked another hotel. We were not able to relax or enjoy our stay at all with all these famous football roaming around the hotel. It feels like a wasted trip and wasted money.",Positive,,,,,
Check in went excellent. Trainee was outstanding. I had an issue with breakfast tickets the next day and the front desk clerk at that time was less than helpful. I then went to breakfast manager who was helpful,Positive,,,,,
Samantha was extremely helpful and very efficient!!,Positive,,,,,
Water was dripping out the a/c in the ceiling in out room 834. Needs to be address,Negative,,,,,
"1. We were on the 2nd floor facing main street - loud and loud. The room did not stop the traffic noise at all. It was super frustrating to be awake at midnight due to the noise. 
2. The lounge/restaurant was out of limes. Who runs out of limes? They also did not have ginger beer to make Moscow Mules.   Odd for being a bar/lounge in Wisconsin.
3. While the front desk staff was nice - there was no mention of any kind about being a World of Hyatt member which I thought upon check in was supposed to occur. I felt I received nothing on this visit for being a World member.
4. The room smell - I mentioned my dis-satisfaction to the front desk upon check out - no real concern about it. Trust me - it should be concerning. I had to wash every piece of clothes in all suitcases as the clothes picked up that smell from just 1 night. 
5. I can say the poo/hot tub/sauna and steam room were great - no issues

In summary, I personally will not make the Hyatt my top option when visiting Green Bay. The thought of the room smell alone makes me shy away from staying again. Too bad - we love the appearance of the lobby and the pool area.",Positive,,,,,
"Cassiana Madary should be commended, she handled everything for our stay.
She is very knowledgeable and courteous!!!",Positive,,,,,
"Initially gave us a one bed room. Had reserved 2 beds. Desk clerk would not help us. Asked for manager. She got us a 2 bed immediately. If it wasnâ€™t for her, we would have left.",Neutral,,,,,
"I didnâ€™t feel there were any benefits being a Hyatt member, even a free watered wouldâ€™ve been a nice gesture",Positive,,,,,
"I was a little disappointed that I was not made aware ahead of time that parking was an additional fee.  There were additional events going on that same weekend so I was unable to park in the hotel parking lot and was still charged for parking.  I was also informed last minute that I would be charged $50 a night on my credit card for incidentals, which will be returned to my credit card 7-10 business days later,  but payment for the room and the parking were charged immediately.  I feel this is unacceptable. Last year when I made my vacation trip and stayed across the street at the Hampton Inn, these were not an issue.",Negative,,,,,
Nice property and staff.,Positive,,,,,
The front desk refused to put us on any level but 2 because we were using free nights... indicated the hotel was fully booked. Yea it was abandoned.. couple behind me didn't have a reservation and they were given 7th floor.,Positive,,,,,
The breakfast is lacking... lower quality food compared to rest of hotel,Positive,,,,,
"I was there on business, therefore everything covered financially by them.
Upon checkin, I gave them a credit card for incidentals.  However, when I returned home, I was billed for my stay.  I reached out right away.  Our contact person did as well.  I was reassured that I would be credited on Monday.  It is now Wednesday and the bill is still charged to me.  I am disappointed in how this was handled.

Again, I supplied a credit card for incidentals.  I do NOT understand how I was billed in the first place.

Thank you for listening.",Positive,,,,,
Check-in was at 4 p.m. We were there by 4.15 or so and had to wait a half hour before our room was ready.,Positive,,,,,
"A sincere Thank you to the wonderful staff at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. Everyone was kind, gracious, helpful, and super attentive to our needs. I appreciate the extra special attention to detail and for help with my UPS delivery and mailing my postcards! Kudos!",Positive,,,,,
Overall stay was nice. The hotel is beautiful but the rooms are a bit dated compared to other hyatts I have stayed at.,Positive,,,,,
Bed sheets were ripped up and floor/carpet was very dirty.,Negative,,,,,
"We stayed at the hotel checked in and when we walked into our room they had ""upgraded us"" we specifically stayed at this hotel and paid $300/night to have a pull out couch and for our girls. They put us in a suite with no place for our girls to sleep. We went down to the desk and said they couldn't do anything for us. No rooms to move us to and no manager was on duty to speak to. Then we went down in the morning and more people were checking in and still no manager to speak to that could do anything for us. We finally were able to speak to the hotel manager Jacob and asked for a refund for the 1st night. The room we got was a room we did not book and they were not able to change rooms. As of today we still have not received the 1 night refund. I would like someone to follow up with us.",Positive,,,,,
"Exceptional service, absolutely amazing! Myself and my bridal party stayed Friday night (8/12) and got ready 8/13. We called down for some extra things we needed. Staff promptly brought everything with no complaints or hesitation. We felt so at home and comfortable all day! Saturday night we stayed (bride & groom), again Sunday had a couple things brought up promptly. James at the front desk 5-stars! Best hotel stay weâ€™ve had in a very long time! Thanks for making our wedding weekend so special.",Positive,,,,,
Manager was great.  Fixed MY reservation issue with a smile and accommodated my needs/wants.,Positive,,,,,
"My only dissatisfaction with the stay was that there was an unexpected parking charge. I live in GB. The only reason for the hotel was for safety (not drinking & driving). The gated parking lot and need to get my ticket validated was all new to me, as it's been many years since I have stayed at this particular Hyatt.",Positive,,,,,
Cleanliness was poor.,Positive,,,,,
Bedding on pullout bed..one blanket had hair all over it.  2nd white puffier comforter had several fresh blood drops on corner of blanket.  Bathroom much smaller than would normally get with a comparative rate..very little counter space.  Got extra sheets.  A full length mirror wouldve been great addition also.  Didnt find worth for value considering had to pay to check in early and for parking.  Fee Wasnt mentioned when I called and asked if we could check in early and they said we would be put on list.,Positive,,,,,
A pet friendly hotel should not apply a fee that is taxed to guests staying less than 24 hours in the hotel. If such a fee is assessed then what is being provided to my pet when he is bringing his own bed?,Positive,,,,,

I got Covid while staying at the hotel.,Neutral,,,,,
Parking situation deplorable. Bathroom beyond small with a kindergarten toilet.,Negative,,,,,
"I was there for a conference and the food at the conference was horrible.  The pork had some kind of weird lemon sauce on it and the mashed potatoes were rock hard.  The chicken was really dry.  Breakfast was okay but really greasy hash browns and bacon.  The staff at breakfast was VERY nice and helpful though.  Also, the treadmills in the workout room were not working properly.  When you try and press the screens you cannot set the speed, incline, etc. because the screens don't work.  Also, I brought a tax exempt form but still had to fill out another form with the exact same info on it - including the hotel info - you should have that part filled out ahead of time.  The beds were really comfortable and room was quiet and comfortable.",Positive,,,,,
"I always stayed here before when it was different hitel chains and they always had breakfast in the mornings. I saw people in atrium earing breakfast, but didnt see any signs or their was nothing in the rooms avout breakfast. Included or not.",Positive,,,,,
"There is not much to say about my overnight stay. The upgrade to a suite was appreciated. Other than that, I arrived and checked in, had a sandwich and a few drinks at the Pub 333, returned to my room, watched the news, went to sleep, woke up, and checked out.",Positive,,,,,
Love staying here - we make it about once a year.  The building is starting to show its age.,Positive,,,,,
Renovate and clean the rooms!! Absolutely appalling!,Negative,,,,,
There was a lack of parking in the hotel lot.  Requested parking fee to be waived.,Negative,,,,,
The pool seemed as if it could be kept more clean. However the sauna and steam rooms were splendid.,Positive,,,,,
The room carpet is old. It will need to be replaced in the near future.,Neutral,,,,,
"Staff was professional and courteous. Check in and check out snaking. Overall, decent property but it is starting to show age, like markings on walls, trim pieces loose. Also, exterior windows need cleaning.",Positive,,,,,
"I was attending a conference. While in a meeting room in a meeting, having a working lunch, without acknowledging any of the group, people started reconfiguring the room for a wedding. (Imagine taking down tables and bringing in a telescoping ladder as weâ€™re conducting business as though we arenâ€™t even there.) Apparentlh this room a that I was under the impression I had access to until 2 - was needed for a wedding at 3. There was clearly a misunderstanding, and that was not anyoneâ€™s fault, but it seems that it would have been polite for the employees to say something like, â€œI see youâ€™re still working here. We were told we need to turn the room over. Could I find you another place to work?â€ (Or something like this.) But being ignored felt a bit unprofessional at best, if not downright rude.",Negative,,,,,
Parking is terrible and continues to be a problem,Negative,,,,,
"All interactions with staff were excellent, truly 5 stars and above and beyond.",Positive,,,,,
Hotel in need of updating- rooms and furnishings are outdated.,Negative,,,,,
The room was not appealing and dark. There weren't bedspreads just tucked in covers which made the beds look messy. The wall color was drab. The micro suede sofa had stains on it. Only an office chair available other than that. The entire room didn't have a warm and inviting feeling. It was very basic.,Positive,,,,,
Everyone was courteous and professional!,Positive,,,,,
I'd work on speeding up the elevators in the next renovation ;).,Positive,,,,,
I wonâ€™t stay at the property again due to early check in policy,Positive,,,,,
The breakfast was not good and very expensive. I have not been to a hotel in many years where the breakfast is not included.,Positive,,,,,
I think there shouldâ€™ve been free coffee 24 seven other than that the stay was amazing,Positive,,,,,
My TV remote did not work great and your rooms are getting a little tired looking.  The lunches at the conference were very good,Positive,,,,,
The hotel is looking really run down. I had a loud leak in my room. Walls looking dingy.,Negative,,,,,
It's a bit dated in appearance,Neutral,,,,,
"This is the 2nd year we have stayed with you, and we thank you for accommodating us.",Positive,,,,,
"Great, friendly people everywhere! The complimentary breakfast was pretty bad. I ate around 9 each morning and the food in the warmers was old and I could tell it had been there quite awhile. On top of that, none of it was very warm. Not the quality or freshness we're used to at a Hyatt hotel.",Positive,,,,,
I had some trouble at checkin with my debit card. I checked in on a Thursday and expected to pay for the room on Friday when my funds would be available.  The staff would not budge on my request to have them run the card the next day.  I had my family there and had to scramble for a half hour to get another card set up to get us checked in.  It was very frustrating.  I would have liked the staff to be a little more forgiving and have a  little flexibility in this case.,Positive,,,,,
"Difficult to get into parking lot and when exiting, tried to charge me $ 36 !!!!!",Negative,,,,,
"They told us breakfast was free because we were part of a wedding block. when we went the staff told us to grab a plate. Eggs were ice cold and coffee was boiling hot. Then when we got to leave the staff said we had to pay $15, so we didn't want to cause a scene so we paid and left and went somewhere else.",Negative,,,,,
"Great place, Ihave stayed here several times and have always been happy. Only comment I can think of... I don't mind using the stairs as I value the exercise, but you need more elevators.",Positive,,,,,
Mattresses were uncomfortable on both queen beds. Ala carte breakfast menus wasn't available,Positive,,,,,
"I checked in August 4 and room was nicely serviced August 5. I had left a tip.   That night I spilled part of a bottle of water on the bed.  The morning of August 6 I left a note with tip that it was only water and no need to change bed.  On August 6 no one serviced my room, but someone came and took the $3 I had left on the counter next to the note.",Positive,,,,,
Please improve the speed of the elevators. Everything else was lovely.,Positive,,,,,
Breakfast was not as good as previous years. There was a very limited selection at the buffet and no omelet station.,Positive,,,,,
Serving staff at breakfast was slow and poor.,Negative,,,,,
"Overall, it was a great experience. However, the elevators were extrememly slow. The day of check-out, we waited over 10 minutes for an elevator to come get us on the 8th floor. Secondly, it was VERY loud overnight. I know the hotel cannot control the emergency sirens outside, but I was very disappointed to be woken almost hourly because of emergency sirens outside.",Negative,,,,,
"Got 1 tiny bottle of shampoo for 2 persons staying 3 nights.  Had to ask the front desk for more.  Elevators are slow.  Balcony, for which we were charged extra, was at best illusory, because it is so small that the 3 items of furniture touch each other.  You would have to climb over a chair to sit in it.  It overlooked a demolition site.  The door was covered with spider webs.  The carpet is wrinkled.  Availability of electrical outlets was excellent.  The refrigerator fits so tightly under the bar that it's difficult to open without pinching a finger or an entire hand between the door and the bar.  There was no wastebasket in the bedroom.  The mirror behind the bar is positioned relative to the lighting so that when you stand in front of it you are backlighted and can't see yourself well.  We liked having a second suitcase stand in the bedroom.",Positive,,,,,
"James at the front desk was outstanding. Anticipated our needs, helped me focus on what an issue actually was with early check-in, and solved it even before I hit my designated check-in time. His foresight for guests' needs is top-notch.",Positive,,,,,
"Wife's breakfast oatmeal was poorly prepared.  Lumps of cold, nearly uncooked throughout the bowl.  Server apologetic: however, no offer to bring another and bill not adjusted.  When I checked out, desk attendant never asked how my stay was or if there were any issues.  It is hard to reach me by phone; so, please email me: hockeyrefkenneth@gmail.com",Positive,,,,,
Room was a little dark and elevators were a little slow. Overall good experience tho.,Positive,,,,,

"The  room  was 701.  Stuck in a corner, can't  get a cart in the room.  We had to carry stuff from hall to room. Same as when we left.
   The shower was very interesting,  the water was running  out on the floor, I had to spend more time keeping the water from over flowing onto the floor. Not very level!
   The staff was very helpful  in finding  and returning my pill packet.
   Thank you.",Positive,,,,,
"poor design of elevators (or poor maintenance). we were in room 202. as soon as the elevator starts to move, there is a loud noise and vibration!  there are a lot of rooms in the hotel and the elevator is constantly moving, and at 2 am and at 3.4 am it is impossible to sleep, I woke up many times and got up broken in the morning. when we checked in around 9 pm and got into the room, I immediately noticed this sound and vibration, after which I went down to the reception and asked to change our room.  I was told that there are no rooms, and the main thing they said: it's probably the sound of the elevator, but don't you have earplugs to sleep?  Seriously?!  What else do I need to take with me to relax in your hotel, Hyatt?  maybe shock absorbers on the legs of the bed to not feel the vibration?  I hate it.  a broken state of health and a ruined day.",Negative,,,,,
"Parking fee was unexpected, and the free ramp on the weekend should have been communicated more clearly",Positive,,,,,

I paid for a queen bed and I am positive the bed was not a true queen size. This is my only complaint,Positive,,,,,
"No communication prior to arrival as to how to enter parking lot to check in. I attempted three times on chat service to get information and could never connect. We had to pull on to a side street and call front desk after circling hotel to find information. Should come with instructions with booking. Hotel very dated, does not appear as shown on booking site. Breakfast was overcooked,had to cut biscuits with a knife! I rarely have ever given a bad review but this was terribly disappointing. Only a handful of guests yet no handicap rooms available? Staff were very friendly but location and condition and accessibility to enter hotel were not.",Negative,,,,,
All of the staff is 5 star and exceptional in service.,Positive,,,,,
Just a very nice place to stay. They kept everyone safe throughout Covid and run a very nice facility.  It is also walking distance to some great food & bars.,Positive,,,,,
"We were forced to park across the street, then walk in the rain in order to get back in the hotel. That was absolutely terrible and we will not return because of the lack of parking situation there.",Negative,,,,,
this is the first time I ever had to pay for hotel parking.  not happy,Positive,,,,,
Once again a very enjoyable stay. Travelling for work- room very comfortable like the work area seperate from the sleeping area. All of the staff so very helpful and friendly. Would not hesitate to highly recommend you to all regardless of travelling on business or pleasure. Pub staff also very friendly- overall a great stay-Thank You,Positive,,,,,
Front desk assistance was anazing . She helped us tremendously abd went above and beyond.,Positive,,,,,
Recently stayed at a Wyndham hotel and was disappointed with the cleanliness of the room.   Booked this hotel and was a little nervous but pleasantly surprised. Only comment is to have a self check out in the food area when there is no staff available. Bringing the clerk over while she was busy seemed like it caused more waiting for everyone.,Positive,,,,,
Multiple Spiders in the room. Rooms need some updating. Sheets were pilling and scratchy.,Positive,,,,,
The condition of the hotel was below what I have come to expect from Hyatt. I was disappointed to have to change rooms after a long drive. The staff I interacted with were professional and courteous.,Positive,,,,,
"Parking lot would not let me out without paying any of the times. After I paid me day the deal person told me I could have my ticket validated, but they was my last day. My key card never was set up to operate the parking gate. I had to park in a public lot down the road. My key card would not allow me entrance to the hotel from the doors near the skywalk. Late at night my little daughter and I had to walk on busy Main Street carrying all our bags to gain entry to the hotel. It was EXTREMELY inconvenient!!!",Positive,,,,,
I didn't receive any housekeeping of my room.,Neutral,,,,,
My only concern was about parking and the staff was friendly and explained that public parking process once the hotelâ€™s parking filled up.,Positive,,,,,

Major update and remodel needed at this property.,Positive,,,,,
"For the amount of money paid for the rooms (we had a balcony) you should include breakfast, or at the very least a coupon for a discount on the breakfast.  Breakfast costs was astronomical!  $42+ for the 2 egg breakfast, a skillet and 2 milks? Unbelievable!  Should also tell people where they can park if the lot is full right away, instead of having to pull in to the full lot, run into the registration desk, and ask what to do. Then having to ask for the $10/night parking fee to be removed because we couldn't park in the lot either night.  I get it, it's a revenue stream for the hotel, but the communication could have been improved a little.",Positive,,,,,
"The Hyatt Regency in Green Bay seemed dated from a structural perspective.  The staff members were great with check in other than we were going to receive a text message when our room was ready and we did not.  The team also supported our 15th wedding anniversary very sweetly with a nice signed card and bottle of wine which my wife and I certainly appreciated.  Breakfast was great from a food perspective, but the service was not great.  It took a long time after seating to get an order taken with staff standing around.  (Maybe not waiters, but misleading) Overall it was a nice experience, but I would not say I was WOW'd.",Positive,,,,,
Your parking situation is not ideal.  I am pleased the parking charges were taken off my bill as the lot was full when I returned Saturday evening.  I till ended paying $15.00 out of my pocket for parking at your hotel.,Positive,,,,,
Great hotel! VERY Clean. No issues.,Positive,,,,,
See you next year ðŸ™‚,Positive,,,,,
"Had a breakfast buffet for my work meeting, and those little breakfast potatoes were delicious.",Positive,,,,,
We were disappointed that there was no continental breakfast included.  With small children who only eat small  amounts and like different things it is quite expensive.,Positive,,,,,
You should fix the parking issue.  Nobody explained it would be charged to my room.  I paid out of pocket every time I left.  Seems like there should be a better solution,Positive,,,,,

"We contacted the hotel to let them know we would be late for check-in.  We were told that ""the staff would be waiting for us to arrive"".  Samantha let us know she had noted our new arrival time and that she would be waiting for us.  What an unexpected and inviting message to receive when you are on the road.  Just wonderful.  At arrival, James was as pleasant and as kind as Samantha.  I also had to contact the front desk when I returned home the next day due to a billing question.  Again James was thorough, reassuring, and professional providing me with his name to let me know if I experienced billing problems in the days ahead to contact him.  Extremely good customer service.  We will stay there again.",Positive,,,,,
Toilet seemed unusually low. I was taken aback that hotel of HR  level would stoop to charging guests for parking.,Negative,,,,,
What a noisy hotel!  Noisy inside and lots of traffic noise from the outside.  And no fan in the AC system or bathroom to run to mute the noise.  I won't stay there again.,Negative,,,,,
Purchase of items at shop took very long.,Negative,,,,,
"The room was dated. Having said that, it was nicely appointed and everything worked. As a Globalist, I was called and offered an upgrade and when I arrived, the front desk manager was very kind. My only real complaint was that I waited at least 15 minutes to check in. There were several people in line and only one person working the check in desk. The express counter for Hyatt members was not open.",Positive,,,,,

"Front desk great, breakfast support staff was terrible. Food was good but the staff totally ignored multiple requests for beverages. We did not get any service until we were ready to leave.

"When I enquired whether my request for featherless bedding had been fulfilled, the Front Desk Staff contacted Housekeeping, who came up quickly to check the bedding, confirming that it was featherless. I was impressed at the very quick response. I am used to having to wait some time for staff to show up, so their promptness was very refreshing.",Positive,,,,,
"Staff members at the front counter were very friendly and helpful throughout my stay. There was one small encounter (over the phone) that wasn't very welcoming. I drove in from out of town and wanted more information about parking, so I called prior to checking in and spoke with a man who was quite rude and dismissive of my questions. I had a much better experience with the women at the front counter, but that initial phone call made a bad first impression.",Positive,,,,,
"The toilet was small, and the seat was wobbly.",Negative,,,,,
The limited dinner menu was great & affordable. The brunch was overpriced for the options provided. The cleaning staff was so nice & room was very clean. Should have more than 6 luggage racks for a convention checkout process.,Positive,,,,,
My stay was lovely as usual! The staff at the check-in desk was wonderful.,Positive,,,,,
Very expensive mediocre breakfast,Negative,,,,,
"I was disappointed with the selection of restaurants near the hotel. There weren't any. If there is a Starbucks in Green Bay, I never saw it. Information on food and drink in the area would be very helpful.",Positive,,,,,
"I was there to work the convention.  I have stayed at other hyatt hotels and other franchises. These would be my concerns: 
1. No towel bars in any of the bathrooms not even for hand towels. The shower head was loose in the wall. And there was practically not water pressure. I would suggest to have adjustable shower stream and hand held shower heads. 
2 we had to bring our towels to the front desk to get new ones. I understand not changing sheets for the weekend and putting dirty towels outside the room or in communal hamper on the floor. Last I checked I was paying over $128 per night for 3 nights. Last I checked that included housekeeping serves. 
3. I got breakfast free for working the con but my teens didn't.  When I found out it was $18 per person I was expecting gourmet feast. Not the smallest buffet on earth. You pay less and get more at a golden coral. Also found out later people not even staying at the hotel were walking in the side and getting breakfast for free. I have to say the holiday Inn has a way better hot buffet and it is complimentary. 
4. Having to pay to use the parking fir the hotel and not even being able to get a spot. We had to run to the store when we came back there was no parking so I had to go to the city ramp and pay for other parking.  It's funny because the hotel next to you was cheaper per night and had free parking and breakfast.  
5. The hyatt over booked and gave some of the rooms for kitsune workers to the soccer people they over booked. Forcing us to use your pull out couch.it which I got stuck with. You can not even call it a bed. It was literally springs and medal bars with a peice of fabric on it. I had to take the couch cusions the make a make shift bed on top to be able to sleep. As a suggestion have a pillow top mattress pad to be able to put on top or actually buy mattress that can be slept on. 
6. Finally, there were people screaming in the hotel lounge area by the elevators. They were screaming back and forth with people in the upper rooms. I had to work 7am to 330pm each day. I was lucky to get to sleep by 1am. The staff wanted to say something but were told by the manager not to interfere with the con. That was not the con it was in the hotel area. 
If we go to the con next year we will be staying and the hotel next door. 
One other thing. I have been a lifeguard for 4 yrs and an indoor pool. When there is a sever or lighting storm you need to get everyone out of the freaking pool. If lighting strikes the ground or the building they can be electrocuted. Some of your staff was ask if they need to get out and the manager said no they r fine it's indoors. 
I understand everyone is short on help and trying to do their best. If you need your guest to help out house keeping than either discount the price, offer free breakfast, or some other perk to make up for not getting services they are paying for",Positive,,,,,

Me and a couple of friends were threatened with eviction from our hotel room from James. We weren't even being loud we just had some turned down music while we watched T.V. Mind you this was 8:00 on a Friday in a completely booked out party-hardy anime convention. I refuse to believe that we were making that much noise if any at all. This was our first Kitsune Kon in 3 years this sucks!,Negative,,,,,
I would have liked to know before that I needed to bring the physical card on file instead of having to use a different one.,Positive,,,,,
The signage for parking was terribleâ€¦and confusing at entry. The worst part was paying for parking. That was never indicated when I made the reservation. Unacceptable.,Negative,,,,,
"Sineage regarding room cleaning varied a lot - the sheet I was given said daily, in one elevator it said every 3 days, and in the other it said every 4. Not a big deal, but a bit confusing.

Overall condition of hotel was very good and room was spacious and clean. AC could have cooled a bit better, but again...wasn't too bad.",Positive,,,,,
The line for checking in was huge and there was only one person checking people in,Negative,,,,,
I just wish the tissues were underneath the night stand because they were looked over several times when I really needed them and the tall lamp in the bed room didn't work at all,Positive,,,,,
A breakfast included in the price of the room would make the stay alot better.,Positive,,,,,
"James Pritchett (sp?) was phenomenal!  The battery on my Explorer was dead and when my daughter went to the front desk to see if anyone could help, James sprang into action. He went to his car to get his battery jumper and instantly helped us out. When I tried to give him some money for helping us, he refused and said he was happy to help and that knowing we were able to get home was all the thanks he needed. Top notch service.  I can't say enough about how wonderful and helpful James was.",Positive,,,,,
"The bed mattress on the pull out sofa could be better quality. 
There was no duvet cover to cover the pull out sofa.
Had to use just the blanket to cover the pull out sofa matt.",Positive,,,,,
Inform long term guest when traditional breakfast service won't be available and buffet will be served instead.,Positive,,,,,
Highly recomended,Positive,,,,,
Breakfast was excellent!,Positive,,,,,
The breakfast buffet hosted by Pub 3Three3 is not worth $16/person. I would personally pay $8 maximum for it.,Positive,,,,,
"Took off one for the elevator breaking down, but I was very impressed you got it fixed by that night. Usually, if a convention hotel elevator goes down, it's down for the rest of the weekend.",Positive,,,,,
Bed was stiff and the blankets were like paper,Positive,,,,,
"Hotel was very nice and clean, as it has been the last few conventions we attended. Only issues to mention was that Friday morning, around 8am, we were woke by pounding (hammering?) and what I'm assuming was drilling or cutting of something nearby. It was so loud that we could not sleep, and after being up the night before until after 2am, getting things ready for the convention, waking at 8 wasn't the best to start our day lol. The only real other issue we had was that Saturday night, I stopped by the desk and asked if we could have another roll of toilet paper, as we were almost out. (Had a roll and maybe a half roll when we got there Thursday afternoon). She took my name, room number, and said someone would bring up one to us. That was at about 11pm. No one brought any before we went to bed around 2am. And we had actually ran out, having to ask a room nearby (who we knew) us if they had any. Was still nothing brought to us by morning, so I'm assuming they just forgot about us. Luckily we knew a room nearby to ask, otherwise we would have had to use tissues or the paper towel we brought. 

Also, maybe it's changed, but we didn't remember having to pay so much for parking the last year we went (2019). I assumed it must have had parking for hotel guests included or something, as the gate every year had been open when we checked out and left. This year, was $36 (even though the only price I could find online said $10 a night, and we stayed 3 nights). So that was just an unexpected thing that we ran into.",Positive,,,,,
Make breakfast as part of the stay not charge for it,Positive,,,,,
"James was super nice and cheerful during check in and check out, and kept conversation the whole time even while waiting on the computer/system.  We ordered a rollaway bed that showed up immediately.  All the servers involved in breakfast were super nice and quick in their help.",Positive,,,,,
"The desk staff, security, housekeeping, and maintenance staff for the Hyatt were all friendly, helpful, and above and beyond what I've experienced before. Thank you so much!",Positive,,,,,
The food was a disaster. Insulting. $10 for a Ramen noodle cup to be poured into a different bowl to look made from the restaurant. Pork advertised on menu but 3 tiny shrimps were in there place instead. Chicken tenders the size of a pinkie finger and still wanting like $9. Total rip off and yes insulting.,Negative,,,,,
Love working with Christine and Tracy for our conference planning!,Positive,,,,,
The food in the restaurant took way to long.  Went in there twice and both times took an hour to get served.  Had to box food up due to meetings.  Also the meeting room are to far from the hotel rooms.  Our meetings were all upstairs. Needs escalators. 1 elevator for say about 1/2 in attendance which was 150 people using the elevators,Positive,,,,,
at the price we paid it was a good value stay but the property had a very dated feel,Positive,,,,,
"We have stayed at this facility many times and really liked it, that is why we came back. This time was a very disappointing stay.",Positive,,,,,
"The hotel was overbooked. I was upgraded it it wasn't an upgrade. Everyone got a suite and that was what I booked. The room I got was just a king room with one space a portable closet an d very disappointing appearance. I came for the American Legion Conference and it was not comfortable in my room, so I left a day early!",Positive,,,,,
There is a large rip in the left window drape on the upper edge.,Negative,,,,,
More parking spaces needed. Food choices were minimal. Rooms were more than we expected and very comfortable.,Positive,,,,,
"I registered early with the block of rooms at a rate of $119.?? Plus I believe 15.5% plus.
I called a 2nd time to get room close to elevator and handicap because lad",Positive,,,,,
The breakfast buffet was a joke kind of like the bare minimum of buffets with a high price tag,Positive,,,,,
For the size of our Convention they sorely lacked enough staff to cover everything in a timely manner. When we arrived our room was not ready until after 4pmhen we were told between 1 and 4. Friday the maid service was excellent she asked what we would like and  covered our needs. Saturday we had to go and ask for maid service and someone finally came while we were out to dinner so after 5pm. We left the hotel for food elsewhere as we couldn't afford the high costs. Other were late returning due to long wait times. For a Convention Center we are there to have meetings.,Positive,,,,,
"While I had minimal interactions with staff, all of my interactions were positive. The manager was extremely friendly, which mostly likely is a result of his US Marine Corps training. Thank you!",Positive,,,,,
"The only issue with your hotel, is that it doesn't have a supper club.  Our group is fairly old
and somewhat inconvenient to have to dine elsewhere.",Positive,,,,,
"This was probably one of the best hotels weâ€™ve ever stayed in! It was clean, beautiful, great staff, helpful and nice, pool was clean!",Positive,,,,,
"Cassiana, Toby, and Ebru (spelling?) did a great job in helping me.  My room was changed based on my needs and I really appreciated it.  Great job to all!!",Positive,,,,,
"Very expensive food & drink prices, slow beverage & food service",Positive,,,,,
Hyatt Regency is above my paygrade and the only reason for staying there was the American Legion Convention.,Positive,,,,,
"My only complaint was the recycle bins in the lobby and by the elevator.  Obviously, bins are too small for amount of cans that guests use since staff don't seem to empty them very often and they overflow thus recycle ends up in garbage.  On the second floor, the bins were full for 3 days with my cans before someone finally emptied them.  In a time where we are all asked to recycle as much as possible, this should be addressed.  Also I was surprised how many times the front desk staff were required to make coffee and bagels etc.. in The Market.  When the hotel is full, I think it would be a good idea to have that snack bar manned at all times during the day.  Front desk staff have enough work to do without having to prepare food.",Positive,,,,,
"The room needed major updating. The bathroom is extremely small and there is no exhaust fan which can lead to molding if the door isn't kept open. We were not informed that there was a $50/night ""incidental fee"" charged to the credit card. This would have been helpful to know upon check-in so I didn't have to call to find out why this extra charge appeared on my credit card. Very disappointed as this was not what we normally expect from the Hyatt.",Positive,,,,,
"I had to park in the City Parking ramp for one night, which was disappointing.",Negative,,,,,
Parking is a challenge. You need a larger lot.,Negative,,,,,
"The staff was excellent when dealing with the hotel.  The parking lot experience was very frustrating.  The complimentary parking cost me $36 to get out of the lot.  My room key didn't allow me to exit.  The line of cars behind me wanted to get out and the help button didn't get a response from anyone.  The response of the manager was that he couldn't do anything about it.  And then on Sunday morning, the gate was open and people could come and go free of charge.",Positive,,,,,
Room looked used and in need of an upgrade or remodel.,Positive,,,,,
I was so delighted by my experience.,Positive,,,,,
Overall a great experience,Positive,,,,,
"James at the front desk was awesome, very attentive, polite and accommodating! Made a great first-impression of the visit.",Positive,,,,,
Paid for parking and there was no spaces left when we returned for the night. Staff refunded the 10 bucks but would be nice to actually park at the hotel we are staying at.,Negative,,,,,
the breakfast was away covered priced,Neutral,,,,,
I thought the toilets in the hotel rooms were too low for me.  Hard to get up.,Negative,,,,,
"Ever day parking probably is not a problem, but when there is a convention there was certainly a parking problem.",Negative,,,,,
early morning there was no decaf coffee available done in coffee shop area,Positive,,,,,
Parking bad. Felt uncomfortable in off site parking. We had 2 walkers. Wanted to do off site eating and shopping to hard to even try. Check in gal helped us unload and cart to room as I had to get off site parking. We each needed to use our walkers to walk. Short staff for Handy Cap needs. My friend had not been to a Hotel for some time. ??? You Pubbs menu so small for choice.,Positive,,,,,
The service at the bar was terrible. Only 1 gentleman was good. It seeemed there were enough worker but they were running in circles.,Positive,,,,,
I paid a lot for the room and then they charge extra for parking my car in their parking lot. Didnâ€™t do that with previous stays!!!,Positive,,,,,
"I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay for a statewide convention of our organization.  I believe we blocked all of the hotel rooms for our use.  Customer service and condition of the hotel were excellent, however, the bar/restaurant was extremely under-staffed considering the number of guests in the hotel.",Positive,,,,,
"I had asked for a ""handicap accessible room"" ....but at check in none were available.  I booked the room in April for a July stay.  Not cool.",Positive,,,,,
"When I asked for contact information so we could order delivery pizza, the front desk handed me a brochure for one pizza company and said this is who we recommend.  After looking at it, I went back to the front desk and asked for any other information, and they handed me one additional--nothing from Pizza Hut, although there was a Pizza Hut only a mile away.  I had to google Pizza Hut, so I could place an order with them.",Positive,,,,,
"A convention as large as the American Legion was, couldâ€™ve possibly had a small lunch The area where breakfast was held, maybe hotdogs, Brats, chips beverages for a quick lunch.  Yes you had a hamburger in the pub, yes you had premade type sandwiches in that little cafÃ© but just didnâ€™t cut it .Also myself and I cannot tell you how many other people there were very disappointed with the seasoned potatoes at breakfast. They were so spicy people could not eat them. Maybe the chef shouldâ€™ve tried eating them.   The way your meeting rooms are set up, the walking seemed like forever. But the rooms and the staff were fantastic",Positive,,,,,
"My room faced the street, and it was extremely noisy! Loud motorcycles and trucks wth.
I understand under staffing, but that does not excuse losing my order for food, not once but twice.",Negative,,,,,
Tracy the Conference supervisor that I dealt with was AMAZING!,Positive,,,,,
Finding how to get into your facility was a nightmare.,Negative,,,,,
"Possibly some method for safer bath tub surface, less likely to slip.",Positive,,,,,
Three things: the center area of the hotel allows too much sound throughout the hotel. Second the free wifi was patchy because everyone on it.  Finally their was no information in the room about what to get for food ie at the hotel and around the hotel,Positive,,,,,
"There was one male with dark hair that worked the front desk that did not appear to want to be there. Any time a question was asked or he had to do something, there was a small sigh and almost an eye roll. Ex. When chocking l checking in I asked if I had put that I had my dog in the registration. He said, ""no"" in a quick and annoyed voice as he barely contained an eye roll as he walked over to get the form. 

Also there was a man that came to the room supposedly to fix a water leak but I never called for service. Not sure if it was a mistaken room, but they never should've entered when the door was opened by a child. I had stepped out of the room for a moment and my kids told me about this when I returned.",Negative,,,,,
"The room was beyond our expectations. The restaurant was highly over-priced, as were the items in The Market. $4 for a bottle of soda and $3 for bottled water or small bag of chips? Really? A 6-pack of soda can be purchased for $3-$4! A $16 per person breakfast buffet? No thanks. Those prices are simply gouging. We stayed at the hotel, as my husband is still recovering from a surgery. Not sure if we'd return to a parking spot and for less walking, the first night we ordered the Pub Burger. There isn't anywhere in our hometown that charges $18 for a burger and fries. The burger was tasty, but actually crunchy on the outside and neither of the orders of fries was hot, as should have been. They were barely warm and by the time we received the food, we have been there over an hour. We were given another order of fries AFTER finishing the burgers (a wait for those as well), but there was no adjustment on the bill. Poor PR. The waiter apologized, but none of that was his fault.",Positive,,,,,
"This was a convention for Wisconsin Legionnaires. The hotel is great as was the front desk and housekeeping.
 The food and beverage experience is one for the books. Totally unacceptable. Only one (1) bartender on any given shift, ran out of several name brands of beer, slow, almost nonexistent food service at any given time. At 21:15 Hrs. (9:15 PM) with 8 patrons in the ""Pub"", it took 22 min. to order a hamburger and 41 min. for it to be server very over cooked (Hocky puck). All that for a $12 six oz. cheese burger w/ fries. Lots of staff walking through and around the ""Pub"" at any given time. 
Good foodservice help must be hard to find in Green Bay.",Positive,,,,,
"Had a great stay. Forgot my phone charger at home, a desk staff person lent me his personal charger. Big thanks to him. Everyone was friendly and helpful.",Positive,,,,,
You need more food options on sight.,Negative,,,,,
"Staff was wonderful and very helpful.  I was given my room about 3 hours before the 4 o'clock check in time that was very helpful.  I can only hope that the Department of Wisconsin, American Legion will return to this hotel/convention center again soon.",Positive,,,,,
The food staff was overwhelmed on the rainy lunch day.  Some advance planning about how many people would be looking for a lunch would be helpful.  Maybe a buffet similar to breakfast buffet??,Positive,,,,,
Charging me for parking when I just spent $900+ at your hotel seems a little bit like a racket.,Positive,,,,,
Very nice!,Positive,,,,,
Staff very friendly.  Responded to our needs very quickly,Positive,,,,,
"This room is in the top 5 noisiest rooms I have ever stayed in. So noisy I couldn't sleep till after midnight. Terrible road noise.
I was pleased with the convention rooms and layout. I have gone to Legion StateConventions all over the state for 25 years. This(other than my room) was the best.",Positive,,,,,
CKECK IN WITH JEFFERY CHECK OUT WITH YOUN WOMAN,Neutral,,,,,
"1. parking lot was full and had to park across the street and pay
2. food in the restaurant wasnt very good
3. Buffet breakfast ""sucked""   eggs were cold, biscuits were little bricks, no bacon????
4. Elevators were incredibly slow.
5. Room was very nice.  Tub/Shower was very difficult to get in and out",Positive,,,,,
A good experience!,Positive,,,,,
"I wrote a letter, but it was very long, basically staff was very much unwilling to accommodate requests that were made months before with reservation, as well as other requests made. The young man that checked me in was unprofessional, I had requested in advance a higher floor, he told me the only rooms available were on the second floor.  Really, after 5:00p.m.on a Sunday? A young woman also behind the desk offered no assistance.  I was there to attend a convention, and a few hours later, others in our group were put on another floor.  It seems they were filling up one floor at a time, rather than look to see what else was available, making it easier for them, rather than helping customers.  Like I said, it's a long story, I would like to be contacted.  To make matters worse, upon checking out There were charges to my credit card from the restaurant I did not make!  On July 3, the night I checked in, I ate there, had a grilled cheese, (somewhere around $15.00) PAID CASH, and took it to my room. That was the only time I ate there.  At checkout on July 9, there was a charge of 50.65made on July 3, for dinner, and a charge on July 4 for 17.25 breakfast.  The only thing I charged at your hotel was the room-nothing else. The manager took it off my bill. The only person who would know my credit card number AND my room number would be someone behind your desk.  On the 6th I changed rooms, and there were no charges for the rest of my stay.  Could it be the young man who checked me in? I don't know his name, but he wore glasses, and  black fingernail polish.  He was not the one at the desk who later changed my room number, so he may not have known where I was.  Often our conventions are held at a Hyatt hotel, and have always had great service, but this was a totally different experience.",Positive,,,,,
"The breakfast buffet needs 100% upgraded.
Eggs were cold, more item needed, 

The coffee stand muffins were dry, egg breakfast sandwich was too dry",Positive,,,,,
The wait for food was greater than one hour. Nearly two hours. Too bad.,Negative,,,,,
$100 pet policy for one night is unacceptable. When booking through Expedia the pet fee is not up front and visible. You literally have to go looking for a pet policy. Then you check in and they tell you it will be another 100$. Unacceptable. The staff had no care in the world that this was no made apparent upon booking and just said sorry nothing we can do. If I wouldâ€™ve known there would be an extra 100$ for one night with a fog I wouldâ€™ve never booked this hotel.,Positive,,,,,
it would have been nice to have some sort of free or less expensive breakfast option. the breakfast was expensive otherwise,Positive,,,,,
The food and amazing service from the staff at Pub 333.  Summer was very attentive to all of us a group of 5-6 every night we visited she was awesome. Along with everyone else,Positive,,,,,
"This is the first Hotel in all my travels that did not have complimentary coffee in dining area. Also, our room did not have very many K cups and there was no creamer",Positive,,,,,
Your breakfast area seemed a very cold aura (probably the contemporary look),Positive,,,,,
"Parking lot was full. (Not hotelâ€™s fault, just FYI)",Positive,,,,,
Room 814 needs a bathtub mat. Bath was very slippery.,Positive,,,,,
Street side rooms VERY noisy.,Negative,,,,,

Larger rooms are great, but tired",Negative,,,,,
Room not supplied for limited housekeeping,Neutral,,,,,
The staff was exceptional and the hotel/room was very clean and laid out wonderfully. A very nice visit from beginning to end!,Positive,,,,,
Christina general manger was phenomenal in resolving an issue with my billing and date of stay. She is a keeper,Positive,,,,,
"I go to Door County for work several times a year. When I can't get a room closer, the Hyatt Regency in Green Bay is the only place I stay.",Positive,,,,,
"Our first room had long black on the bathroom floor.
The toilet had not been cleaned",Positive,,,,,
"Really missed clean sheets on daily basis
Getting clean towels was kinda stressful.",Negative,,,,,
The staff was GREAT!! Very Helpful and personable!!!!,Positive,,,,,
"We asked for no service twice, at online check in and then again in person. We got service on 4th day. My cell phone was moved and was leaning on a very expensive collectible. No harm, but very disappointing.",Negative,,,,,
Good visit.,Positive,,,,,
Our room was 833...the fan in the bathroom was loud all night.....that was the only problem.  We closed the door and it was ok but there should be a way to shut it off.  We did not have the air conditioner running.,Negative,,,,,
Great stay Staff amazing only think might want to check out the stability of the balcony in room 806 it was beautiful and we enjoyed it but tiles and balcony itself didnâ€™t seem stable structure wise but other then that everything was amazing!!!,Positive,,,,,
"Toilets too close to floor. Toilet seat was cheap uncomfortable plastic. Room cleaning was non-non-existent, possibly due to staff shortage.",Negative,,,,,
QUE HAGAN LA HABITACION DESPUES DEL CUARTO DIA NO ME PARECE MUY SERVICIAL,Neutral,,,,,
The Hyatt Regency Green  Bay may be the most amazing hotels I have ever stayed in. The rooms were perfect for us.,Positive,,,,,
"I had booked my room for a week. I was not a part of the Coke convention. We arrived late on the day of check in and our room was not done. I was not able to park in the hotel lot twice because it was full. Coke people were taking up two spots with a vehicle and a trailer. I had asked that we get an afternoon room service time so that we would be out of the room. The house keepers kept coming early and asking us if we needed anything. We wanted the full service. I asked for that at check in - for an afternoon service time. We ran out of things all the time; coffee, cups, toilet paper, clean towels, soap. I am a Hyatt member. The pool was great - loved the steam room and sauna. The front staff was kind. We did not eat at the restaurant or bar but we have in the past and it is good food and a fun atmosphere. It's fun to stay there and then walk downtown to enjoy a river walk or get good food and drinks.",Positive,,,,,
"My only complaint was the inadequate number of parking spaces for the number of rooms you have, I did not move my car the whole time I was there, because if I left there would be no space available upon my return. Desk clerk said if no spaces available go park in public lot for 85 cents an hour. That is a joke. If you donâ€™t have space for your guests Hyatt, not the guest , should foot the hill. Your hotelâ€™s handling of the parking situation was awful. Other than that, no other problems.",Negative,,,,,
the biggest problem was the lack of parking.  Two nights i had to park over at the Hampton Inn due to lack of parking at your hotel.  You need sufficient parking to accommodate your guests,Negative,,,,,
"Not enough parking for everyone.   Breakfast was limited, not ever hot, and",Negative,,,,,
Great place to stayâ€¦,Positive,,,,,
Called a week ahead for early checkin. Was told I could checkin at 3.  Upon my arrival was told no rooms were available.  But talked laterbto others that were all allowed to checkin early when they arrived after us and  hadnâ€™t called a week before to ask for early checkin.  Very upset about this.  Was forced to dress in a bathroom because we were not given a room at 3pm as previously promised.,Positive,,,,,
"The breakfast buffet option was awful.  For the cost, we would expect a similar experience to our previous stays.  The buffet only had eggs and bacon for protein, Picked over fruit and a toast station, French toast (marginal at best) grits and hash browns.  Gone were healthier options such as yogurt, granola, oatmeal, cereals, etcâ€¦. These options were moved to the gift shop to buy separately!!  For $22 for adults and $11 for kids, it was the worst breakfast experience we have ever had and we have been going here for years.",Positive,,,,,
"I would like to recognize the following people. Andrew, Tobi and Katherine at front desk. Chester,who was putting trash liners in cans by elevators, who stopped what he was doing to obtain me some supplies from staff linen closet. He could have referred me to maid services, but he didn't. 
I did have an issue with spider in my coffee mug and another type of bug on blanket, took bugs to Tobi, He told manager. But manager never got in touch with me. 
Another major issue is the short toilets, those are not standard height. They are way too short. Needs to be replaces. Also carpet in 614 has wrinkles. The people are great, and the room size and amenities are great. But toilet really need replaced.",Negative,,,,,
Staff and maintenance were very helpful.  Would stay again.,Positive,,,,,
Restaurant help was almost non existent. Most of my food came from your store. Banquet food was worst Iâ€™ve ever had in 41 banquets Iâ€™ve attended with my club. Nice hotel needs good food,Positive,,,,,
Please change the  toilets!!!!! They were so low one of our friends strained his back getting off of it.,Positive,,,,,
"Unfortunately our room was never cleaned during our entire 7 night stay. We were okay with it except our garbage was piling up and we had to bring a few things to the elevator garbage. 
Also the elevators were not working 100% correctly. We would push the up or down button and sometimes the elevator would go the opposite direction.",Negative,,,,,
Parking could have been better.,Positive,,,,,
"Put mats in the showers, almost slipped and fell numerous times.  They gave us one but should already ben in the rooms.  Dangerous for older folk.",Positive,,,,,
Bathroom toilet needs to be upgraded.  Market place products are way too expensive and not a lot of variety.  Elevators were very slow as well.,Positive,,,,,
Everyone was very nice and helpful. Breakfast buffet was wonderful.,Positive,,,,,
We hope to have the privilege of staying at the Hyatt Regency at Green Bay again!!  The room itself was very impressive!!,Positive,,,,,
It would be nice to have daily housekeeping although I understand it is Hyatt policy for housekeeping to be after 3 nights stay,Positive,,,,,
Ebru at the front desk was especially helpful and quick to respond to our needs.  (I may have misspelled her name),Positive,,,,,
"When we arrived on Friday night there were no luggage carts to be had anywhere!!!   We had to park in the lot across the street & carry 2 pieces of luggage, a small cooler, 2 small duffle bags and 3 kids across the skywalk, get into the elevator and go down to the hotel lobby and then another elevator to the 2nd floor to our room.  Unacceptable!!!!  It was my understanding that there was some sort of Coco Cola convention and those folks had all the carts, which left us &other guest with nothing!!  These types of situations, there should have been alternative methods for the convention goers to bring there belongs into the hotel.  I watch people come and go with load luggage carts multiple times.",Positive,,,,,
"It is very frustrating to pay $10 for parking but then not be able to use that parking lot. I understand that there can be overflow, but if we have to park in another lot across the street, the parking fee should be returned. Also, $22 seemed very expensive for breakfast. In addition to that, there were not many food choices and nothing there was actually hot.",Negative,,,,,
The people at the front desk where not very helpful when asked for directions anywhere.,Positive,,,,,
"Thought the overall experience was great, staff very helpful with check-in, directions and all of our questions.",Positive,,,,,
"The brunch was â€œunderwhelming â€œ, food cold, and high price. There was no option to order from menu",Positive,,,,,
"The breakfast buffet food was cold and dry. Suggest fresh warm food be served. Also, there was no free coffee available in the lobby for grab and go. It appears the hotel wants all customers to buy Starbucks coffee only.",Positive,,,,,
Parking was compromised and not enough for the patrons that are there it was that way the whole week with many vehicles blocking Isles,Negative,,,,,
Staff was great.,Positive,,,,,
"Overall the room was good.  Some of our towels were showing clear signs of wear!
One was thread bare and frayed.  The lounge part of our room could benefit from a deep carpet shampoo clean.  There was a big stain in front of the couch.",Positive,,,,,
"Room was very functional. The inside courtyard air felt "" heavy"" and worn. At times I felt like I was visiting a lesser rated hotel in Cairo or Leningrad.  Clean by their standards, but Green Bay Hyatt felt like this was an old place. Clean, but old.",Positive,,,,,
The front desk representative was rude as well as the barista from Starbucks i the morning.,Positive,,,,,
"It was pleasant, room was very nice. Parking can be a little bit of a problem.",Positive,,,,,
"Parking lot was overfilled--no where to park.  But I was not charged, so not a problem.",Negative,,,,,
Parking is a Big problem,Negative,,,,,
"I asked for a room on a high floor or with a patio. They didnâ€™t consider my request at all. 
I understand if it wasnâ€™t available but they didnâ€™t even say anything about not being able to accommodate my request. Just handed over the key and to my findings the view was the worst as I could see outside was just some rocks in terrace. The hotel and the room was really nice.",Positive,,,,,
"The parking lot was an absolute mess - vendors were parking in spots, taking up two or more spots at a time.  Staff did not seem to care.  The rooms seemed dated and the bathroom was gross.",Negative,,,,,
Breakfast was very bland and overpriced for what was offered.,Negative,,,,,
The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I would stay here again and would tell others too,Positive,,,,,
"Called ahead to ask if there was a fee for parking and told no but there absolutley was. Bathrooms small, could hardly close the door while inside.",Positive,,,,,
Our check in was not the best.  Not personable and got rooms that were right by elevator that I d at specifically asked to not have.  Luckily Andrew when I returned was working the desk and immediately resolved our issue and gave us the rooms we requested. Kudos to Andrew,Positive,,,,,
Parking filled up on site and even charged for water.,Neutral,,,,,
"The staff at the front desk and reception were very polite and helpful. The pool area was the best we have experienced. The dinner we had at the restaurant was perfect. The room was nice and clean. We were excited about having a balcony and planned to use it and enjoy the evening, but we were unable to use the balcony due to wasps nests and spider webs. The screen didn't close all the way so we couldn't leave that open either. Other than that, all went very well, and we will recommend the hotel to others.",Positive,,,,,
Very relaxing ðŸ˜Œ,Positive,,,,,
Electric vehicle destination charging on site would be very helpful,Positive,,,,,
A complimentary breakfast would have been nice.  $16 for an omelet is a little ridiculous. Other Hyatts that we have stayed at have served hot breakfasts. We recently stayed at an Embassy Suites in downtown Chicago and their complimentary hot breakfast was amazing.,Positive,,,,,
"The bartender at the hotel restaurant, Christian, was very attentive and friendly.  Excellent customer service!",Positive,,,,,
Toilet is too low.,Negative,,,,,

Parking situation is awful.  I would not stay again just because of that.,Negative,,,,,
Beds were not comfortable.,Positive,,,,,
See above comment,Positive,,,,,
Needed Continental breakfast.  Coffee available at a minimum,Positive,,,,,
Multiple groups of children in the pool and hot tub after 10pm with no parents. Screaming and yelling. There was zero enforcement of any rules or policies in the pool area. It was far from relaxing.,Negative,,,,,
James and Tobi and the rest of the Staff are AWESOME,Positive,,,,,
The programming on the elevators needs to be adjusted.  FAR too slow and non-intuitive response and routing for various requests to and from floors.,Negative,,,,,
Had a water leak in a room above me and staff quickly helped me move to another room with an upgrade.,Positive,,,,,
Did not know we needed to ask for room service,Neutral,,,,,
Limited food menu from the Pup. Disappointed with selections.,Negative,,,,,
I'm pretty low maintenance customer.  The breakfast was way too expensive for being a pretty average meal.  Orange juice for $4?  Seriously?,Positive,,,,,
"We are disappointed that you do not offer complimentary breakfast any longer.  You also used to offer a free happy hour drink ticket for the bar, but no longer.  And we were not expecting to be charged for parking.",Positive,,,,,
Very disappointed with breakfast menu. One of my grandchild had gluten allergy and the restaurant did not offer any gluten free items.,Negative,,,,,
The hotel and room were very clean. All of the staff was very friendly. I would come back.,Positive,,,,,
Replace Toilets,Positive,,,,,
You need to install higher elongated toilets,Neutral,,,,,
When in the restaurant a whole table should be served at the same time or atleast the kids meals should come first but for us that was not the case 2 at our table were done eating before our food came and kids steak was way under cooked.,Positive,,,,,
The hotel was clean and the staff were very helpful.  The rooms are dated and clearly reflect the need for a facility-wide rehab.  (e.g. peeling paint in the bathroom),Positive,,,,,
Staff were great!  Stayed there and attended a conference on site.  Everything was really good.,Positive,,,,,
"Breakfast experience was disappointing. One day the service was great the next we sat and waited both for our order to be taken and then for it to be served for an hour. Manager comped the breakfast. No complaint with the quality of the food, very good.",Positive,,,,,
"Room was clean and well kept.  Bathroom was quite small.  Four days for room cleaning is a bit much, maybe every other day would be better.  Saturday breakfast was excellent, but service was very slow. Dinners were both excellent and prompt. Overall great stay.",Positive,,,,,
There was a loud compressor runner and that made it hard to get to sleep,Negative,,,,,
The blonde girl at front desk was so helpful.  She made me an iced coffee after closing. Great customer service here!,Positive,,,,,
"I realize you do not provide any services for people who are staying but just bringing clean towels, washcloths, etc every day would be nice.  Why do you have to call down to the desk and ask for more.",Positive,,,,,
"Total mess every time we called on reservations. Were not at all helpful with finding a room
so another group would not have to move twice. Breakfast waitress messed up the the orders. Bar kept running out of Busch, poorly managed & SLOW. Hotel is very nice, been there many times. Disappointing this trip.",Negative,,,,,
"Pretty disappointed that I had to call every day to get coffee, soap etc.",Negative,,,,,
The bed was to high and also seemed like the mattress at your feet was higher than your head.,Positive,,,,,

Could not connect to internet when in conference center meeting rooms,Positive,,,,,
"All of the the front desk people I spoke to, on the phone and in person, were very helpful and friendly",Positive,,,,,
I would like to see newer toilets. The one i had in my room is way to low for me,Positive,,,,,
I understand that itâ€™s very hard to find help these days however some of the staff That were servers in the breakfast area obviously did not want to be there on a scale of 1 to 10 as far as customer service they wouldnâ€™t even get a one,Positive,,,,,
The sliding glass door in my room had some kind of slime on it.  Looked like it hadnâ€™t been cleaned in a long time.  The coffee shop / convenience store didnâ€™t open until 8:00 am. Coffee shops should open much earlier than that.  The breakfast at the 333 was very poor.  Other than the sliding glass door the room was very nice.,Positive,,,,,
Room service would be nice,Neutral,,,,,
"This Hyatt needs a bit of a renovation.  When we booked our reservation, we were upgraded to a room but it was less than Hyatt's standard.  The carpet was buckling and there was dirt on the ceiling.  When we complained to our Hyatt concierge, she called the front desk and they moved us to a much better room. We were very pleased when the manager showed up at our door with a bottle of champagne and a card signed by the staff for our anniversary.  They more than made up for our inconvenience.  Definitely a great location, but as I said, the hotel could use a bit of a renovation.",Positive,,,,,
Wish the room toilets were bigger and adult sized.,Positive,,,,,
Service in Pub took forever. We were told there would be a 30-35 minute wait for food and it was almost 1 hour. Requested check to pay and it took over 10 minutes to receive it.,Positive,,,,,
Had an incredible experience.  Will stay again!,Positive,,,,,
Elevators slow and not always working.,Positive,,,,,
As a globalist I thought the gratuity was included on my breakfast. I was charged for gratuity.,Positive,,,,,
Maybe put in higher toilets. Felt like it was the perfect height for a 4 year old!,Positive,,,,,
breakfast over priced,Positive,,,,,
"I was disappointed when I found out there was a charge for checking in before 3pm. I received an email saying my room was ready, but when we arrived we were told it was an extra $25. The room was ready anyway, so why am I being charged? I was really not happy about that and told nothing could be done.",Positive,,,,,
"I just got over 2 major life threatening cancer surgeries.  I am a Global Status, yet was not able to get my free breakfast due to my low immune system & Covid going on.  Can I get extra points on my account for saving the hotel around $150-200 in breakfast bill?  I may need to stay at the Hyatt House in MN by Mayo Clinic for more medical & that would  help me out a bunch, since I do not have a lot of money.",Positive,,,,,
We stayed at this location due to my mother-in-law entering hospice and then passing away.  Some  of the hotel staff were aware of this and were very kind to us and helpful.  We would like to thank the following for exceptional service:  Erin-Front Desk; Andrew-Manager? and James-Customer Relations.  All three of these people strove to help us and were lovely to work with.,Positive,,,,,
Everything was great,Positive,,,,,
"Maybe limit the amount of occupancy in the pool room, it was way overcrowded and not enough clean towels for everyone. Also the pool had a lot of chemicals and caused eye irritation.",Negative,,,,,
"I booked through American Express and the parking fee was not listed, cribs was not in the room as requested. The crib is too deep for a young baby and they should not allow me to get additional mattresses to keep the baby higher.",Positive,,,,,
All my comments and experience were noted previous comment section.,Positive,,,,,
"Staff was great.  Even though short staffed, spirits were high.  Hire more people and keep the ones you have.",Positive,,,,,
Parking was a problem,Negative,,,,,
having trouble getting a receipt from the booking agency (getaroom.com).  Wish you could get one for me.,Positive,,,,,
"Each time I interacted with a staff member I was met with a smile, a hello and if needed helping me above and beyond.",Positive,,,,,
This is my favorite hotel yet!!!,Positive,,,,,
Would be a good investment to have small noise machines or fans available as the traffic from Main St is harrowingly loud! We could not stay asleep for longer than 15 mins before a rush of Indy 500 sounding cars wizzed past .,Positive,,,,,
"Web site misrepresented the room we were put into as a ""Corner room"". The motel staff was unable to move us to a real ""corner room"". They did give us a food and beverage credit to compensate, which helped. It was Our 45th wedding anniversary weekend and I booked a ""corner room"" because we like the quietness of being in a remote corner. The Hotel was unable or unwilling (?) to relocate us into the type of room we booked and tried to tell us we were in the right type (as booked) We were not in a corner room, we were in a ""Next to Corner Room"". They told us they would contact the department that handles the room descriptions on the website but I cannot help but notice that the sight still is misrepresenting it.",Positive,,,,,
Your staff has always been impeccable!! I love staying here.,Positive,,,,,
Unfortunately all food experience were far below expectation.,Negative,,,,,
Ehru was terrific,Positive,,,,,
I did mention the cold shower after day 1  it never heard what the issue was. Likely the fact that the conference was going on with lots of people showering at the same time. If engineering checked in the afternoon it was probably fine. Heard other people from our conference state they had cold showers.,Negative,,,,,
Stayed Friday to Tuesday no cleaning. Pretty disappointing when we recently stayed at Hyatt in Florida and had service. Hotel was also super expensive with lots of issue in room,Positive,,,,,
"I reserved a corner room through the app, which was one of the more expensive rooms.  When i checked in at the desk, I asked if my room would be facing the river at all, and was told no.  I said i would take a lesser room if it was facing the water.  They did give me a different room, that was less expensive.  when i asked if i would then get the lower rate, I was told no.  Apparently since they ""accommodated me"".  That was frustrating.",Negative,,,,,
"Carpet in room was wrinkled, showing its age, getting closer to being a trip hazard.",Negative,,,,,
"overall it was a great experience and as far as future travel, Hyatt hotels will be where I choose to stay",Positive,,,,,
We were expecting something nicer. The age of the building is just too old. the stairwells are ridiculous. The elevators are so slow and small that we prefer the stairs but they were really awful! It's time for a major renovation.,Positive,,,,,
"We had a delay in arriving because of travel difficulties, and arrived after midnight, but Jesse made us cups of tea to help us transition to settling in. He was exceptional.",Negative,,,,,
Grab and Go lunches were terrible.,Negative,,,,,
"Attempted  a conference of approx 250.  In 3 attempts to have billing for room corrected, it is still wrong.  Simple issue of tax exempt status has been completely confused.

No longer worth the effort and frustration for a simple issue

Not at all likely to stay again",Negative,,,,,
check in process needs improvement.,Positive,,,,,
The validated parking is much appreciated.,Positive,,,,,
Everything and everyone was great. Just wish that the fridge worked and the thermostat worked properly.,Positive,,,,,
The staff was great.,Positive,,,,,
Tobi is awesome,Positive,,,,,
"Fitness Center was awesome! The balcony was too small, barely enough room with the patio furniture.",Positive,,,,,
â€œAs expectedâ€ the performance BUT I have VERY high expectations at Hyatt and yâ€™all always deliver so thatâ€™s an excellent commentary! Thank You!,Positive,,,,,
Liked the room set up.  Hated the parking!!  Not enough surface parking for guests.  Very confusing that we had to go across the street.  Thank goodness it was free after 6 pm on Friday and I get my parking fee refunded.  But I had to pursue that,Positive,,,,,
All good as always. Thank you!,Positive,,,,,
No warm welcome.. very robot like.. no friendliness,Positive,,,,,
Would've been nice to offer in-room safes,Positive,,,,,
"No real check in process, waited for 10 minutes before realizing I can get digital key. Front desk was not responsive to people standing in line.",Positive,,,,,
All staff were extremely helpful and it felt like they went above and beyond. Requests from housekeeping were very prompt.,Positive,,,,,
"As there is a kitchen, it would be helpful to have paper towels available.",Positive,,,,,
"I was there for a conference. Was happy with the conference rate. 
Getting the reservation was a struggle. The third party lost my reservation and I had to scramble to get one. The ""on line"" process was awful. I couldn't get to a real person (none of the ""punch this"" list pertained to my problem. Eventually, I finally got the phone number of your green bay hotel and was able to secure a reservation. It took way too much time to accomplish and was stressful to the other people in my party.
I would avoid third party in the future.",Positive,,,,,
"For breakfast, the waittress never came back to see if I wanted more coffee, needed to ask for a spoon because these weren't wrapped up with the fork and knife

I only had one other meal, for the banquet.  The food was good, but meat was tough to cut.  No spoons were in the napkins and there was no coffee pot on our table.",Positive,,,,,
"The food was cold most of the time.  There were not enough servers for the banquet.  I was done before the table in front had been served.  I was expecting a high end stay, and did not experience high end at all.",Positive,,,,,
The heat wasnâ€™t working all three nights. I left the hotel sick.,Negative,,,,,
"There was no carts available for check in and no parking either, so we had to park across the street and carry our belongings. There were long waits at the elevator.  Breakfast was said to be included, but I was billed nearly $80.",Positive,,,,,
We stayed 3 days and our room was cleaned 0 times even though we requested cleaning,Positive,,,,,
"the Food and Beverage staff seemed more interested in standing around and chatting with each other than being concerned with the dining guests. The food was sub-par for what I have expected from, and received in most of the Hyatt properties I have stayed.",Positive,,,,,
"Sadly, we would not stay at this location again due to the parking. Was awful. We also joined a Hyatt club Offered by the check in staff to reduce the cost of parking during our stay by half and yet still got overcharged on our final bill and as of today, four days later are still trying to get overcharge squared away because no one seems to know how to take care of the situation. Also, it was a surprise.and a disappointment that some kind of breakfast was not includedâ€¦But mostly itâ€™s because of the parking situation..too much hassle sadly for such a nice hotel.",Positive,,,,,
Ran out of parking spots in the middle of a rainstorm. Staff were kind to us and let us park our midsize SUV in compact car spot.,Positive,,,,,
Parking is a problem and providing information on what to do when the lot is full before you actually have the problem would be better.,Positive,,,,,
I expected friendly professional service and that's what I got.  All was good.  The only thing I struggled with was the strange stairways.  I was on third floor and took the stairs a lot but they were sometimes hard to follow until I'd been up and down a few times.,Positive,,,,,
Prompt attention to a request I had by the front desk,Positive,,,,,
Would be nice to have breakfast included,Positive,,,,,
"Staff and service were very nice.  Great beds!  Room was very nice, but lighting is on the dark side.  Would be nice to have brighter lighting or better reading lights in the 'living room' space.",Positive,,,,,
We love it here!,Positive,,,,,
great job,Positive,,,,,
Very comfortable and clean.,Positive,,,,,
Having to pay for parking when there is not enough space for hotel guests is not right.  No maid service shows that customer service is not important.  Quality of food was poor and overpriced.,Positive,,,,,
"The breakfast waiter needs more training. Not sensitive to customersâ€™ need. Slow service. 
When we sat down, no water serve at all. Ordered coffee, it took a while to come and no sugar or cream offered until asked for it. Asked for paper napkin but he totally forgot about it.
He asked if he can take my plate away even before I finished my food.
He took away the payment slip even 
though we were still sitting there.",Positive,,,,,
please state all fees when checking in.,Positive,,,,,
"The carpet had a big loose spot that made you trip.
The patio was full of cobwebs and large spiders (a quick broom before we arrived would have been sufficient)
Water was not hot and water pressure was low.  

Having stayed at Hyatts before, I was a little disappointed but it was fine.

Also parking was a hassle.",Negative,,,,,
Those parking lot mechanical barricades are a pain in the assâ€¦,Negative,,,,,
"The steam, sauna and indoor pool area were well appointed and a great daytime activity while staying at the hotel. The young lady working the Starbucks/breakfast counter was very helpful and went above and beyond to ask about my stay and plans in Green Bay. I was also impressed by the young man bartending on Wednesday night (dark hair, newer employee), he was extremely fast in serving us and was helpful with recommendations in Green Bay.",Positive,,,,,
Great space,Positive,,,,,
Perfect,Positive,,,,,
Toilets very very low.,Neutral,,,,,
"I admit, I stayed here a handful of times in the last 20 years- it used to have an awesome Sunday buffet, and breakfast was included.  It appears more geared to business travel than family getaway.  I travel a bit for business, and it is perfect for that. This was a quick 2 night stay with my 6 year old- included breakfast would have been great.  Not happy to pay for parking in a market like Green Bay.  But the hotel, staff, service was great.",Positive,,,,,
"I was in town for my daughters wedding. James at the front desk was incredibly helpful. He helped with early check in, contacted me on my cell and continued to check how things were going. He helped make an extremely stressful time so much easier.",Positive,,,,,
Absolutely love that microwaves are available in rooms!,Positive,,,,,
Thought bathroom was a little small.  Fan was not working and shower did not drain.,Positive,,,,,
"FYI, toilet in room kept running, could only hear it if I was in the bathroom, just for water conservation sake. The food choices were quite great, but prices were astronomical. Seroogys bars sell for $1.50 for fundraisers, and they're being sold for $3 with not being a fundraiser. Tiny bag chips for $2.50. I only stayed because the event I was attending was in the KI center. Hotel was very nice, but every little thing is charged. Charging guests $10/night for parking is not good customer service.",Positive,,,,,
"The property is well located in Green Bay.  We had a family emergency and had to leave within a few hours.  Staff was amazing to help us get on the road.  James, thank you for the referral where to eat for lunch -The Depot.  And for everything else.  Will definitely come back!",Positive,,,,,
Disappointed in parking lot and non working kiosk as you entered and left the lot. Was also suprised a free night award did not include parking.Staff and hotel have always been great but parking lot efficiency has also always been an issue.,Positive,,,,,
"we were lucky to stay in the executive suite,my favorite room. the room is large, comfortable, quite. extras have been added to the room including snacks, sodas, and wine. also has more of a wisconsin feel with various prairie grasses for decoration. the breakfast is always one of the many reasons we keep coming back here.",Positive,,,,,
Staff were all great.,Negative,,,,,
Grab bars in the shower would be appreciated by all senior guests like us.,Positive,,,,,
"The corner room was very spacious, and the location was great.  We very much enjoyed our 1-night stay.",Positive,,,,,
"The check-in experience was lovely - very helpful, friendly, and extra thankful of our Hyatt status",Positive,,,,,
Pub 333â€™s customer service was amazing! Staff went above and beyond to meet our unique requests!,Positive,,,,,
This was the armpit of hyatts.,Positive,,,,,
"The only complaint was the street noise.  Doubt thereâ€™s is any TV unt that can be done, other than a Green Bay police officer being stationed outside the hotel.  But, the noise was insane and went on until 3:00 AM",Negative,,,,,
I was the Godmother of the bride and wedding decorator and the staff refused to give me the bridal discount for room rate.  Had to pay for parking every night and had to park across the street because the lots were full.,Positive,,,,,
You should advertise that the rooms have a door between the sleeping area and kitchen/lounge area. Parents would book with you specifically for that feature! We donâ€™t always want to go to bed when our kids do.,Neutral,,,,,
I would suggest putting the guest next door to us with the barking dog and screaming (no exaggeration) child be put on the â€œweâ€™re bookedâ€ list.,Positive,,,,,
"If the ""fix"" is a box fan and a non-functional HVAC system in the room, the person should probably just be moved to a different room that works.",Negative,,,,,
"At check in I stated that I was bed type agnostic, my only request is a room with a bathroom larger than a closet. Victoria either ignored this request or such rooms do not exist.

Saturday night the street racing on Main Street kept me awake much longer than I desired. Not within hotel control and Jesse handled my midnight complaint well. Additional soundproofing on the windows would be welcomed. 

I have serious feedback on the food and beverage program. Firstly, remove ""poutine"" from the menu. You may think you have the ingredients to make it but you don't. Secondly there are 4 craft beers on tap, New Glarus and 3 IPAs, at least one of which is also available in cans. Variety is good.

Breakfast coffee service needs to be rethought. There is not sufficient staffing to provide timely refills on the 8 ounce mugs. Larger mugs or provide a carafe per table. Also the creamer/sweetener bowls are lacking. My Sunday morning coffee came with two creamer pods and no more than 3 of any type of sweetener. This barely covered a single cup which is all I consumed during the meal, see above on coffee issues. Fixed sweetener selection on all tables would take another 10 minutes to setup/tear down daily but would allow the bowl to filled completely with creamer pods. 

I attempted to address some of these concerns at checkout as there was no line behind me. The female clerk seemed more interested in staring into space than attempting empathy.",Positive,,,,,
Free the parking.. all the times I've stayed in the last 30+ years I've never paid to park for a hotel I'm staying at..,Negative,,,,,
"The rooms are very dark, it was hard putting makeup on",Negative,,,,,
Paying for parking was unexpected but not unreasonable,Negative,,,,,
The draft beer in the bar was skunky.  Probably would be fixed by cleaning the tap lines. Otherwise great stay and it's a really cool building.,Positive,,,,,
We were in GB to attend a wedding. Room was clean and comfortable. Restaurant was good. Staff was very nice.,Positive,,,,,
Only problem was bathroom was. Very small,Negative,,,,,
Not enough parking spaces.,Negative,,,,,
There wasnâ€™t free parking or free breakfast. If I wouldâ€™ve known this I wouldâ€™ve never stayed here! Really disappointing. Pool was great though & hot tub.,Negative,,,,,
Great experience,Positive,,,,,
Alarm clock was set by previous guests and woke me at 6 a.m. Hotel structure is beautiful.,Positive,,,,,
Very happy!,Positive,,,,,
We were charged $10 for parking.   We left the hotel for  a few hours and when we tried to return the parking lot was full due to a wedding.  We had to park on the street and ended up with a $32 parking ticket.  Would be nice if the $10 might be refunded.  Was very happy with flexibility in letting us check in at 3pm instead of 4pm.,Positive,,,,,
We were there for our daughter's wedding.   Everything was great! Thank you.,Positive,,,,,
"James greeted us like family. He was very kind, warm and welcoming both on the phone and upon arriving. Rooms were spacious and clean. Staff were very professional and helpful. Great stay!",Positive,,,,,
I requested a quiet room and instead was placed right outside the elevator. All night my kids woke up to the constant dinging.,Positive,,,,,
The front desk people were really great.  They gave us an excellent dinner recommendation and were very helpful.  Early in the morning the front desk person even got me some coffee. They were fantastic!,Positive,,,,,
"I don't remember the name of the lady who was cleaning the 6th floor rooms on the afternoon of Sat. May 21, but she was super nice and graciously provided us with 2 extra coffee pods and cups so that we could have coffee that afternoon. The early morning desk staff were also SUPER getting us coffee very early in the morning",Positive,,,,,
NEED BETTER PARKING,Positive,,,,,
"The food was not very good.  We had a corporate conference for two days, and none of the food was very good, and options were very limited.",Positive,,,,,
Very disappointed to be charged for parking. We have stayed here before and have never been charged. In the future we will look for a different hotel that does not charge parking. It was not on the first page of the website and that was not stated during check in. My son and his family also stayed there two nights and was also surprised by the charge for parking.,Negative,,,,,
"Our favorite place to stay in Green Bay.  Weâ€™ve come to expect the clean rooms, helpful, friendly staff and frequently use the on site restaurant/bar.",Positive,,,,,
Your rooms need at least a soft goods update - they are very dated.,Positive,,,,,
Breakfast was very tasty and perfectly prepared service was great. Check in was fast and easy and I got available upgrade was greeted as a Globalist. Room was spotless and very clean.,Positive,,,,,
"New guy bartender was on his 2nd night, he was one of the nicest people I've come across in a long time! Great addition to your staff!",Positive,,,,,
"Please change the thermostats so we can control them. Also, what are those loud noises in the atrium elevator on the 8th floor , it sounded like an alarm but I think it was a ventilation system. It was horribly loud.",Neutral,,,,,
"Great facility, Friendly personnel, very nice Room.",Positive,,,,,
"This property is showing it's age. Lots of scuffs, dings, peeling paint on doors and walls. Rooms also showing age with outdated furniture. Coffee maker in room is poor as is coffee quality. Elevators are bizarrely slow.",Negative,,,,,
"Two employees really impressed us. Melody (housekeeping I think) and Mitch (maintenance) were very helpful 
and pleasant.",Positive,,,,,
"As a tea drinker, single-cup coffee makers put really gross, burned coffee taste into boiling water. I would love a ceramic mug, so I could just microwave the water and put my tea bag in. A plain kettle (not a pod coffee maker) would also work.",Positive,,,,,
"Thursday morning I was told unapologetically that there was no coffee at the Starbucks food market. It was 5:45am. That is inexcusable considering how important morning coffee can be to business travelers. The fellow at the desk didn't seem at all fazed by my surprise and offered no reason for there being no coffee available. 
Other than that, stay was ok. However additionally, the toilet paper is recycled cheap stuff and should be a little better. 
I did not discover there was one box of Kleenex in the room until the last day because it was hiding on the shelf under the night table. 
Desk chair had a stain on it. Was unfortunate that I had to use a dirty chair.",Positive,,,,,
My room did not have a hair dryer- but the over all stay was very nice,Positive,,,,,

"Great hotel, room really spacious and clean. Staff very helpful would highly recommend.",Positive,,,,,
The only negative experience we had was during breakfast in the atrium. The service was exceedingly slow and I was overcharged on items.,Positive,,,,,
It would be nice for express checkout if you put in the email where to put the keys  I left them in the room instead of in the Dropbox and the person working was slightly rude about it,Positive,,,,,

"Tobi at the front desk was amazing, professional, and super friendly! He was very helpful and had lots of knowledge in the surrounding areaâ€™s restaurants. He was also very speedy when it came to requests and helped out with any info that we needed. Please give this man a raise if you havenâ€™t considered it yet! The room was lovely and very spacious. The view was fantastic and the bathroom was amazing. Thank you for the lovely stay!",Positive,,,,,
"When I attempted to check out, no one was at the desk but there was a key drop off.  I never received an email copy of my bill.  When I went on-line to get a copy of my bill, the charges were incorrect.  After making a number of calls to correct the bill, I was left on hold for an extended period of time.  This stay was very unHyatt like.",Positive,,,,,
Expensive snacks and beverages. For cost of room should include breakfast. Clean and modern room. Friendly and helpful staff.,Positive,,,,,
"I cannot remember all of the staff's names that helped me... I think his name was Michael? He was at the Front Desk when I checked in with dark square glasses, he was wonderful and very welcoming! The gentleman at night was also extremely nice! The next morning while I was working out, my ankle started to hurt so I went to the front desk and the young lady up there was AMAZING! She got me a bag of ice and tied it off with her own hair tie and then helped me get an iced coffee. She didn't have a name tag on, but she was blonde, wore all black, and had a cross necklace. She said she had only started in February, but I told her that she needs to always stay in hospitality! I have worked in hospitality my whole life and she is exactly what Front Desks are always looking for... happy, caring, and finding ways to go above and beyond for your guests. 
The room was spacious, clean, and very comfortable! 
Your banquet staff was great as well!
I came up for the MPI event, and you have now gotten a forever guest out of me, my family, and I will be letting everyone know to stay with you when they're traveling to Green Bay!",Positive,,,,,
"Room furniture a little tired. Great location, friendly staff",Positive,,,,,

Great staff and security. Helpful friendly and amazing,Positive,,,,,
In the restaurant I would have liked to seen paper menus instead of using my phone. I understand becouse of covid. It is easier to look at a paper menus then at it though my phone. what if I sent my daughter who does not have a phone to go get breakfast or food? cant always think everyone has a phone. It should be gaving a option if I want a paper copy or not. thank you.,Positive,,,,,
Very uncomfortable king mattress.  Also very high off the floor.  Too high for a short person to crawl into bed,Negative,,,,,
I didn't see any where that there was a breakfast service. (No I did not ask)  I saw the market that you could buy items but not a breakfast that was included with the stay.  Restaurant was understaffed but understand that is current economy.  The staff that worked was very friendly and did a wonderful job.  I will definitely stay again.,Positive,,,,,
Hotel looked tired. Carpet was lifting up in the middle of room,Negative,,,,,

"The overall room was great but my disabled, 25-year-old veteran had some issues with the tightness of the bathroom and with how low the toilet was.  We weren't expecting it to be so low and he struggled a bit because of that as he had some major accidents/injuries affecting his entire left side, especially his back and leg. The pool and hot tub were great! There were a lot of kids roughhousing pretty badly though in the pool...throwing each other around, pushing each other, splashing, and getting into other peoples' space. We ended up leaving the area after it became too much. Food options were few which was a bummer. Breakfast definitely tasted nice but there was an issue of having to ask for water a couple of different times as no one was bringing it out.  Paying for parking also wasn't ideal since the room itself had a decent price tag and the lot was so small. It would've been nice to have the fee waived somehow.  The staff seemed nice. I believe it was a manager who went above and beyond for my boyfriend and me in the marketplace area. (His name may have been Andrew?).",Positive,,,,,
Parking at your place is not great.,Positive,,,,,
"Wonderful staff, very welcoming & accommodating!",Positive,,,,,
Trying to get a breakfast sandwich for a hungry child was horrible. Two people need to be in the Market/Starbucks Restaurant at ALL times. One girl was there both mornings all by herself. One other person would come and go and never helped. I stood in line both mornings I was there for 1/2 hour to 40 minutes. That's just crazy!,Positive,,,,,

breakfast is far too expensive. rooms should have disposable plates and disposable eating utensils.,Positive,,,,,
"Signed up for loyalty program to get cheaper parking (didnâ€™t expect to pay for parking), but didnâ€™t get details.  Brwakfast order totally screwed up.",Negative,,,,,
Parking lot was full ....we had to use overflow parking structure. A little inconvenient..Also..you could use more carts for when people check in. There seemed to be a dearth of them.,Positive,,,,,

Bar tender was very nice and kept us with drinks but her outside friends were very annoying and seemed to be drinking for free.,Positive,,,,,

Front desk was exceptional. She was helpful and fast. The restaurant on the other hand was the complete opposite. Bartender/wait staff acted more upset we were even there than anything (we were there at 6:30pm),Positive,,,,,

More handicapped spots would be a welcome addition to your surface lot. It is a long walk from the parking structure when you are handicapped.,Positive,,,,,
The towels could be updated.  I have actually never seen one that short.  Taller would be a big plus,Positive,,,,,
Andrew was absolutely fantastic. He was friendly and very helpful. I have never stayed at a hotel where an employee stood out so much that I wanted to write a review just for them.,Positive,,,,,
When staying we experienced some ants in the bathroom which was brought to the attention of the manager James Pritchett who quickly took take of the problem by moving us to a new room. He was very kind and concern for my feelings. It was nice to be treated like a person with a problem even though it was a little problem. When we checked out he was very nice and remembered us. That was very sweet so thank you for the experience. I will be up there next year for the same conference and will be looking forward to staying at your Hotel,Positive,,,,,
I had a reservation at a different hotel and they couldn't find it. Hyatt had availability at 11:00 p.m. and I was able to check-in. The person checking me in was very friendly and accommodating. He made a stressful situation instantly disappear with his smile and quickness at getting me to a room. I will be making reservations at the Hyatt instead of the other hotel moving forward.,Positive,,,,,

"I expected a similar experience here to the one I had at the Hyatt in Milwaukee. The beds were different and stiff, the pillows were uncomfortable. Parking said it cost $10 and then when we went to pay, it was $12. Breakfast was sit-down and not continental as expected.",Negative,,,,,
"Staff were busy, waits were long, interactions were short",Neutral,,,,,
We love the Hyatt in Green Bay and stay there often. I did feel a little duped by checking in online...I was offered an upgrade for $150 and was paying $130 a night so we decided to go for it thinking it was an extra $60 for the 3 nights stay. It was an additional $150 on top of my regular room rate so I spent more than double for the upgrade and although the room was delightful I didn't feel that was advertised well when checking in online. I would have never made the upgrade if it was. It probably said something in fine print but that didn't necessarily come thru on my phone screen while checking in. So i probably won't use the online check in for the future. The younger security guard was very poor at his job but luckily Andrew was working the front desk for most of our stay and was amazing at dealing with things as they came up and keeping everyone happy. Currently broke from the upcharge but still love this Hyatt! See you next season!!!,Positive,,,,,
Fan in room ran all of the time and we could not get it to shut off.,Neutral,,,,,
"The menu was ""updated"".    I ended up paying around $35 for Breakfast.   I ordered the same breakfast veggie omlette, english muffin ($4.00!!) and ice tea ($4.00) and sub fruit ($2.00).   Understand costs have gone up but this seems really excessive.   Also it took over 20 mins to get my food to the table.   There was not alot of people eating. 

I really enjoy staying here but this is making me rethink my stays.   When I stay at the Hilton Garden Inn the cost was less than $20 and the service was much faster.",Positive,,,,,
Andrew at the front desk was great and went above and beyond to help with any needs or concerns I had,Negative,,,,,
"The young security officer was very rude when telling people it was time to clear the atrium area on Saturday evening.  He was very much on a power trip.  Another party asked why, and he did not answer reasonably, he more or less was rude and just overused his authority.  Kindness does go a long way.  My husband is a police officer and it is unfortunate how your security officer treated people, as that is not the norm for most law enforcement officers and to ignorant people might portray real Law Enforcement in a bad light.  In the end that influences our feelings of the Hyatt overall.  I can see him being more firm and annoyed if it would have been a  2nd warning or if people were refusing to listen. Also, if your atrium closes at a specific time, please just post a couple signs or have it in the sheet we received for our stay When we checked in.  People will abide to it.

I did have the privilege of talking to an older long haired blonde housekeeper who was very kind and cheerful about the time of our departure.  I really enjoyed her customer service and cheerfulness.",Positive,,,,,

Seem like this is a nickle and dime you hotel.  Charged me 25 dollars to enter room a little early despite hotel being deserted.  Charged 10/day for parking despite parking not really an issue.  Pain in the next to pay everytime I left - only to learn upon checking out that there was a way to minimize that.,Negative,,,,,
Breakfast too costly. Liked the breakfast buffet in the past.,Positive,,,,,
Always a great place to stay. Have stayed here several times.,Positive,,,,,
restaurant service was very slow.  Bartender could not make mixed drink - perhaps she should have been waitressing instead.,Negative,,,,,
The security team was outstanding.,Positive,,,,,
"Really good hotel and very welcoming stuff. The only thing that I didn't enjoy from,  was the breakfast.  Not that food is not good.  A person when come eating in the morning he would like to choose from a variety of food components and decide by himself. Choose a coffee a drink, a salad. Mix things together.  Also the place looks too dark, and too open. At my first day I did eat the first breakfast at the hotel.  A the day after I did went to a restaurant. I write this because I care.",Positive,,,,,
"Elevators were very busy.  Also the security guard was a little rude.  We were having pizza in the lobby  and he came up without warning and said he had to leave NOW.  It would have been nice to have been told that the atrium area would be closing at 11, instead of kicking us out like we were braking the law....We were unaware that the atrium closed.",Negative,,,,,
James was amazing at the front desk: very friendly and accommodating. We appreciated the early check in.,Positive,,,,,
I was disappointed that they did away with the breakfast buffet. When I asked why they said it was because of Covid. Just struck me funny because last year when Colvid was the worse they have the breakfast buffet. I was going to eat breakfast there anyway but there was only one waitress and they were way way behind. We ended up going somewhere else,Negative,,,,,
Over an hour wait for food at the restaurant after ordering.  Staff using hand to strain out ice from mixed drinks.  Appetizer came out after dinner - said they would take it off the bill but they didn't,Positive,,,,,

"the hotel pub 313 is poorly run - we waited 30 minutes per drink order - and never were brought water to our table - we ordered food and it came 1 hour and 49 minutes later - very incorrect.  the staff didn't have a good system down - they took orders at all tables and made the drinks too?  how about bar staff and wait staff having defined roles - i stay at this hotel regularly and the food service is the worst.
additionally the hotel store/starbucks needs more than 1 or 2 employees when you have multiple events going on and hotel is full - waiting 45 minutes for a drink is ridiculous.",Negative,,,,,
The server at breakfast Thursday morning would rather have been somewhere else,Positive,,,,,
Beds were not made up after first night of stay and no other cleanup activity was evident.,Positive,,,,,
"When booking the room we selected for an early check in time. On our confirmation email our check in was 4pm, that's not early at all. When we called to see if we could check on earlier like we asked when booking the room we were told we had to call the morning of the reservation. Horrible for planning a trip.we called the morning of around 10 and were told we had to call sooner to the time we wanted to check in and told us to call back in an hour. Called around 12 and they said we could check in at 1pm but any sooner we would get charged extra. Git to the hotel around 1:30 and when checking in the employee said they didn't know if the room was available yet, but we were told it was over the phone. Told her was talked to someone and they said it was ready for us to check in at 1 and she had a snotty attitude with us the entire time.",Positive,,,,,

"Service at the front desk from Erin and Toby were exceptional.  James and Urba were also very friendly and helped to make our stay comfortable. My sister was in ICU at St. Vincent's Hospital and we made several changes to our check out dates.  They could not have been more accommodating, friendly, compassionate, and professional. They are what every traveler hopes for when checking into a hotel.
Mattia at the Starbucks counter was great in getting us starting in the morning--so friendly and efficient.
The needs of our family stay during a very stressful time were met beyond our expectations.",Positive,,,,,
"We were supposed to get 20% discounted breakfasts with our hotel event (The Titletown Tradathon (TAT)). I confirmed this at checkout with the manager at the front desk. While he assured me that we would get the credit approx $17 on our $84+ breakfast bill, and that our emailed receipt would have confirmation of such, no credit was received. Particularly disappointing, as he assured me it would be credited, and to â€œremember to complete the hotel survey.â€  Usually great service with our annual stay for this event over the past prior 15 years, but a bit different this year. Thanks for listening, Mark Stoering (Hyatt# G54729625D)",Positive,,,,,

"If you are short staffed at breakfast, go back to a buffet.  The staff worked hard, but the service was painfully slow.  I also didn't appreciate getting charged $2 for each refill of coffee.",Positive,,,,,
"The Check-in experience with Tobi was great. the restaurant was a real treat the food was some of the best I've ever had in a hotel. Shrimp and grits were the best I've had anywhere ever. Hat off to whoever put the menu together and to the chef for perfect execution and presentation. Taylor was professional and the customer service was great. Brooklyn was in the restaurant as well and she was also professional and courteous. These 3 individuals represented your hotel well and should be recognized for the level of service they provide your brand. I travel a lot for work and stay in hotels more than 100 nights a year. This experience was the best ive had ""EVER"".",Positive,,,,,
"I have absolutely no complaints, room was very clean, staff was great for getting extra blankets, etc.  Side note: there was a dried wash cloth draped over shower curtain bar (not a hotel washcloth as it was light green in color).  There was also a pair of women's jeans that were left on the floor in the closet from a previous person.  Both of these items could have easily been missed by the cleaning staff.  Room was great!",Positive,,,,,

"Breakfast was a joke, service was the worst I have experienced in a long time, even during Covid and prices were very inflated for such poor service.  I had to ask 3 times for a cup of water, more than 3 for a coffee refill seven though the small cup was $3, asked twice for butter for the toast, twice for cream and sugar for the coffee, etc.  Food was cold, even though the plate was hot??

I recognize COVID impacted many things, but attentive service and availability of that service is not something that should have to suffer.  Restaurant closing all food services by 9 pm on a Friday when the hotel is busy seems short sighted.  The Market is not an acceptable alternative.",Positive,,,,,
Staff was very responsive,Positive,,,,,
Paid for parking in a lot that was full and couldnâ€™t park plus a $25 early check in fee sucks. We checked in 30 minutes before actual check in time.,Negative,,,,,

"This hotel is unreasonably loud. My room was on the 4th floor on the opposite side of the pool and I could hear the people in the pool quite well. The food offered in the restaurant is minimal, and the front desk staff was unable to recomend a different restaurant.  The staff overall was very friendly and accommodating.",Positive,,,,,

Others who were at the conference that were there before me were able to check in without the early fee?

I was charged $5 a day for parking. I know others who were not charged and others who were charged $10.

I did ask if others were Hilton members or Hilton honor members they were not.

I think that everyone should be charged the same especially when we are all attending the same event and talk about our experience.",Positive,,,,,

The bar was out of a red blend so they let me try other wines, thank you, but I drank a wine that was only ok. Would have liked some healthier choices for snacks and supper so we ate elsewhere. Breakfast was costly for what was offered so we ate elsewhere.",Positive,,,,,

Leslie Rotter was extraordinary to work with!,Positive,,,,,
Wonderful staff!,Positive,,,,,
"I was disappointed that our room was turned down only once during our seven-day stay and then only because I went to the front desk and requested it. It would be nice too if there were coffee or at least water in the lobby for free. Overall, it felt like the cut-rate experience one would expect from a Motel 6.",Positive,,,,,

"We got to the hotel around 6 on to check in and they told us our room wasnâ€™t ready and it would be about 10-15 minutes. After 30 minutes of waiting I asked what the hold up was and they told me it was the room I had requested, it wasnâ€™t cleaned yet and they were very busy. So then they checked us into a room and it was a double Queen instead of the king we requested. At this point I didnâ€™t even say anything we just went with it. But it was disappointing.",Negative,,,,,
The guy doing the check in was very friendly and helpful with a very pleasant personality,Positive,,,,,

Scott in the bar/restaurant was amazing - he went above and beyond to be helpful,Positive,,,,,
"Overall my stay was great. Your hotel was very nice. Only had issues with the shower head and toilet. But those were quickly attended by staff. Out waitress during breakfast could have been more pleasant on Sunday, but maybe she was having a bad day. My waitress on saturday for breakfast was very nice. The bartenders Friday and Saturday afternoon were awesome. I really like your hotel, however I did not know you charged for parking, but was great to find out I could park across the street for FREE. I think you could let one vehicle per room park for free in your lot.",Positive,,,,,
Very nice hotel. Easy check in.,Positive,,,,,
"The hotel is represented in pictures much better than in person, itâ€™s dated and old and feelâ€™s dingy.  The restaurant/bar was closed for a training event which was very frustrating as that was one of the reasons I picked this hotel.  I wonâ€™t be back.",Positive,,,,,
"One of my things is the carpeting in public areas. It needed vacuuming. Maybe my expectations on a busy weekend are too high. The carpeting and furnishing in guest rooms need an update. The beds are very comfortable. I wouldn't change those! The staff  (except for one Starbucks barista) through the entire facility are very helpful and friendly. Great job on whatever it is in the Hyatt World that makes that consistent across staff members. I really liked the accessibility to the river walkways. Even though it was freezing out, I walked several times over our 3 day stay. I will come back. I haven't been at this property for over 20 years and was curious about how it aged.",Positive,,,,,
Parking was horrible. I had to park in the lot across the street. And I still got charged for parking.,Negative,,,,,
"The hotel is so beautiful and grand and we will definitely be returning. The rooms could use a little pick me up with new carpet, clean curtains and new mattresses in the sofabeds. The bathrooms are a bit small, but nice. Overall, it's an absolute wonderful hotel.",Positive,,,,,

"There were issues with my food for the dance retreat weekend. I need gluten free, no garlic, no onion. The kitchen knew this ahead of time and for the past two dance retreat weekends, they did an excellent job. I had my cards with my name and allergies listed. This time, was not so good. Friday night was fine, not much food, but I could eat it. However, my dinner on Saturday came filled with onions, lots of them! I couldn't eat it and they were unable to make me anything else other than some plain green beans about an hour later-the dance was starting already.  Also there were not enough desserts on our table and when we asked for two more so that everyone had one, we were told there were no more! How do you set the tables for the group, set the desserts out and not have one for everyone!?? Then, on Sunday morning when I gave my allergy card to the server for my meal, he told me that they did not have a plate for me! I was hungry the whole weekend! After the great job the kitchen did last time, I was really looking forward to it this time....",Positive,,,,,
"No blankets in room. If not cleaning room daily, should at least provide clean towels.",Positive,,,,,
Maybe a few more carts available to haul your suitcases etc. on.,Positive,,,,,
Front desk should explain parking in a much more detailed way. We weren't aware after paying for parking that there wouldn't be any spaces available. Maybe get a certain amount of parking tickets for people who pay for parking so they are actually guaranteed their spot. Returning late at night to be told we need to go across the street into a parking ramp was not very pleasing when we paid the nightly fee. The front desk did comp the fee however this should have been explained prior to me returning late at night only to not know what to do.,Positive,,,,,
"Our biggest disappointment was that the room wasnâ€™t freshened and towels werenâ€™t replaced on the middle day of our stay. They could have at least brought us clean towels. Bathroom was cramped, but kitchen/bar area was very nice.",Positive,,,,,
"The night of arrival, several of us from our group went to the in-hotel bar for drinks and food.  The bartender was quite rude to us. We ended up with three different servers and in the end they had the bills are mixed up and one of our group paid for all of it.

The next day at breakfast we waited over 20 min to be seated before we finally had to flag down a server and ask to be seated.  We waited 20 min for our food which never came and we were told it was all made to order and would be out soon.  We waited another 10 min with no food and finally left. The next day however our ""made to order"" breakfast was out in 5 minutes.",Positive,,,,,
"You were severely understaffed at breakfast on 3/23. I and my colleagues waited in line for 15-20 minutes and no one even greeted us let alone sat us at a table. I eventually went to the front coffee shop for a coffee and yogurt. On 3/24, you had more staff and I was seated promptly.",Positive,,,,,
Maybe youâ€™re short staffed but the coffee area in the front was chaotic with little to no efficiency in getting people coffee.,Positive,,,,,
The sofa in the room had appeared someone had burn part of it,Negative,,,,,
"We were unable to come to resolution about payment for parking.  The host of the meeting said they would validate the ticket.  The person at the desk didn't understand.  The $5 charge was on our invoice.
The hotel was very nice.  I thought the price was appropriate for the accommodations.  Thank you.",Positive,,,,,
"As I had only two days of bath towels, etc..., I asked to have my room cleaned after two days and was refused. On day two, I came down for breakfast, after 5 minutes of waiting a lady came to the podium where the wait to be seated sign was attached. She informed that there would be a wait of approximately 10 minutes and I asked why, to which she responded that no tables were available. I could see six open tables, so with only four people waiting for tables there would have been two additional. I then said that there are six tables available, to which she responded, they are not clean. Instead of going to the tables to wipe them off, she continued to stand at the podium. Myself and one other gentleman walked away. I went back to my room to retrieve my jacket, as now I was going out to breakfast and after waiting on the elevator, getting my jacket, waiting on the elevator again, when I got back to the main floor, she was just starting to wipe the tables and the two who waited were still waiting. I will NEVER again stay at this or any Hyatt property.",Positive,,,,,
I waited at the front desk for 10 minutes before someone acknowledged me.  The employees were running around and didnâ€™t even acknowledge me.,Neutral,,,,,
"the breakfast menu seemed a little small, not a lot of choices, but the food was good and the people serving were excellent",Positive,,,,,
"I was double billed and I would like someone to contact me ASAP!  I tried getting a hold of accounting earlier this week and it never was answered.  My school, Winneconne High School, sent a check for $390 to pay the fee at a tax exempt rate.  I was asked at the desk to give a credit card for incidentals.  There were not any incidentals, but I was billed once again for our 3 rooms at full rate.  I would like those charges taken off my credit card ASAP!  Thank you!  Jim",Positive,,,,,
Room had the odor of smoke,Negative,,,,,
The front desk was more than helpful. Better than expected.,Positive,,,,,
"I want to emphasize that your front desk staff were very welcoming and professional.  Also, an employee (not sure of his position) stepped forward in a friendly manner to offer assistance/directions when I was departing (maybe I looked lost/confused?). Both this young man and the front desk staff were impressive. The breakfast was a little slow but ok (under staffed?). I was, however, disappointed that the pub/restaurant was closed the night I stayed. I really didnâ€™t want to have to go out to eat. Also, the coffee I bought from the lobby store when departing was barely warm and not fresh. Iâ€™m surprised Starbucks would allow the product to be associated with their name, even under some kind of licensing agreement. Thank you for your interest.",Positive,,,,,
Was shocked that we were not informed about the 50 dollars added to the initial fee. Understand why but communication leaves a lot to be desired.,Negative,,,,,
The road noise and guests running in the halls and slamming doors all night really makes it difficult to recommend the hotel.,Negative,,,,,
"REALLY liked that we could register and checkout online. Once we were checked in, getting the alert that our room was ready 1 hour ahead of schedule was really nice!",Positive,,,,,
There was no parking in the hotel lot so I had to park down the street in a parking ramp and when I was returning to my room from the ramp late at night their were homeless people sleeping in the stairwell of the hotel from the skywalk.  Better signage is needed to direct hotel customers on getting from the ramp to the lobby of the hotel. I did not feel safe having to walk from the parking ramp to the hotel.  I will NOT be staying at this hotel again.,Positive,,,,,
"All of the front desk personnel that I spoke with at anytime during my visit and also the gentleman who was on duty for maintenance on the night of 3/16/22 were very polite, helpful and timely with their assistance. :-)",Positive,,,,,
Andrew Monroe stood out during the check-in process and continued to be extremely helpful during our stay. He went above and beyond my expectations,Positive,,,,,
Make sure all linens are in good condition - a pillowcase was ripped and my sheets had holes in them.,Positive,,,,,
Great experience.,Positive,,,,,
Had a very pleasant stay and customer service was excellent.,Positive,,,,,
"Room temp is a big deal for me.  I like to keep my room and home about 65% year around, especially when I sleep.  Hotels don't often allow the room temps that low in the winter months, yours included.  As such I opened the window, but would have preferred not to.",Positive,,,,,
I loved your hotel suites. Great space and hotel is beautiful,Positive,,,,,
Turned in my tax exempt paperwork but was still charged tax on my bill,Negative,,,,,
Again nothing was done all weekend byabout the marijuana smell,Negative,,,,,
Stay was fabulous. Only thing is that there was a dirty pair of mens boxers on the floor in front of the closet. They were dark and maybe missed by housekeeping.  We did mention this at checkout,Negative,,,,,
"Parking instructions were not given when making appointment. It was very confusing. Other than that, it was a great experience. Very nice staff. Thank you!",Positive,,,,,
"On check in I didnâ€™t get a breakfast ticket, poor check in procedure. If you are upgrading rooms fix the bathrooms very old and barely functional.",Positive,,,,,
I enjoyed my stay.  Thank you to the staff for helping me as I had forgotten my phone charger in my room and did not realize it until after I had checked out.  The staff was great and housekeeping had saved my phone charger for me.  Thank you.,Positive,,,,,
We had blood stains on our comforter and our heat didnâ€™t work well.,Positive,,,,,
Food for the breakfast for the wedding was not hot. The food at the reception was good but it took so long for clearing that people left the tables before the cake was served. Our server took away the dessert forks and had to bring some back when he brought the cake. The cake should have come out shortly after the hot food was served and then clear dishes as people finished. As it was the wedding party was gone from their seats before cake was served.,Positive,,,,,
Food was wonderful.,Positive,,,,,
The hotel was old and needs to be updated. The elevator was slow.  The biggest issue was the lack of temperature control in my room.,Negative,,,,,
Every staff member I came in contact with was very friendly and helpful. From the main desk at check in and check out to the staff I met in the halls.,Positive,,,,,
Great hotel.  Very clean.  Food was outstanding.,Positive,,,,,
Not enough toilet paper in the room.  It ran out.,Positive,,,,,
"Great check in experience, very clean hotel and wonderful atmosphere!",Positive,,,,,
"Breakfast was an absolute disaster.  Only 2 servers and we were 2nd to be seated at 7am and took almost 2 hours. 30 minutes to order.  30 minutes for half our food, then 30 minutes to get the rest and then 30 minutes just for the bill. Absolute ridiculous.  It was busy we get that but try to get people in and out to flow better. Otherwise it's a beautiful hotel and amazing rooms.",Positive,,,,,
Very enjoyable stay!,Positive,,,,,
"I love the suite concept, having the extra room is very nice.",Positive,,,,,
"There were a bunch of noisy farm kids at the hotel for a Future Farmers of America event. The hotel management should have worked with the organizers to keep these kids under control.  Also, you need to do something about your doors so that they don't make a slamming noise when you close them.

Finally, your scales are backward 1------>10 (I am a professor who teaches survey design).",Negative,,,,,
For people who are scared of heights the elevators are a little distressing.,Negative,,,,,
Would like more lights in bedroom.,Positive,,,,,
"I completely understand changes, but Iâ€™ve stayed at this hotel many times in the last 20 years and Iâ€™ve always enjoyed it. This time, things changed a bit for me. I stayed here during a conference recently and when I made the reservation over the phone, they informed me that breakfast would be apart if the conference package. When I arrived at check in, they gave me coupons for 20% off at the restaurant for my stay. I think itâ€™s also time hotels get back into continental breakfast for their travelers. At one time, this hotel had the best breakfast Iâ€™ve ever had in a hotel because it looked and tasted great, it was fresh and everyone loved it! I feel that most people who stay at hotels are more excited about the breakfast than the stay itself. I do have to say, however, this hotel has always been clean, safe, and just plain cool.",Positive,,,,,
"Thank you, we had a very nice experience.",Positive,,,,,
Friendly staff at check in desk.,Positive,,,,,
"Torn sheets on bed, had to PAY to park, no complimentary Breakfast, restaurant was our of many items.",Positive,,,,,
"Your Hotel manager, front desk and restaurant staff were very professional and personable. We had a very enjoyable stay at your hotel.",Positive,,,,,
During big conventions the breakfast restaurant is not big or fast enough to serve everyone.  We ended up leaving each day to get breakfast,Positive,,,,,
Wonderful acommodations. Helpful friendly staff! Thanks so much!!!,Positive,,,,,
The sliding glass door needs to be cleaned,Neutral,,,,,
"The security staff that worked on Friday night 3/11/22 were causing more of a disruption than the individuals they removed from hotel, when the majority of the hotel is All apart of the same conference some consideration needs to be had. Although names where called I donâ€™t believe the situation required 4 of green bays finest police officers along with 3 lesser trained security officers. The security guard flexing his power put a bad taste in many of the conference attendees which ultimately hurts future attendees which ultimately hurts the fire association which ultimately hurts all the people and communityâ€™s served by the firefighters in those communityâ€™s",Negative,,,,,
Wish breakfast was still included. Realize that a buffet doesnâ€™t work yet due to Covid but wasnâ€™t expecting to pay extra for breakfast.,Positive,,,,,
Not sure on why we got kicked out of the Fourier at 11pm.  We were just in a group talking and not hurting anyone.  So we went to one of our rooms to continue our conversation and had to keep the room door open and then got informed that we could not even do that.  The room was so hot that we had to do something to cool it down.,Positive,,,,,
Perfect,Positive,,,,,
Staff was wonderful!  Beds are however horrible!  Very uncomfortable!!  Food in banquet hall was not good either.,Positive,,,,,
"For some reason, the thermostats don't seem to work.  Room was colder than I would like but heat did not respond to turning up thermostat.",Positive,,,,,
"Very noisy, hard to sleep, rooms are very outdated, bathroom way too small, having to pay for parking is ridiculous, no creamer for coffee, too many things to convince me to never stay at. Hyatt again. Very disappointing especially given the cost.",Negative,,,,,
"Some paint chipping in bathroom. Noted heat lamp only and no fan. Carpet was bunched up in areas, could present a trip hazard in room. Clean overall and nice visit.",Positive,,,,,
"The parking situation could be better, but it is what it is.",Positive,,,,,
Understanding the effects of COVID on day to day operation it seemed that the breakfast prep took quite some time. However the food was very good and the portions were generous. There were plenty of servers and they were very polite.,Positive,,,,,
"Front desk staff were polite and helpful.  We appreciated the hotel being dog friendly.
Surprised by the $25 fee to check out at 1:00pm.",Positive,,,,,
"Had a great stay.  Great customer service, beautiful hotel.  Kids had a lot of fun in pool and hot tub. Our family will definitely be going back.",Positive,,,,,
Your security was very disrespectful to us he was demanding we went to are room for little to no reason when there where other people show there ass in the elevator and being loud as shit he should have even talk to us like that and should have handled the other people not us we where just coming back in from a cigarette,Negative,,,,,
"We were obligated to pay a parking fee to stay at the hotel we paid to stay at. When asking the reasoning at check in, we were told what did we expect, it is in the city. I replied with   "" just spent 2 nights in what I had considered the city (next to Lambeau Field) and was NOT charged to park my vehicle!"" At which time the front desk attendant says, Well what do you want me to do? That is our Policy. She then proceeded to state we could potentially park in the parking ramp across the street only until 6:30 am if we wanted something ""free""!    I obviously was not anticipating waking up at 6am to move my car or to check out, so she finally stated, if I waive the parking fee, will that make you happy? Um, ya?",Positive,,,,,
The only problem I had was the paying for parking and the room keys not working for the gate to let in and out,Negative,,,,,
Amazing,Positive,,,,,
A lot of confusion with check in an check out. Room smelled moldy. Affter check out I requested a receipt. Total was 461._ _ . However my card company stated 563._ _ was charged. Affter a phone call to the motel I was informed it would take a few days to process. I hope this is the case. Many of the staff went out of there way to assist me.,Positive,,,,,
"Your Paul Blart security guys are the most disrespectful, unfriendly people we have ever meet.",Negative,,,,,
"Lighting in the â€œliving roomâ€ may be fine for watching tv, but itâ€™s terrible for reading. TV did not show the channel numbers ( bedroom TV is fine).
At breakfast time, we waited for five minutes for someone to come to the station and seat us. No one came. We left.
Manager of the Pub was especially good. Service good, food good.",Positive,,,,,
Check in was a pleasant experience.,Positive,,,,,
"I've stayed at this hotel many times over the years, but never as a Hyatt. Things have gone downhill without a doubt. It makes me sad. The manager was nice enough, lady at coffee area was nice but being overworked. It may totally  be a function of not enough stay. Not sure of this or not, but you need improvements. Restaurant was severely understaffed, for sure.",Positive,,,,,
We used the stairs many times because of ridiculous wait for the elevators..,Negative,,,,,
"We were glad to have the extra door to our bedroom, otherwise the room would have been too loud late at night given that people were hanging out in the lobby. Other than that, we had a delightful stay.",Positive,,,,,
Staff was very helpful with any questions I had and James was super friendly and courteous.,Positive,,,,,
"It took well over an hour to get our food on Friday evening. We had to go to the bar for our own drinks, didn't get our appetizer as expected (came with dinner) and the wait staff was unable to split a check. 
Our dance group was sitting in the lobby area being quite and respectful and we were asked to go up to our rooms at 10:30 because it was too late. I've never had this happen at a Hyatt before. Then security and another woman were walking around and knocked on our door requesting we be respectful. We had a very reasonable volume. Our girls were nervous about even leaving the room for fear of ""getting in trouble"".",Positive,,,,,
You have a very beautiful hotel.  Amongst the prettiest I have seen.  I love visiting your place.  We love the bar but wish there was  adult hours for the hot tub and pool.,Positive,,,,,
Will stay again without a doubt,Negative,,,,,
Never again bad experience,Negative,,,,,
"Elevators are terribly slow when u are on the 8th floor.  Someone belong me was smoking Marijuana and it came up through the bathroom vent.  I put a towel in front of the vent and closed the door, which cut it down a lot.  Bathroom fans would be nice",Negative,,,,,
All of the staff was friendly and went above what was expected,Positive,,,,,
The guy at check in was so friendly and willing to help with anything.,Positive,,,,,
Cleanest hotel I've ever stayed in. Extremely helpful staff.,Positive,,,,,
None else at this time.,Negative,,,,,
I recently got the Hyatt credit card so I switched my travel to the Hyatt.  I switched from Hilton to Hyatt however I was disappointed that I have to pay for parking in Green Bay.,Negative,,,,,
Staff was friendly.   Hotel was clean.  Pool was great.   Breakfast was excellent.,Positive,,,,,
The workers at the 24hr market were fabulous!,Positive,,,,,
"When eating at the hotel, it's a bit concerning that all you have to do is put down the room number to ""credit"" the room. We got charged food that we never bought! (Thank you customer service for fixing it). Lucky for me though that I went and asked about everything or I would never have known. A recommendation would be to have a double check like last name associated with room number so situations like this can be eliminated or reduced.",Positive,,,,,
2 things first I was scheduled to come for the weekend for a dance competition and found out that I did not need to arrive I contacted a week ahead that I only needed one night not two and I went around and round with the first person that said this could not be changed.  She said we could not resolved this and was going to hang up and I asked to speak to the hotel.  Initially they said the same thing but they did figure out a way to do it but this still took me about an hour.  Second thing is this nickle and diming for everything is going to make me look for different hotels in areas moving forward.  The additional charge to check-in early for a room that is ready this is the first I have heard of this and not customer friendly.  I understand if the room is not available but when I arrive and check and it is ready but to get in early need to pay an additional fee is crazy.,Positive,,,,,
The staff could have helped me move all of my luggage to my new room as well as offered me a free breakfast or even a cup of coffee for the hassle. I would have been happier if they offered to find me a room at the Hampton Inn across the street since they probably had windows in their room and no bed bugs.,Positive,,,,,
Checkin was very pleasant. I asked about a late checkin and they offered complimentary checkout at noon. It was not portrayed in my reservation when I contacted them on check out day they said they would charge me for the extra dollar. When I mentioned they offered she said she canâ€™t change it and that should not have been offered,Positive,,,,,
James at the front desk was a pleasure to deal with. Made check in easy and made sure I had all the information I needed.,Positive,,,,,
"Great waiter at the Pub333 for dinner. He was cheerful, professional and we enjoyed our meal greatly.",Positive,,,,,
"The check in person, Ebru, was very helpful and knowledgeable. 
The pool was wonderful",Positive,,,,,
Great place to stay and relax keep up the great work and also staff are excellent,Positive,,,,,
Part of a group...our name was written down by group organizer to be inputted.  It was not. I had to contact her to call and speak with the desk. It was a horrible experience.  Our toilet leaked. The curtains were shabby and torn. No signage from the Skywalk directing us to hotel entrance... need I go on?,Negative,,,,,
"Did not realize it was the convention hotel, the families that were there that weekend for the dance convention created a lot of noise that drifted up through the atrium to the rooms, pool area was extremely crowded. Was looking for a more quiet getaway.",Positive,,,,,
The site says the pool is open till midnight but it closed at 10.,Positive,,,,,
Only thing that was hard to us was the price of food for our family of 6. It was good and expected though.,Positive,,,,,
Parking lot was always full. Wasnâ€™t told about the lot across the street until the 2nd day of my stay.,Neutral,,,,,
Love the sauna!,Positive,,,,,
James was very hospitable at the from desk.,Positive,,,,,
"Front desk worker Andrew was very helpful, kind, and answered all questions I had. Room 833 was perfect for the stay I had in mind. I was able to contact the front desk several times for additional coffee and towels needed that was delivered in an acceptable time. I have no complaints regarding my stay. Thank you for a good experience.",Positive,,,,,
"A $15 additional fee to check in at 12:45pm? We were told the rooms were ready, but we couldn't check in. We were staying for the conference. As a board member, we will need re-evaluate next year.",Positive,,,,,
Great stay.,Positive,,,,,
Except for losing my original reservation and it was a good thing i called before driving all the way to the hotel.,Neutral,,,,,
Would be nice if pool room opened earlier.,Negative,,,,,
"The staff were good; we had issues because I had originally tried to book the room as a block, however, they were not set up that way so we had issues getting the people that needed a room, their room.  We were also put on all different floors; which was the reason I booked all the rooms to start with and was disappointing.  I booked well over a month out; we should have been able to stay together as we wanted.  I had to call the call center to reserve my rooms 3 times; the third time the lady finally got it right.  The rooms and location were nice for what we wanted, but getting there was a pain in the butt.",Positive,,,,,
Get the heating and cooling fixed please,Positive,,,,,
Unhappy with the mask requirement and that the airport shuttle wasn't working.,Negative,,,,,
"I stayed on the 8th floor and was not able to cool my room down at night to sleep. For the second night, I asked for a fan and that helped. Everything else about my stay was wonderful!",Positive,,,,,
Didn't know you got charged for parking,Neutral,,,,,
"I was very impressed with the efficiency and professionalism at this hotel. James and Erin did a fantastic job at the front desk. I would like to point out that James was especially helpful and knowledgeable. He made me feel like he cared, that I was more than a number, he immediately took care of any questions.",Positive,,,,,
"Andrew at front desk was very helpful and friendly. The waiter whose name starts with A with accent (sorry, canâ€™t remember name) was great as well. Very attentive and friendly.",Positive,,,,,
"1. The mask policy in common areas is old and needs to be changed. 2. The lounge/bar staff were very kind and made great drinks. Limited menu was not friendly. :-( We didn't eat there because of that reason.  3. The parking is wonky, you get a parking pass that needs to be validated for a $10.00 per day fee or pay hourly if you don't validate. Nobody downtown GB charges for parking at a hotel, nobody. 4. The room was very nice and clean.",Positive,,,,,
The kids running up and down the hall was a little annoying but all in all we had a fantastic time.,Neutral,,,,,
I look forward to getting beyond the covid concerns so I can dispense my own drinks at breakfast.,Positive,,,,,
"James and Erin were there for us at check in and check out. They were friendly, beyond helpful and knowledgeable! They answered every question I had and helped accommodate every need we had! This has now become my favorite hotel in Green Bay! We have a daughter in college there, so we will visit many times a year and this is the only place I want to stay!",Positive,,,,,
"I was very disappointed with the security at the hotel. There were many youth teams at the hotel at the same time. The security claimed to have given our kids a warning (for going up and down the elevators???), but then continued to chew them out. 5 of 8 kids came to the parents in tears. I thought it was over the top. As a team manager for a youth hockey team, I will not be recommending you to our organization for future events in Green Bay.",Negative,,,,,
The staff was great.  The room condition was not.,Positive,,,,,
"quiet, clean and nice hotel  very friendly staff
one bad thing, the parking exit is incredibly difficult to get close to the meter - I did scratch/dent my silver jeep renegade trying to put ticket in
Told staff, but they did not say much",Positive,,,,,
"Paid for a deluxe suite not sure that is what we got. In the website it said the deluxe suite was a corner room which we did not get. Room was quite dusty, AC would not work and we could not get the room to cool down. Had to open up the sliding door to cool the room down. Splash pad was also not working which we were not told about. I would consider other hotels before I booked here again.",Positive,,,,,
Inner staircase would be nice,Positive,,,,,
Breakfast food is cheap.  Provided it for free or at least a reasonable price.  $16 for a breakfast is outrageous.,Positive,,,,,
"The breakfast was good but not very organized.   The lunch was terrible,  dinner was okay.",Positive,,,,,
The card I used for incidentals was not meant for the full room fee and the whole stay was charged onto that card. Very upsetting,Negative,,,,,
"This was one of the cleanest places we have stayed in. Our room was so large, much larger than we expected.",Positive,,,,,
The hotel lobby and hallway on the 4th floor were very noisy after midnight.,Negative,,,,,
I love your hotel. Thank you,Positive,,,,,
Need free coffee in lobby,Positive,,,,,
It was a lovely indoor oasis in the middle of winter.,Positive,,,,,
"Customer service during check-in could have been better, the individual talked way to fast, there was a lot of information that was given. It felt that due to us using Priceline, we didnt have any value. We shouldn't have to feel devalued if your company is listed on Priceline.
Parking should be free, the gate was opened Friday night into Saturday evening. Why do we have to pay for parking when anyone NON-guests can come and use the parking lot.
We decided to have breakfast, our waitress was never to be found.
I expected better from a Hyatt.",Positive,,,,,
"The hotel rooms are starting to show their age.  In their prime, the rooms were way above average, so they are still pretty darn nice!  The food service safety (Covid) was way above average from other places I have been lately.  I really appreciated that, however it also resulted in the slowest food service I have experienced ever at this conference.",Positive,,,,,
It appears that the hotel may be in need of an update/remodel. Tables in conference rooms were dirty and very worn. Elevators are very slow. Room was not ready until after 5 pm. Staff was great and food was very good.,Positive,,,,,
Some confusion about how to navigate payment for parking,Negative,,,,,
Our room was spacious and very comfortable.,Positive,,,,,
I was staying there for a conference.  Everything to check in to check out was excellent.,Positive,,,,,
James was very welcoming and acknowledged us like we were family. Our stay was great!,Positive,,,,,
A member of our party lost a sentiment stuffed bunny. You recovered it!! Priceless!,Positive,,,,,
James was amazing! He helped us with all questions we had! Great customer service.,Positive,,,,,
The food is great but very few vegetarian/vegan options,Positive,,,,,
Breakfast was a limited selection a buffet wouldâ€™ve been nice,Positive,,,,,
Pool and Hot tub area extremely busy making it not overly enjoyable to use. $10 parking fee is a deterrent from me returning to this hotel in the future.,Positive,,,,,
We had a great time,Positive,,,,,
Came and stayed. Expected better. Probably won't come back.,Negative,,,,,
The front desk staff are always the best here!,Positive,,,,,
Checking in & out at the front desk was very pleasant.  The young girl working as the breakfast host was on her phone & not friendly.  She was rude and dismissive.  She should not work in customer service.,Positive,,,,,
Rooms need update to be on par with expected Hyatt standards,Neutral,,,,,
Food took over an hour for dinner (dine in) as well as breakfast,Positive,,,,,
"There was no enforcement of quiet hours. Talking is over things, but kids from other teams were running up and down the halls until midnight! Front desk was contacted numerous times from multiple people but nothing was done. Our breakfast ticket was ""lost"" and we waited an hour and a half for our food. We are wanting to stay again in April, but we're very hesitant, as is the rest of our team of young girls (3-5 years old).",Negative,,,,,
Elevators are slow. Overall it isn't bad at all.,Positive,,,,,
The walls and ceiling in our room were not in the best condition but did not affect the quality of our stay,Positive,,,,,
Very nice wonderful service at the front desk very helpful answered all my questions,Positive,,,,,
Your staff were quite good and have had several excellent stays at your facility.,Positive,,,,,
"I just want to say I love this place as I stay weekly. I also want to let you know that Scott makes a huge difference in the experience we have in the pub and he adds a leadership and positive energy that is not there when he is gone. For example, when he was on vacation there was a significant difference in the level of service. One night we were almost turned down the opportunity to order food 15 min before the kitchen even closes and the restaurant and bar were doing last call very early with a full bar of people. There was another globalist there who frequently stays at the hotel and he wondered where Scott was because he said his service is always the best and he would never close this early with this many people. Scott is awesome at his job and he truly cares about the staff he works with and his customers. He is a leader and it shows. He makes a difference. As a globalist, I wanted to be sure I let you all know.  Thank you!",Positive,,,,,
The breakfast left something to be desired. A self serve station may have served better this past weekend as they couldnâ€™t keep up with the demand.,Positive,,,,,
There was only one bartender & we had to wait  long time to order food & get a drink.,Positive,,,,,
"The hotel itself was much prettier on the inside then what I was expecting from the outside. Our room was spacious which I really appreciated since I had my kids with me. But I noticed 2 of the pillow cases looked like they hadn't been changed or were just stained. They had orange marks like cheeto on them. The thermostat was a frustration for us over the weekend. I turned it down numerous times and the room never got below 70 degrees. For me that's just too warm and stuffy. We ended up leaving the sliding glass door open whenever we were in the room, even while we were sleeping. Thankfully we were on the 7th floor so the noise from the street below wasn't too bad. But that lack of air flow was an issue for us. Also the bathrooms had no towel rack. That was only a slight inconvenience but it seemed odd to me to not have one. As for the food at the hotel I only had breakfast. I was warned that the restaurant was having very long wait times (upwards of 2 hours) so we opted to ordered take out and have it delivered. The breakfast wait times were also fairly long and we probably waited about an hour for our food. Overall we enjoyed our stay at the hotel and understand that it was full because of a cheer competition (which is what we were there for) and many places are short staffed. So we did have to give them some grace for that. I lived that the rooms had a door that separated the living room from the bedroom because that meant our daughter could sit up and hang out with her friend without waking her younger sister. It almost had a sma apartment feel to it. I would definitely consider staying there again in the future.",Positive,,,,,
"It would have been nice to be able to some how know there was a cheer competition going on the weekend of our stay. Kids were running everywhere and being very loud at 6:30 in the morning. They played in the elevator all evening ruining it up and down and pushing all the buttons, and just seemed to run wild. My daughter does high school cheer, we have never encountered anything like this! I paid for Parking for 3 nights and could only park Sunday night, I did get my money back for the 2 nights I was not able to use your parking lot. I also understand I booked through a third party. But it was quite a surprise with how these kids were allowed to behave and run wild.",Positive,,,,,
Update and paint the stairways itâ€™s the only bad thing in the hotel,Negative,,,,,
Everything was wonderful. It was my first time staying here. I really appreciated how World of Hyatt members were given 50% off parking!,Positive,,,,,

"I have been trying to discuss my concerns with a manger. I will not be back to the hotel, unless the situation is rectified.",Negative,,,,,
Pool and hot tub and hotel was super packed and loud all night,Positive,,,,,
"Some unsightly drywall patches in bathroom, room 604.  Hire a decorator for touch ups to keep this amazing property top notch!  Just something we in the trades notice.  Food quality could and should be much better.  Multiple folks commented on the low quality while I dined.  Either keep it simple with more typical bar fare, or execute the menu correctly.  Guest services was professional, stuck to policy, yet accommodated me well.  I will stay at this hotel for business and leisure again.",Positive,,,,,
"We stayed in room 235 and there is an annoying humming noise almost like a pump or the elevators going up and down, not sure what it was, that made it hard to fall asleep without the TV on. Otherwise we were very satisfied with our stay and our room.",Positive,,,,,
The staff was fantastic.  Restaurant food was EXCELLENT!!!,Positive,,,,,
"There were a few things I was not happy with: 1) 99.9% of people were not wearing masks when there were signs everywhere saying they are required.  Why have signs up if you're not going to enforce it...?  2) We at at Pub333 Friday night.  We sat at the bar, and ordered food and drinks.  We were told food would be about 45 min.  After an hour and a half, we finally got our burgers, but my wife and I both didn't get what we ordered.  I said something to the bartender and he took that add on's off of the bill.  I didn't want to send it back because I was starving and didn't know how long it would take.  3) Saturday, I personally went to the front desk requesting another paper coffee cup for my room.  The front desk person couldn't find one, so he said he would have one sent up to my room.  It never arrived.  4) At no point did I see a cart to carry our bags.  I understand people take them and keep them in there room....But maybe have more..?",Positive,,,,,
"The hotel was maintained and many employees caring for it daily. Check in and check out were simplified on the mobile end. Our stay was slightly unsatisfactory due to customer service. Most of our customer service interactions seemed as if they were either: not eager to assist/wait on or assist with finding a solution, averagely friendly in the bar/restaurant area, or possibly overworked (only saw 1 helpful male manager at the front desk, in all areas of the hotel). Specifically 1 female employee at breakfast was argumentative with 3 different customers that I saw interactions of and we did not go back the next morning. Unfortunately, all employees seem as if they have no moral or wiliness or want to be there, and it is disappointing to see that or have that atmosphere.",Positive,,,,,
Kids and I Got woke up after 11pm from staff having wrong room bring pillows,Negative,,,,,
"The check in person was amazing, my room not so much.  It was our second time staying here and the last time was amazing and with the condition of our room this last stay I doubt we will be back, or our cheer team for the comp that was hosted.",Negative,,,,,
Taylor in the restaurant was a fantastic server. She was attentive and impressive.,Positive,,,,,
It would be nice if the pool opened earlier so that we could swim before check outâ€¦.especially for kids.,Positive,,,,,
Excellent experience from beginning to end!,Positive,,,,,
I was given a room upgrade. Great room!,Positive,,,,,
Having to wear a mask in February of 2021 when  most places and activities are going back to normal was unfortunate.,Negative,,,,,
No one enforced the mask which was awesome.,Positive,,,,,
Customer service agents were all very nice and helpful.,Positive,,,,,
"The wait staff was lacking in every way. They were almost non existent throughout our breakfast. Never offering any more service of coffee, condiments. I had to find them to pay the check. They also looked very unhappy and un friendly.",Positive,,,,,
"We couldnâ€™t sleep because the guests in the adjacent room were being loud and there is not enough sound insulation between rooms. Plus, we couldnâ€™t even drown out the noise with AC/fan unless we wanted to boil ourselves to death because the only way to keep the system running was to turn the heat way up.",Negative,,,,,
"The staff was wonderful, very friendly and helpful",Positive,,,,,
"The deep cleaning fee was a little high, I chose to board my dog on the 2nd night and still had to pay the full fee. I think it should be reduced.  Some people cannot absorb that cost.",Negative,,,,,
"The food from bar was horrible. Moldy bread on BLT, chicken wings were disgusting, spinach artichoke dip tasted like cream cheese. Breakfast was decent though.",Positive,,,,,
"I know this hotel quite well. I have stayed there under previous owners. Still a great hotel.
I have one BIG recommendation; change the round kiddy toilets to new OVAL, Comfort Height that also use less water. Your guests will be happier and you will save a LOT of MONEY on your water bill. This is a common topic among my friends as we travel.",Positive,,,,,
Mr. Monroe was very helpful and pleasant on our checkin.,Positive,,,,,
Please tell vacationers the parking policy and give us the protocol for getting in and out and a flyer because itâ€™s easily forgotten and I had trouble on arrival and leaving so even signage out by parking stations otherwise an excellent stay,Positive,,,,,
"James was particularly helpful and professional, both at check-in and during my stay.",Positive,,,,,
"Mask optional would have been great.
The bar closed at 9:00 p.m. just as we got back which was kind of brutal.
The rooms are poorly lit.
In your lobby you have four different types of light bulbs, all casting different types of light. It's not a very warm environment.
Having to wear a mask while running on a treadmill was just insane.",Negative,,,,,
"Was upgraded to a suite which was lovely! It was a little dated, but very clean and roomy!",Positive,,,,,
The guy at the front desk was very helpful and friendly! He told us a really cool local bar to check out and we had a blast!,Positive,,,,,
Jesse is the bomb & so is everyone else ...i was extremely impressed & had a fantastic weekend,Positive,,,,,
The hotel staff was awesome,Positive,,,,,
Very accommodating and friendly! Loved the staff!!,Positive,,,,,
"clean, and comfortable room",Positive,,,,,
James helped make our stay  pleasant and friendly.  We would certainly like to suggest the toilet in room 230  be replaced with an adult sized toilet.  This was so small and so low to the ground.,Positive,,,,,
Dirty wash rag on shower rod and missing blanket in room,Negative,,,,,
"The one thing I did not like was that there were NO towel racks in the bathroom so no towels could be hung up which I think is absolutely ridiculous.  Also, having to pay for parking in the hotel parking lot just was crazy.",Negative,,,,,
"Room 501 does not have a light as you enter the room. Couldnâ€™t read all the notices on the inside of the door. Also, there was a locked door by the kitchen area with nothing to prevent someone from using a key and walking in. Didnâ€™t feel safe.",Positive,,,,,
"James was super helpful with some of our accommodations and that was greatly appreciated.  The bathroom was the only disappointment, it's small and the toilet's were really low to the ground.  If you could just replace the toilets to someone higher, it would make a big difference.  I felt like I was at a preschool or grade school.  The rest of the stay and the food and service was truly excellent.",Positive,,,,,
The staff in all aspects of this resort were very kind and willing to help when anything was needed. I'm ready to ask for advice with my own staff to get their customer service on the same page. Amazing customer service skills!!,Positive,,,,,
Evriting good only the foot  service  is no warm,Positive,,,,,
Our bartender was awesome! I believe his name was Scott.,Positive,,,,,
Just the check in was a little slow,Negative,,,,,
Great job! Keep it up.,Positive,,,,,
"Your front desk staff was awesome, and particularly Tobi. He was working the front desk and market alone on Friday. I had asked for a Starbucks beverage, which he made, but then I discovered it was incorrect. I asked him to remake it, which he gladly did, and it was then that I realized he was there alone. There were other guests needing assistance but he did not waiver on his kindness, pleasant interaction, and reassurance that everything was fine. He was awesome.

There was, unfortunately, one restaurant staff member, who wasn't as pleasant. I felt like a nuisance ordering breakfast (on Wednesday) and as though it was a bother. It's difficult to see a person's true expressions when they're wearing a mask (which, by the way, I really, really wish you would do away with), but her tone was more often than not not so great. On Friday when I first went to the market to order a Starbucks beverage, she was behind the counter making a drink. So I asked if they were open (I believe it was just 7am), and she said she wasn't the barista and I would have to go to the front desk. Again, it was the tone. 

It did seem that you were understaffed at times, and I can't imagine the stress that brings to an already stressful industry. However, I think it's important to always try to put any frustrations aside and treat your guests with kindness. But again, overall, the staff I encountered was exceptional. It was a very nice stay.",Positive,,,,,
The staff never told us about the 50.00 dollar deposit added to the bill. I called when I noticed it on my credit card bill.,Positive,,,,,
"The front desk staff was helpful and kind.  The breakfast situation was abyssmal.  Service was slow.  Food was good, but service was slow, seating was slow.  Not helpful at all for business travelers.  And the indoor restaurant was closed Sunday.  With no other restaurants in the immediate area - granted downtown is close, but it is cold in the winter.  They could have at least had a bartender / service and a limited menu.  Grateful for the market store.",Positive,,,,,
LOVED the pool!!!,Positive,,,,,
"Slow elevator, great staff.",Positive,,,,,
Would like to see toilets upgraded to comfort level - hard for old legs to get up and down!!,Positive,,,,,
Apparently they are changing policies and not giving Globalists free parking or F&B credit when departing the hotel the next morning at 5a before any F&B service begins,Positive,,,,,
"Never stayed there before, pool liked nice, and rooms were great with that sitting area, couch and bar!",Positive,,,,,
Andrew at the front desk was extremely accommodating and a pleasure to work with!,Positive,,,,,
"Payment for parking was not clearly explained. Hotel staff only stated that they validate your parking, implies that parking is free. Was surprised to see $10 charge on the bill.",Positive,,,,,
"I left something in my room...called several times, left message for housekeepin",Neutral,,,,,
I notice I cannot write much; MKE Hyatt was BAD; BARTENDER STOLE MONEY FROM ME! and then when I complained~nothing! Left things in room and no one returned my call...bad business. I am trying to get convention people to NEVER STAY AT HYATT!,Negative,,,,,
These rooms GREATLY need updating.  The furnishings are tired and worn.  The worst part was that our pillows smelled old and musty.  We asked for replacement pillows and when we opened the plastic bag containing them they smelled just as bag.  The woman who delivered them said she was unable to smell and while in our room coughed and sneezed continuously.  In a Covid world someone who is experiencing upper respiratory issues shouldn't be working.  Your breakfast food selection was minimal and mediocre.  It was a mediocre experience staying in your hotel and we doubt we'd stay there again.,Negative,,,,,
The front desk staff was very friendly and accommodating.,Positive,,,,,
"No room service and the restaurant was unresponsive. I wanted a to-go order because I wanted to eat in my room, not in the restaurant.",Positive,,,,,
"Loved the motion sensing light on the nightstands in the room. Did not hear any noise from other guests. 

The bathroom ceiling in the shower was rotten, and sagging. But it didnâ€™t affect my stay at all.",Negative,,,,,
I was disappointed that the mask policy wasn't being enforced at all for guests.,Negative,,,,,
Hotel bar closed at early hour with 30-40 guests inside.  Most guests were part of conferences taking place at hotel.  This should have been anticipated.,Neutral,,,,,
Couldnâ€™t understand the lady checking us in. Her accent was very thick,Positive,,,,,
"The reason I gave low scores was because of an experience I had with Pier 33 at the Hyatt in Green Bay.  I was on my way to the convention (AWSA) and wanted to get breakfast there first.  I've had it there before.  I was told by the hostess that I couldn't eat there because they would provide me a breakfast through the convention.  It was pretty amazing to hear that!  I asked her, ""So I can't eat here?""  She then rolled her eyes and told me to check the touch screen device behind me if I didn't know where I was going.  I took a few deep breaths and just left feeling extremely minimized.  It was so sad to see such poor customer service over something that shouldn't have happened.  I'm sure no one will contact me since I doubt anyone reads these, but if you are reading this and would like more info, please reach out.  My email is mattdraheim1@gmail.com if you would like to reach out.",Positive,,,,,
"James at checkout was very efficient and welcoming 
A true professional made me feel at home.",Positive,,,,,
Was not a fan that I had to pay for parking.,Negative,,,,,
333 bar closed at 10 pm when online stated midnight. Need more food options available throughout the day.,Positive,,,,,
Jett Martin was VERY helpful!,Positive,,,,,
"Please do not charge for parking. (Hide the charge someplace else)
It's bad PR to list an additional  charge for parking at your location if I'm  staying with you.",Positive,,,,,
"The hotel staff were not able to provide us with on time check in, nor an estimate of when our hotel would be available. As we discussed this, they told me I shouldnâ€™t have been able to book the room and that â€œall of the other guests have been very accommodatingâ€, which to me suggested that I as the guest was expected to accommodate the hotel rather than the other way around. They also thought sending an email notifying me that my room wouldnâ€™t be available was sufficient and that made the situation acceptable. We eventually realized that their rationale for not having available rooms was that the 49ers team was staying at the hotel. However, they were all staying on the 3rd and 4th floors of the hotel. They eventually checked us into our hotel not long after we arrived, but our hotel was in the 2nd floor so we were confused why there was a delay at all related to the team. At a minimum I would have expected that they would have offered us a free beverage at the bar while we wait or something. They were just a lot less concerned about us as guests than I usually experience at hotels.",Positive,,,,,
Took 7 hours to check in and still payed full price. I will make sure my family and friends will never stay here.,Neutral,,,,,
Hot lunch options would be nice,Negative,,,,,
We come every year in conjunction with our UPCI Mid-winter Camp event and it is always a nice experience.,Positive,,,,,
Paid parking too small toilets and too low to floor,Positive,,,,,
"Please clean the air vents in room, and the shower.
The one in the shower was awful",Positive,,,,,
Everyone is so friendly thank you for that,Positive,,,,,
"excellent place to stay, Hyatt personnel went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of.  We will definately be back",Positive,,,,,
I like to get a refund for both nights.,Positive,,,,,
I believe Dental Associates was to pay for the room. Will check,Negative,,,,,
"The few things we noticed the duvet was ripping bad, the bathroom and room were getting pretty dated and could use some sprucing up. The vent rattled really bad and kept waking us up at night.",Negative,,,,,
"The staff is very friendly and helpful! I got dinner from the restaurant and it was good and had great flavor. The room I stayed had a few problems. The carpet is coming up at the bathroom door, the bathroom sink is cracked and a couple of tiles are cracked in the bathroom. Other than that I was very pleased with my stay!",Positive,,,,,
"The staff was very friendly and effective. In particular Katherine at the front desk ( I believe that was her 1st name). She was very helpful explaining everything as I was getting registered in my room, and helping with any other request I had. I was pleased with her assistance.",Positive,,,,,
I expected the staff to be good. Thatâ€™s why I didnâ€™t rate higher.,Positive,,,,,
"We were there for a Packers game.  2 nights (required) came to almost $1000.  At that cost, I'd expect top notch EVERYTHING.  The hotel is generally a little rough around the edges, the carpet in our room should be restretched or replaced, the elevator is slower than the stairs, the doors on the armoire didn't close, the window was filthy with peeling window tint, the bed covering didn't fit/cover the mattresses properly, the sheets had tears in them, etc",Negative,,,,,
My son had his wedding reception there! Very accommodating,Neutral,,,,,
"Leave more washcloths, coffee pods, and cups.",Negative,,,,,
Was not recognized as a Discoverist and I had to request the comp bottles of water,Neutral,,,,,
"Waitresses weren't the friendliest and 2 times I was served creamer that expired in October and was sour (I was visible that it had gone bad even without opening). 
When I am nice about it and you bring me new coffee, but no new creamer, then you bring me creamer and of the 5, 4 of them are expired... that's a problem.",Negative,,,,,
We were completely disappointed by the enforcement of hotel COVID policies amongst its guests.,Negative,,,,,
Great and helpful staff,Positive,,,,,
A maintenance man walked in on me while I was undressed. The situation was addressed by front desk staff and manager.,Neutral,,,,,
"We were not told that we had to use our room key to get out of the parking lot. Drake, said he would re-emburise us. But I received my receipt and he did not. However he did let us check in earlier than 4pm, so it all washes out I guess.",Positive,,,,,
Had a fantastic stay here!!! Staff did an amazing job and also so friendly!! Looking forward to coming back again.,Positive,,,,,
"The $100 fee for bringing our dog was very steep!  The most I have ever seen as an adder was $50, and it's typically much lower than that or there is no fee at all.  Unfortunately, I had already booked and paid through Hotwire so I couldn't cancel the reservation, otherwise I would have and found somewhere without such a high fee!  Overall, we were very happy with the hotel itself though.",Negative,,,,,
Great stay,Positive,,,,,
facility is a bit dated,Neutral,,,,,
The parking issue.,Positive,,,,,
You just need more free snacks in the lobby. Like good free snacks. Aside from that your hotel was beyond amazing. The rooms were much bigger than almost any room I have stayed in and I travel a ton. If I am ever back I am staying with you.,Positive,,,,,
Very surprised you charge for parking,Neutral,,,,,
The window runners should really be cleaned. They were filthy.,Negative,,,,,
Room felt dated. Sheer curtain had at least one large rip in it. Ceiling dirty in front of HVAC vent. Room layout was odd and felt shoved in a corner. Elevators incredibly slow.,Negative,,,,,
I wish breakfast was more reasonably priced.,Positive,,,,,
"We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food in the pub especially the house-smoked wings. Breakfast buffet was good if a little pricey. I adore the 24-hour coffee and snacks...a real comfort and bonus for us early risers. The atrium is a little dark and dated, could use some brightening. But we love the hotel overall and it's our base for Packer games and other trips to the area.",Positive,,,,,
Children could not sleep due to the fact there was a huge party with a very bad live cover band going on in the lobby.,Negative,,,,,
There were ants in my towels we got from the pool.,Neutral,,,,,
"Great hotel, staff was very helpful and friendly",Positive,,,,,
I just told my Parents to stay there for this upcoming packer game. THey just booked!,Positive,,,,,
Will definitely stay again.,Positive,,,,,
The food in restraurant was good. I would have liked more options.,Positive,,,,,
We enjoy staying at your facility and would like to have friends and family from the area meet us there for beverages or a meal. Please reconsider your policy regarding charging for use of your parking lot. We are likely to walk to a neighborhood establishment to meet friends rather than ask them to pay to park in the lot at the hotel.,Positive,,,,,
I've stayed at other Hyatt Regency's and feel this is not up to par for the brand. I think this should be rebranded as another Hyatt hotel.,Neutral,,,,,
"Room needs update. Carpet in room
Needs to be restretched or replaced.",Negative,,,,,
House keeping took pics of ripped curtain on check in and brought hand soap,Negative,,,,,
The room of course was perfect. But when we walked into the hotel and saw the beautiful Christmas tree it just took our breath away. The lady at the front desk was happy and so helpful. We participated in the local winter wine and beer walk and so the location of the hotel was absolutely perfect. We will stay at the Hyatt Regency again. Thank you for never disappointing us!,Positive,,,,,
We ate in Pub Friday night. Food was terrible but hated to scold the waitress as she seemed very nervous and she didnt cook the meal. We both had fish and chips and mine was so overcooked not edible and my wifes was terribly undercooked and close to raw.  Obviously frozen and deep fried.  Bad,Negative,,,,,
"The front desk associate was just ""as expected."" She had little personality. The young lady working the restaurant was superb. Very polite, and friendly.",Positive,,,,,
"There was some noise on the second floor from some piece of equipment it appeared.  However, good Hyatt stay.",Positive,,,,,
Nice rooms very clean and functional. Only down side is the bathrooms are small.,Positive,,,,,
"Hotel definitely has some age on it and could use a refresh, but overall acceptable and clean.  Requested items were brought up to room quickly.  Always someone at front desk.  Appeciated the Packers game inspired ""tailgate"" activities.  Also liked that parking was on site and easy, even though there was an extra, unnecessary charge.  Did not appreciate lack of free basic breakfast, or that optional breakfast buffet was $25 per person one morning.  Just stop the nickel/diming - because of this I would suggest someone check other places first.",Positive,,,,,
Room was not cleaned after the first night and new towels were not delivered.,Positive,,,,,
great,Positive,,,,,
"When entering the suite, it gives a darker vibe than a lot of other hotels Iâ€™ve stayed at. Brighter lights, lighter colors not sure how to best improve.",Positive,,,,,
Thought $24 for breakfast seemed expensive so we ate elsewhere. The accommodations and staff were excellent,Positive,,,,,
Update badly needed.  Everything old.    Owners need to invest.  Honestly shocked this property is a Hyatt Regency.  Looks like an old 70/80's Embassy Suites that didn't get much of an update when purchased.,Negative,,,,,
Buffet is too expensive,Negative,,,,,
It would be nice to provide bottled water for the occupants.,Positive,,,,,
The Sunday breakfast buffet is badly overpriced. You were charging top dollar for an IHOP breakfast.. And there was not enough seating for us,Negative,,,,,
Only criticism is that the elevators were painfully slow.,Negative,,,,,
"There is no restaurant at this hotel just a sports Bar serving a limited menu of  Burghers.
Also the beer on Tap was not available as listed. Very limited choices which means if one want a decent meal one has to leave the hotel, and in the winter in Green Bay this is not a good option.",Positive,,,,,
Breakfast and breakfast staff were great. Every other Hyatt I stayed at covered the entire tip of the fee breakfast.  I tipped 20% ($8 tip) and my credit card was charged $5 for the gratuity.  Not much but it is the principal of it.,Positive,,,,,
Awesome place! Comfy Beds!,Positive,,,,,
Special thanks to Megan Diamond for going the extra step assisting me!,Positive,,,,,
I was extremely pleased with the accommodations and have already recommended this location to my colleagues and will continue to do so.,Positive,,,,,
"The name Hyatt implies a certain standard that wasnâ€™t met. The staff was friendly, cheerful and helpful, but the condition of the room (718) was disappointing to say the least.",Positive,,,,,
The person at the front desk when we checked out on Saturday morning was very enthusiastic and especially helpful.,Positive,,,,,
"Once we cooled down the room, quality of room was ok, but lack of shuttle, lack of early morning coffee made this just a place to crash.  Not really meet my expectations for a hotel.",Positive,,,,,
The staff at restaurant was great and friendly!,Positive,,,,,
The pool was cloudy. Not sure it was being maintained properly.,Positive,,,,,
Are room was clean but in the bathroom they must of fixed a light and are still in the process of fixing it because it was a hole in the ceiling with a light bulb. It worked for what we needed it for. Otherwise very satisfied,Positive,,,,,
Bathmats in the tub/shower would be helpful to prevent falls.  In our bathroom everything was provided for including bathing products but no mat to put down in the bathtub.,Positive,,,,,
We tried to call hotel to see if they served food for dinner but no one at front desk answered the phone after a couple of attempts.,Negative,,,,,
Enjoy bringing our conference to your hotel and convention facility.  It fits our needs well.  Would like to have more flexibility with state rate menus to provide more options and beverages with actual meal instead of having to purchase separately. Buffet meals work much better with our group....the plated breakfast seemed to be more work for hotel staff and also in keeping food warm for participants.  But the plated option provided a better selection of breakfast for our participants.  Please consider a Buffet option for breakfast and if staff needs to help serve to control portion size...this would be better than a plated service.  Thank you for allowing us to bring in donated milk.,Positive,,,,,
Breakfast buffet very expensive for what it was.,Positive,,,,,
"I loved the bar it was so lively! It was an added bonus to have the tail gate party the nite before the game. For out of towners, it was really impressive especially the band!",Positive,,,,,
"I've been coming to this hotel for years even before it was the Hyatt. Only thing I'd like to see different is having the social happy hour back in the concourse  like Regency did, otherwise everything was amazing",Positive,,,,,
Most everything was nice.  I would suggest adding additional caulking in the bathroom so it doesn't look so old.  Shower and tile were nice.  Beds were comfortable.,Positive,,,,,
Incredibly nice staff,Positive,,,,,
Please see above.,Negative,,,,,
The room on the 8th floor was way too warm but thankfully your staff came through to make it cooler.,Positive,,,,,
Elevators are way to slow,Negative,,,,,
The front desk staff was very helpful.,Positive,,,,,
I just want to say thank you to everyone including housekeeping who made sure that we had everything that we need to be comfortable.,Positive,,,,,
I did not like that the housekeeper knocked once then opened the door,Positive,,,,,
"Had a wonderful stay and would be happy to stay longer if I ever need to.  The facility does show some wear here and there, nothing major or worth specifically calling out.  Overall everything for my stay was great",Positive,,,,,
The suite was very spacious.,Positive,,,,,
The fact that there are no vending machines is very irritating and the prices in the Market were ridiculously high. A tiny like 3oz bag of goldfish or a snack size bag of chips should not be $5+ some things $7 that would cost $2.50 at a store.  Not to mention pudding cups that are $8.50...a box of pudding is $1. I got 5 waters and 5 TINY snacks and it was $47...that's absolutely outrageous.,Negative,,,,,
The roomâ€™s temperature is set too high.,Neutral,,,,,
Only issue we had was eating at the restaurant in the lobby and myself and another family were charged double our bill. After realizing this a hour after dinner we went back to discuss this with waitstaff and bartender and all we were told was it will get fixed and that this happens all the time. Kind of makes me upset that they staff knows this is an issue but no one is informed that this can happen. The issue has still not been fixed.,Positive,,,,,
"On October 7th I made a reservation for 4 rooms. I made it in person at the Hyatt. I had very specific requests. I reserved 1 deluxe suite with connecting studio suite. The other 2 room suites next door to the connecting room.  
When I checked in the deluxe suite with connecting room wasn't booked. 
The 4 rooms were , 1 studio suite  2 suites ( next door but not connected). The 4th room was going to 4floors away. I canceled the 4th room. Then I had to return to the desk to exchange the studio suite for a regular suite.",Positive,,,,,
"Beautiful place, friendly staff. We will be back.",Positive,,,,,
Parking was confusing. There were not enough spots and it wasnâ€™t clear what to do if a spot wasnâ€™t available for you.,Positive,,,,,
"Great stay, staff is amazing. The only thing i would recommend is make sure to vacuum and check under the sofa i had dropped a earing and noticed some things left behind under there.  Other than that great stay and with the great staff you have we will be back again!",Positive,,,,,
It was nice that I was notified that the parking lot would not be available via an email.  I was then not notified that the construction was push back and the lot was available again.,Positive,,,,,
It would be nice to have a good restaurant instead of a bar/grill,Positive,,,,,
I expected a corner room to have views in two directions.,Negative,,,,,
Was told I had to park in the ramp Iâ€™m like ok. Then the front desk called my room told me that was a mistake and I would be reimbursed for the city charge of parking in the ramp and a 25% off a future stay. When checking out was told nothing could be done about the parking and I should have said something before checking out now mind you we were talking as he was checking me out. Already being stressed about going to my brothers funeral I said screw it and just walked away knowing he was doing nothing for me.  Thanks Steve,Positive,,,,,
"Multiple nights during my stay, the parking lot was full, and I had to park across the street. It wasn't clear that I could park there, the front desk had to tell me. I had to ask to have my parking charges removed for those days since I couldn't use the parking I paid for. It seems silly to have to pay to park when there's decent street parking around and it's Green Bay.... no reason I should pay money to park.",Positive,,,,,
"Ordered two Brandy Manhattan was shocked to pay $30
Other than than our stay was Great!",Negative,,,,,
Will never stay there again.,Negative,,,,,
Loved the buffet breakfast the day of the Packer game. We also really loved the 2 room suite & the restaurant/fitness center was excellent.,Positive,,,,,
Everything was great! The bathroom by the pool area needed some attention after someone left it a mess. We let the front desk know and within 5 minutes they had a janitor in there. The breakfast in the morning was fantastic too.,Positive,,,,,
"I am writing to express my disappointment with my recent stay at your hotel. Unfortunately, the experience did not meet the expectations set by the high cost of the room.

Upon arrival, I was greeted by a front entrance lobby under construction, which immediately set the tone for the stay. Further, the view from my room was far from pleasant, overlooking an unattractive area. While I understand the hotel's proximity to an industrial zone, this does not justify the lack of effort to provide a more appealing aspect, especially given the room rate.

The overall experience felt lackluster, especially considering the premium I paid for the room. This disparity between cost and value has left me feeling taken advantage of. The expense, on all fronts, was irksome, to say the least.  

I regret to inform you that because of this experience, I have decided not to return to your hotel. Additionally, I am considering writing a more detailed and realistic review of my stay, to share my experience with others.  As a business leader myself, I understand the pressure we all face to remain profitable but your rates are way out of line in my view.  

I hope my feedback helps you improve the experience for future guests in some way.",Positive,,,,,

Lack of parking in hotel lot on last night of my stay.. ramp across the street was almost filled too..,Negative,,,,,
Available parking at the hotel was a problem. Public ramps close by but my wife is not very mobil and did not favor the walk.,Positive,,,,,
Nice quiet stay!,Positive,,,,,
"Last year breakfast was covered.  This year all the person did at the front was mark two hash marks on a notepad and said we could go in, never mentioned a  cost and never wrote our room number down.  When we checked out there was a $27 charge for breakfast on the bill.  The breakfast was low quality and certainly not worth anywhere near that.  You need to be more clear",Positive,,,,,
"The service at the pub was terrible. After waiting 20+ min for our food when it wasn't very busy, we were told there was a ""mix-up"" with our order. 
It took another 25 min for our food to finally arrive while others came in after and left before we had received our food.",Positive,,,,,
Unexpected extra loud noise,Negative,,,,,
Conference center is too far away and was VERY cold.  No water was provided.,Positive,,,,,
My room was fantastic. Beautiful river views - thank you!,Positive,,,,,
$50 credit hold is wrong 5 day delay for refund,Negative,,,,,
I needed a toiletry item and it was delivered asap. My room service dinner was horrible. I had the beef and bleu flatbread. It was topped with 100% pieces of fat instead of beef and was tasteless. I also had the boubon bread pudding. It was missing the ice cream and topped with these super hard nuggets and wasn't good. I was baffled how a dessert could be messed up. Very expensive and tasteless dinner.,Negative,,,,,
The only thing is I wish that I would of been accommodate due to the misleading info and charging me twice on the last day after I told a different person that I b paying for late check out. I also never got reimbursed or corrected food that ordered thru pub as soggy and disgusting felt like the lady or waiter got upset wit me,Positive,,,,,
Thank you for extending great rate for 'block' a day before and after!!,Positive,,,,,
"Would have loved to have room service available from the restaurant, or for breakfast.",Positive,,,,,
"Concert in the lobby was really loud, even though it had a very small audience. We couldnâ€™t use the living room part of the suite at all on Saturday evening.",Negative,,,,,
"Very old hotel. Shame to the Hyatt brand. Also, charging your loyal travelers an ""early departure"" fee to check out early when plans change is certainly no way to retain my business. This does not happen at Marriott or Hilton, I guess they care more about catering to business travelers.",Negative,,,,,
We were told that the two room we booked were connected - they were not!   So we had to make due with one room - because they were not able to stay in a room by themselves!  So we had to pay for a room that we didn't use - as they were non-refundable - which IF they had been connecting rooms that would have been FINE.  The Hotel did not stand up to their end of the reservation -so we should have gotten our money back for the one room we couldn't use!!!,Positive,,,,,
"Overall, the hotel is quite dated and could benefit from renovations.",Positive,,,,,
The elevators were very slow and we have to wait a long time for the elevators to arrive. There were two sets of elevators on each side of the building but it seems theyâ€™re programmed to go up and down at the same time. Itâ€™s not efficient and it causes delays for us guests.,Negative,,,,,
"Hi there.  I'm very disappointed with our stay at the Hyatt in Green Bay.  We booked this room months in advance. We got married at Hyatt Baha mar and we were excited to stay at another Hyatt while visiting Green Bay for the Packers football game.

 

We arrived and the room was at 78 degrees, and were told we could not change the temperature of the room. That is simply unacceptable to expect patrons to sleep in a room thatâ€™s 78 degrees! They offered us a fan. After further complaining, they â€œallowed usâ€ to move to another room. At midnight after arriving we were given another room and after already unpacking, we had to repack and move to another roomâ€¦ only to arrive in a room that was ALSO 78 degrees without temperature control. Why would the hotel do that to us? Inconvenience us only to have the same issue?  Why were we not allowed to control the temperature in our rooms?  

 

We also didnâ€™t have a comforter in the room nor did we have body wash in the shower. When we called to ask for a simple comforter, we were told â€œcomforters are limited right now so weâ€™ll see what we can doâ€.  A comforter was never provided to us.  How is it that a HYATT hotel doesnâ€™t have enough comforters for its guests?? This is truly shocking and unacceptable.

 

The BASICS of a hotel room are to provide a temperature controlled room, a bed with a comforter and a shower with basic body washâ€¦ we didnâ€™t get ANY of the above!  We stuck it out three nights because we were FORCED to being that it was a Packers football home game day weekend and there was no availability elsewhere but we were very disappointed in our experience and very frustrated that we had to use our points for such a negative experience.  We request a full refund of the points we used for this booking, and additional points because of this terrible experience.

You should not charge for parking at a hotel in Green Bay.,Neutral,,,,,
Gentleman from housekeeping was very nice and apologetic.,Positive,,,,,
I wouldnâ€™t be taken advantage like that again. I wouldnâ€™t have stayed with you if I had made the reservation.,Positive,,,,,
I LOVE that the sliding doors can open to let in fresh air. The restaurant had too much fragrance; seemed like plug-ins were used and it was too strong. Suggest including silverware for kitchenettes.,Positive,,,,,
I had the do not disturb sign on my door and houskeeping entered.,Negative,,,,,
"The hotel was very nice, it was a bit tired looking. Items such as counters, appliances, fixtures, and furnishings looked worn out.  There was also a bit of garbage (paper and crumbs) on my floor that had been left from previous guests.",Negative,,,,,
Very noisy in the courtyard area with live music and games. Was unaware of the tailgate party going on.,Negative,,,,,
Over experience was an 8/10. Where you could improve is providing a better services for getting coffee in the morning. The lady at the coffee shop left to get supplies and use the bathroom and there was No assistance from one for 30min. I left and got coffee elsewhere. How is that possible? Room coffee was not what I was looking for.,Positive,,,,,
I ended up in the same room I stayed in 2 years ago.  The office type chair that is in that room had a weird stain on it two years ago and it was still there.,Negative,,,,,
"Very nice hotel, but a bit older. This impacted the experience.  Did not live up to what I expected from a Hyatt Regency, in particular.",Positive,,,,,
Very disappointed that such a large hotel - connected to a convention center - does not have any breakfast offerings (except the bar),Positive,,,,,
"I did not request any housekeeping services; however, the staff stopped by daily to check to see if I needed assistance.",Neutral,,,,,
Very comfortable and clean experience. No issues.,Positive,,,,,
"The pool and hot tub area were very nice; although the tree in the entrance to pool area should be moved towards the column instead. Yes, it's not in the hallway in front of the door, but it is within the direct walking path of the door from the elevators. Also, it would be nice if there were an additional towel area in the pool so you don't have to walk across to the other side if you're only visiting the hot tub area.",Positive,,,,,
After the heavy rains at 4:32AM my room was filled with a sewage stench not from the bathroom but seemingly the 2 drain vents outside my windor (it was horrible!),Negative,,,,,
The bill was figured incorrectly for two of the rooms we stayed in.  It took quite a long time to get them fixed.  Ashleigh worked on clearing up someone else's mistake.,Negative,,,,,
"Great overall experience!  This is the first hotel I have stayed in since the pandemic, and it was very comfortable and clean.",Positive,,,,,
Breakfast meal service was poor.,Positive,,,,,
"Hotel is pretty run down and dated. Also, donâ€™t get room near street side as is very noisy.",Neutral,,,,,
We were charged $10 per day for parkingâ€¦and I wasnâ€™t able to park in the lot Saturdayâ€¦.it was full.  I had to park in a lot across the streetâ€¦not sure who owned it.,Positive,,,,,
"I booked the hotel via Booking.com
1. It said parking was private. No mention of any cost. I was surprised to hear about cost when I checked it. It was waived
2. It said that there is breakfast for $15. There was none, only a- la -cart
3. My flight was canceled several times. I asked to book until October 22 and told the person at the reception that because of the situation (I am from Israel), the check-out date might be changed. Eventually I checked out on Oct 21. It was outraging when the receptionist told me I would need to pay a penalty for early checking out, after I stayed in your hotel for 12 days! I travel a lot. I have been to hundreds hotels around the world. Nobody ever asked me for any penalty for early check-out. Never! Fortunately, the manager at this shift waived it. 
4. I don't understand how a hotel of 4 stars which offers itself to business people doesn't have a safety box. It is a must.  
5. The noisy room I was offered first, the time I waited for your maintenance guy, his dishonest answer about the noisy fan in the room (it is like that in all rooms), the surprise about the parking and the breakfast, contrary to the offer in Booking.com and the requirement of early check-out penalty and lack of deposit box  will explain why I may not recommend your hotel to others, in-spite of my very good room (after moving), the pool and the jacuzzi, the location and the help of some of the receptionist and the manager who helped sorting out some issues (I am sorry I don't know his name. There was another manager who when I complained, on the second or third day of my stay, about the above she boldly offered me to check out...)",Positive,,,,,
We have come for the past several years and have been wowed every time. James is an amazing leader! You are so lucky to have him! He worked side by side with his staff to make sure the work got done. My sisters and I love it there! We will be back!,Positive,,,,,
For the price a person pays there could be either a discounted breakfast or continental. Also the parking is terrible. I came back from an outing and there was no parking!,Negative,,,,,
"Everyone at the front desk was kind and helpful, thank you",Positive,,,,,
The furniture could use an update! The sliding door window was filthy with hand and forehead prints. Our stay was perfectly fine overall. Just some suggestions!,Positive,,,,,
"Good facility and location for our conference, Iâ€™m always pleased with my stay there.",Positive,,,,,
"The only issue:  the toilet in our room was too low.  Really, all rooms should have high-rise seats.  Ours was very appropriate for my 5 year-old granddaughter.",Positive,,,,,
Could use more hook(s) for clothes/towels in bathroom.,Neutral,,,,,
Not staying again.,Negative,,,,,
We have been work with Hyatt for over 20 years here and the service is always top shelf!,Positive,,,,,
Room and staff was great. Don't change a thing.,Positive,,,,,
The overall building itself is old. You can tell money was put in to update the decor of the rooms but it definitely has a dated feel to the structure of the building. My room was on the main street and the windows did not do much to dampen the sound (5th floor). The heating/cooling system wasn't easily controlled. I wanted to run a fan to dampen the noise but that was not an option. The lightly was dim. The front room with kitchen was nice and the room was very clean. I guess I just expected a little more from a Hyatt.,Positive,,,,,
This was a nice hotel.  There were a few things in the bathroom that weren't super clean; baseboards weren't clean but that wasn't a game change.  The rest of the room was clean and nice.  The bed was very comfortable.,Positive,,,,,
Consider sound proofing outdoor windows more.  Outside traffic can be loud.  The thicker the proofing the better experience for all people who sleep there.,Positive,,,,,
The bar service was very slow and inattentive on Wednesday and Thursday nights,Negative,,,,,
No one told me breakfast ended at 10. When i showed up at 1002 the heavyset server told me no.  Weird,Positive,,,,,
Rooms looked a little outdated.,Negative,,,,,
You need to update your tax exemption form.  I provided them with my tax exemption form but they didn't accept it.,Positive,,,,,
"We were told that the room key would get us out for parking. Was expected that we wouldnâ€™t pay for parking with the overnight, but the key didnâ€™t work and we needed to pay $12 to get out. That is our only complaint.",Negative,,,,,
It was the best â€œBig Night Outâ€. Thank you,Positive,,,,,
The rooms need updating.  Look old.  Small tvs,Neutral,,,,,
"We thought you had a full breakfast.
We appreciated the early check in to ready for the wedding.  Too bad we had to leave early the next morning and not get to use the pool. Pub and all staff were very pleasant.",Positive,,,,,
"Great rooms, love the handy lobby market, and all the staff were very communicative and pleasant to work with!",Positive,,,,,
Hotel needs to be renovated and upgraded. Not a good representation of the Hyatt brand.,Positive,,,,,
Too many small kids in hot tub.,Positive,,,,,
Parking was terrible.,Negative,,,,,
More parking needed - should be free - and rooms need to be cleaner,Positive,,,,,
UNDERSTAFFED RESTAURANT - I was extremely disappointed with dinner. I ordered a simple dish - chicken tenders and french fries. I could not finish either because the tenders were severely overcooked and the fries were undercooked. There was one waitress/host who was also tending bar and training a new bar tender. I did not send my meal back because she was too busy to come over to check on me/the meal. I finally got her attention when I was ready to leave and it still took a while to get the check and total out my meal. The drink (Captain Punch) also was not good. I did not finish it. I had less than half of it when I knew I could not finish it.,Positive,,,,,
"I'm still very intrigued by the four elevators on hydraulic cylinders... did seem a little impractical for going up to the 8th floor, plus that seems like a lot of oil that has to be cooled frequently, but it was cool to see overall",Positive,,,,,
"Check in and check out weâ€™re extremely quick and easy. Everyone staff related was friendly, very impressed especially being there for 2.5 days with seminars.",Positive,,,,,
Love the addition of the dog area with waste bags,Positive,,,,,
.Property is well maintained,Positive,,,,,
Had a breakfast but they have not taken order more than 20 minutes and missed some of the food ordered and food was not upto the mark.,Positive,,,,,
"Room pricing needs adjustment. Corner room should be less expensive than regular 2 room suite, not more. One thinks of view in two directions when in corner - is not. Corner is one room, not two. One 42"" TV, not 65"" TV in both rooms as standard suite. Granite counters in standard two room suite.",Negative,,,,,
We will probably stay at the nearby Hampton Inn on our next trip to Green Bay because they offer EV  charging.,Positive,,,,,
Get diet coke not just Pepsi lol,Positive,,,,,
"There was a constant hum in the room. I wasnâ€™t sure where it was coming from maybe the a/c but even after turning it off, the hum was still there. 
Suggest PUB333 menu to have more variety and make it upscale without raising prices. Should be competitive with what is available around neighborhood.",Positive,,,,,
"We were in room 801 and there was a sewer-y odor coming from the cabinet below the microwave. I would have notified the front desk, however it took me until we were doing the final check on our way out, and I was not present when my husband checked us out.",Positive,,,,,
"Overall, it was a great experience. Our room was a bit beat up and toilet paper as cheap as it comes. The staff were fantastic though and the lobby is beautiful.",Positive,,,,,
The fitness center was nicer than anticipated. I appreciate that.,Positive,,,,,
I think a complimentary breakfast would be nice Most hotels offer this and rooms are less expensive,Positive,,,,,
I checked in the evening of 10/6/23 and the person helping me was excellent.,Positive,,,,,
omelet station is missed,Negative,,,,,
I asked for a military discount and they said they couldnâ€™t do it because I didnâ€™t schedule it like that. But I hadnâ€™t paid yet I paid when I got to the hotel and they were not able to provide me a military discount. I would stilll like one if at all possible,Positive,,,,,
Perhaps more hooks on the walls in the bathroom would be a nice and helpful addition. ðŸ˜Š,Positive,,,,,
Only drawback was a severe fear of heights made the elevator ride difficult as well as getting to the room with balcony close on one side. 7th floor room,Negative,,,,,
I had to ask for our waters at check in but they remembered me on our second day.,Positive,,,,,
No parking for anyone more or less the handicapped,Negative,,,,,
"Found a blanket to use in closet but blood stains were on it, left out to be replaced next day but it was not. Carpet stretched and pulling up. Baseboards dirt/dust thick around carpet. Sheets on bed had black grease stains. Balcony door would not shut tight, had to be pushed from top of door to get to latch. Door frame was very dirty.",Negative,,,,,
"The staff, the breakfast abs the hotel are great. My only complaint is the temperature. It's a tough time of year, I get that, but our room thermostat did not work. It consistently heated the room to 72 degrees, even when ""off"". My wife and I sleep well at about 65, and not so well at 72. We did try leaving the balcony door open, but with no screen, we weren't comfortable that bugs might come in. It would be nice to actually control the thermostat and set the room temperature to our desired sleeping temperature. The bed was comfy but we did not sleep great because of the high temperature.",Positive,,,,,
"Very disappointing that if your room is ready and your guests arrive early, especially after a long drive, they are unable to check in early unless they pay a fee.  This affected some good friends of ours who arrived around 11:00am from a 5 hour drive but couldnâ€™t check in without paying a fee.  This is ridiculous",Negative,,,,,
"We have a freshman at UWGB so plan on visiting many times over the next four year. Loved the layout of the rooms and the size.  At check was told that parking would be reduced from $10 to $5 but was charged $10 on my bill.  Overall, great!",Positive,,,,,
Had a fabulous stay only wish I would have had more time to stay and enjoy the pool area,Positive,,,,,
"I just got a last minute room on Hotwire, and wasn't even sure it would have a real bed.  The room description said sofa bed.  Before pulling the trigger, I called to meka sure it had an actual bed.  It did, and so I booked it.  The front desk staff placed me in a very nice two queen bed w/sofa suite.  I was very surprised and pleased at their generosity",Positive,,,,,
"This was our first time lodging at Hyatt Regency and overall, very satisfied with customer service and cleanliness of hotel. The only disappointment was that there were no complimentary breakfast, which my children were very looking forward to.",Positive,,,,,
Some of the doors in the bathroom are not hanging correctly causing some doors to not close and unable to lock the door on others.,Positive,,,,,
"I stayed for two nights there arriving on a Saturday night and checking out Monday morning. I received good service and once my room was changed, it was a good experience. One thing I appreciated was that the staff was helpful when I discovered I had left a shirt behind and the front desk contacted housekeeping who went and retrieved the shirt left behind. I have a mixed review on another situation. With an hour or so of being in my room, I heard extremely loud music and noise coming from my neighboring room (and connecting) and went downstairs to let them know. They decided to move my room rather than address the problem (I'm sure these situations are difficult) but I was surprised that they made me check out first from my eighth floor room and bring my luggage downstairs again in their busy and slower elevators (it was a busy Saturday night there) and then get a new key and return to my new eighth floor room. It would have seemed providing me with a new key card to the room would have made more sense and allowed me to return the old room after moving my stuff. But I was glad I was allowed to move to a much quieter room. I also found that the hotel lobby and room hallways were very noisy with teenagers running up and down and taking the elevators. After Saturday night that problem was gone also.",Positive,,,,,
"I attend conferences for work in various cities in the state and this one is my favorite. The conference center is always clean.  
The wifi is a bit confusing moving between the room and conference center.  
The double room I was in had a large TV in the bedroom area and was really nice.  Clean comfy room. Because it's an older building some damage to walls is noticeable in bathrooms and it would be nice to see this fixed. 
The thing I like least is the small toilets in the rooms. The bowl is so small!? I would love to see upgraded toilets. 
Overall I really enjoy the stay every year at this Hyatt.",Positive,,,,,
"Carpet glue is on the inside door frame, toilet flushed very slow.",Negative,,,,,
You may want to evaluate the toilet paper. It was next to sand paper grade.,Positive,,,,,
"After checking in there were three large purchases on my credit card the following morning,.  When I checked out and explained a new card was to be used for additional charges and I explained why, the reception did not even acknowledge the inconvenience I had cancelling my credit card.  Additionally another receptionist was at the desk, they did not have any words of exchange, although one left in our presence.  It was a very cold atmosphere, unlike check in that was great!",Positive,,,,,
"The rooms can definitely use an upgrade.  Everything was a bit dark and dingy, the carpet in my room had a large ripple where it wasnâ€™t connected to the floor, just not what I would expect for the cost.  The lobby area is nice but the room didnâ€™t match that atmosphere.",Positive,,,,,
"We were to remember my son who used to love coming here for the breakfast, he has passed now, so we just wanted to savor the memories.",Positive,,,,,
The hotel is a bit tired but the staff was great and the room was clean,Positive,,,,,
"Upon check in they forgot to give us our wedding welcome bag, as we were  able to get later when we asked.",Positive,,,,,
Always nice stay at the Hyatt. I miss the breakfast buffet,Positive,,,,,
I do not think I will recommend GB Hyatt Regency to any friends or family. Very disappointed.,Positive,,,,,
"Staff was incredibly kind and helpful, including helping us locate a sweatshirt I accidentally left behind. Hotel itself seems a little tired thoughâ€¦carpet in room is very wavy & worn, decor is dated. Things were clean, but everything could use a refresh.",Positive,,,,,
The pillows are AMAZING!,Positive,,,,,
The rooms should be ready at the check in.  I should have to change my accommodations because your staff could not prep the room in a timely manner.,Positive,,,,,
"Parking tickets you receive when coming into the hotel parking lot, not taking the ticket when leaving, or telling us hotel guests we need to pay to leave.",Negative,,,,,
My new favorite place,Positive,,,,,
"Only was disappointed with the restaurant.  Breakfast came out like warm, and paper straws are the worst",Positive,,,,,
"Staff very friendly, helpful and tentative.",Positive,,,,,
Parking was very confusing.  In one area it was complimentary but there wasnt enough for everyone.  If you offer free parking to some guests it should be offered to all.  I was asked to park in the public parking garage across the street.  Perhaps Hyatt could offer the same parking arrangement there as they do in the complimentary parking.,Positive,,,,,
"This property is starting to show its old age with no improvements. Furniture in the room was broken, lights burnt out, and dated room appliances.",Positive,,,,,
Expand menu in bar!!,Positive,,,,,
"The manager the next day was attentive and gave me her card. The conference made sure that my room was paid for and my credit card was not charged. However, upon receive the invoice for zero charge my Discover card was charged a second charge of $341 after the $441 was returned. Overall, the attention to detail and customer service is very sad.",Positive,,,,,
Clean the windows on the outside. YUCK SPIDERS. The inside was fine. Housekeeping was pleasant and courteous.,Positive,,,,,
"Glad there was an iron and board in the room, ended up needing it badly.",Positive,,,,,
We were disappointed that we were charged $10 a day for parking. This was not listed on the app or when we checked in.,Negative,,,,,
"The only major issue was the food in the restaurant. Service and facilities were excellent but my Cheeseburger was extremely well done and tasteless for the $18.00 price. Zero complaints on the service though, the waitress was excellent as well as the host.",Positive,,,,,
Samantha was very helpful at check-in.,Positive,,,,,
"Try having free coffee and breakfast for your guest. Before booking on travel, it said free breakfast and that's why we booked. We are busy and not have time for stopping another place for breakfast.  We travel a lot on business and use lot hotels around the country. This was first time Hyatt experience in Green Bay and will be the last.",Negative,,,,,
"I did not, at all, expect a Hyatt Regency to be converted from a previous Embassy Suites hotel.  Not up to Hyatt standards!!",Positive,,,,,
"I am a Hyatt member. Before I booked my room, I called about the rate, which was extremely high compared to past stays. Unfortunately, when I booked, I did not see it was a nonrefundable rate. I have never seen a rate that was only nonrefundable. So my surprise when I was checking rates the night before our stay, I saw they were half the price of what I was paying. Nonetheless, I could not get her in adjustment even when I spoke with the manager. Very disappointing. My previous experience was that customer service was paramount. Yet the Hyatt chose charging a preferred member a double rate over customer service.",Positive,,,,,
It was a wonderful experience and the staff was wonderful,Positive,,,,,
The staff at the reception desk were very friendly and helpful.,Positive,,,,,
I got charged for parking both nights. Please remove these charges as I am a Globalist using free nights.,Positive,,,,,
The main thing that annoyed me a bit was all the road noise just outside my room. I think I would've preferred having a room on a different side of the hotel.,Positive,,,,,
Being a little older i think taller bathroom toilets would be a helpful.,Positive,,,,,
Ruby was great.,Positive,,,,,
Staff was great just the property from the parking lot and exterior all the way through to the rooms were too old and in disrepair.,Positive,,,,,
We had no housekeeping presence on Wednesday.,Negative,,,,,
Overall very noisy on the side of Main Street.  Maybe due to lack of seal on slider door,Negative,,,,,
"Had a great stay, staff were very accommodating , beds were very comfortable. But the toilets are too low. Need to be comfortable height",Positive,,,,,

"We were very impressed with the layout of the rooms, enjoyed the pool, spa, and sauna, and love the overall feel and appearance of the inside of the hotel!",Positive,,,,,
"I ordered dinner room service and there was a bug in my salad, I also came home with a suspicious looking bug bite on my arm and shoulder... very disturbed by what this was from. My room did not have any soap in the bathroom; the parking lot was completely full my entire stay; My room was located next to Main St and the road was incredibly loud all night ensuring I did not get much sleep.",Positive,,,,,
Cappet in the room had ripples in it,Neutral,,,,,
Cost seemed a bit high for time of year.,Negative,,,,,
"I really enjoyed my stay there. I had a block there for my Anniversary and had family visiting, and they loved it as well. The only thing that was a little disappointing sad that they don't have a breakfast included as I have had with them before. But overall stay was great!",Positive,,,,,
"The bathrooms were small and the shower was small, not like other Hyatts I have stayed at in the past. The hot tub in the pool did not work.",Positive,,,,,
"Chambre assez vieille, salle de bain petite.",Positive,,,,,
Staff very friendly,Positive,,,,,
Hotel is kind of dim and needs a room refresh,Positive,,,,,
"I originally booked online ahead of time with a AAA rate 100% deposit at booking. I got to the hotel only for them to tell me they don't have a room that would work for me unless I upgraded. Then they told me I never paid when I remembered seeing the charge pending back in July. I went back through my statements but couldn't find the the charge, so I ended up having to unexpectedly pay $375 on my card which ruined my budget and plans for my vacation. The system failure is at no fault to the workers but they didn't honor the original price because my new room was an ""upgrade"" even though this meant my sister was stuck sleeping on a dirty couch instead of us having a nice double queen room near an elevator like we originally asked for.",Positive,,,,,
"The Hyatt was a great stay. The room was wonderful, large, clean, and comfortable. Got a coffee and breakfast sandwich during my stay which was delicious and quick with wonderful service.",Positive,,,,,
"The rooms are always too warm, and the thermostat doesnâ€™t do anything to help!",Positive,,,,,
"Appreciated the extra hour for late checkout with no charge for being a rewards member. The room was clean, but there were some noticeable dings and scratches on the walls and floors (looked somewhat dated and worn).",Positive,,,,,
"Still waiting to hear back from James. They were going to apply my points to my meals, but it wasn't done. Never received a receipt, James was going to email it to me. Left phone messages with no reply.",Positive,,,,,
My sole complaint was the noise level of the street 6 floors below and the conduction of that noise through the windows. Perhaps you could provide a â€œwhite noise machineâ€ for light sleepers. The hotel itself was very quiet,Positive,,,,,
I feel the $100 non refundable dog charge is to much.,Neutral,,,,,
"Some extra security and monitoring is recommended. An individual who was in the hotel randomly knocked on our room door for no apparent reason while my kids and family were in the room. He did not say anything, looked inside the room, and walked off. Security was informed and they addressed the issue right away.",Positive,,,,,
The hotel is outdated. There was dust on the carpet adjacent to the balcony doors. The vents are disgustingly dirty.,Negative,,,,,
"The toilet in our room (806) seemed to be exceedingly low. Would probably be an issue for many older guests. Otherwise, we were very pleased with the accommodations.",Positive,,,,,
Need to post directions to the conference room! Took me 20 min to find the conference. No signs to help direct the attendees!,Negative,,,,,
"Miguel I think his name was, he was wonderful at checkin!!! So great!  Other checkin people were pretty good. One person Simply said I canâ€™t help you I just got hereâ€¦.that seemed a but unprofessional.",Positive,,,,,
"The door to the sauna does not close appropriately. There are areas on the top and on the side through which the heat dissipates. The pool was awesome, and I still enjoyed the sauna although it wasn't as hot as I like it to be.",Positive,,,,,
Everything was fantastic. The staff went above and beyond ensuring our attendees experienced a top notch meeting. Thank you to everyone involved!,Positive,,,,,
The overall room conditions are worn and in need of updating,Negative,,,,,
It is unacceptable to not have hand soap on the bathroom counter ... a pumper of hand lotion does not count,Negative,,,,,
"I would remove this hotel from Hyatt brand. Our room was not clean, furniture did not match and carpet was rolling (stretched).",Negative,,,,,
I expected to be treated well and we were.,Positive,,,,,
"It was advertised that you had parking. To find out ony when I checked in that it cost an additional amount is unfair. Too late to cancel or find somewhere else. The hotel felt like a dungeon. Dark and oddly arranged. Stains on the sheets and very dirty carpet. The english para Olympics team struggle with thier luggage right in front of the desk with no help from staff. By the time I made it down the slow and tempermental elevators, they had just struggled through the doors.",Negative,,,,,
Great place to stay in Green Bay!,Positive,,,,,
My stay would have been perfect if werenâ€™t for the noise. It really bothered me. During the day is fine but early mornings and late nights is not ok for kids running up and down hallways like we are at some kind of theme park.,Negative,,,,,
There should be a restaurant for breakfast/lunch,Positive,,,,,

"James checked us in and was very thorough in explaining the process, amenities, and things to do during our stay. We had a great room, enjoyed the pool, and experience great customer service when we had to ask about parking, etc. We will absolutely be back for another stay!",Positive,,,,,
Make sure to warn people that this hotel is not suitable for people with vertigo!,Negative,,,,,
Iâ€™ve stayed at this hotel countless times and unfortunately they were bedbugs this time,Negative,,,,,
"There were a lot of cob webs and spiders in the room, on the balcony, and in the lobby. The body wash bottle was completely empty and there was not even enough for the first morning. The restaurant closed at 10 and we arrived at the hotel at 10:15 from a long day. Was very disappointed that we had to order a pizza for delivery. The breakfast was a bit too pricey. Very disappointed there was not a continental breakfast option.",Positive,,,,,
I disliked that you had to pay for parking. I know it was only $10 but I never had to pay for parking at other hotels in Green Bay.,Negative,,,,,

"Attention to detail on cleaning needs to be addressed, though with late check outs and early check ins, I know that it hard to achieve.",Positive,,,,,
"My card was charged an extra $40 and when I called I was transferred to  place that was closed. It ended up changing back to the original cost later on , but it was very frustrating",Negative,,,,,
I didnâ€™t appreciate the extra $5 additional to park in their parking lot while paying already for the room,Positive,,,,,
"Nice room. Clean. However, the bed frame was exposed and no lower cover.",Positive,,,,,
"It would be nice to have a full service restaurant with room service.  Also, a gift shop.",Positive,,,,,
Embarrassing that you donâ€™t have complimentary coffee in the morning. No one has time to make it in room. Just match every other hotel chain and have a pot ready to fill up on way out the door.,Positive,,,,,
Na,Neutral,,,,,
I would not stay here again as the swimming pool and hot tub do not have adult hours. There were more than a dozen children in the pool after 10pm while their inebriated parents watched from the hot tub.,Negative,,,,,
I did not feel the design of the building was secure for guests. Anyone from the lobby can see peoples rooms with how open it was.,Positive,,,,,
"Overall our stay was good. It was disappointing that the swim pad was out of order in the pool since we have a toddler and this option was weighed into staying with you all. Additionally, the room felt dark and outdated in the front side of it. The bedroom had a large TV (over 60"") and the front sitting room had a small (under 30"") old TV on the wall across the room, the front room was another part of why we opted to stay with you all because our toddler would be able to go down for naps/sleep in the bedroom and my wife and I could still enjoy our evenings in the front room. It would have been better if the larger TV would be in the front or at least a large enough TV to fit the space.",Positive,,,,,
The TV screen in bedroom was HUGE !!  Lobby was clean and nice decor.,Positive,,,,,
"Bathrooms with toilets so close to the floor require grab bars for safety. I have traveled the world and have never had such a ""squatty-potty"" in any branded hotel...ever!",Positive,,,,,
I have been trying for two days to get my second portfolio and no one answers the phone. For some reason you had me double booked and I need the last day of my stay which was 8/24 for $190.96.  It was apparent when I was checking out at 3:30am that the gentleman there wasn't that interested in helping me.  I went into get a snack for the airport and he was perturbed that I was paying cash and not my card.  I had gone down to the desk several times and had to wait until someone finally came out to help me.  Not great customer service.,Positive,,,,,
Nice stay,Positive,,,,,
"overall really enjoyed hotel - however room was very musty and bad for my  allergies - (so strong, my clothes were musty smelling when i got home) was on 2nd floor above pool so not sure if this was the issues",Positive,,,,,
Toilet too low. Carpet needs to be upgraded. Need grab bars in bathroom for older clients.,Positive,,,,,
Need more organization to parking.  No room so I had to park in the walk area after checking in and getting a parking ticket,Negative,,,,,

The toilets in the rooms are way too low to the floor.,Neutral,,,,,

Hyatt Regency comes with high expectations and they met them with flying colors. Kudos and thanks to the entire staff who made my stay very enjoyable!,Positive,,,,,
Sales team excellent attended conference and Adriana and dining staff during event meals were wonderful.,Positive,,,,,
"The reason for my stay is my husband is in the St. Vincent Hospital.  Currently,  I am not sure how long he will be there.   When checking in I asked if needed could I extend my stay and he responded he is unable to help me with this that I would need to go through the reservation process.   On making my reservation through World Hyatt,  they explained I would need to go through the hotel reservations to exrend.
Additionally,  I was surprised there was a $10.00 daily fee for parking.",Neutral,,,,,
Bath rooms small and no fan,Positive,,,,,
"Was able to check in early. I drove up in a heavy rain storm. My room was ready, clean and comfortable. The staff was awesome",Positive,,,,,
"Everything was fine except the breakfast which was very disappointing.  It was included with my conference rate as when I stayed a few years ago but it was extremely limited compared to last time.  Among the missing items was the omelette station, milk and cereal, an extensive bread and pastry selection, yogurt and fresh fruit.  There wasn't even a make your own waffle station like you find at almost every hotel like at Best Westerns, Marriotts and Hiltons.  Although the breakfast was free for me, it certainly wasn't worth the what was being charged (I know the cost because I had the have the charged removed from my bill) and frankly it just looked sad.  You can do better!",Positive,,,,,
Displeased with parking lot,Negative,,,,,
Housekeeping and lobby staff were very accomodating and helpful.  The hotel elevators were a little slow and we could not connect to the Wi-Fi even after following instructions from the front desk.,Positive,,,,,

I loved trying the infused water you had available!,Positive,,,,,
I have been charged for breakfast 2/3 rd time during my past stays and again had to spend some time in trying to get those charges removed.,Positive,,,,,
"I was disappointed in the breakfast that was offered. Iâ€™ve been staying at this hotel for the past few years for an annual conference I attend and in the past, each time I enjoyed the breakfast buffet that was offered. I was underwhelmed at best this year. On a positive note, the staff were courteous, kind and were helpful as expected.",Positive,,,,,
The wait for the elevators are horrible. They operate extremely slow.,Negative,,,,,
My group and I as our event planner manager have now been at the Hyatt Regency in Green Bay with a full summer conference for the past 12 years and have already booked for 3 more years into 2026.  I think that speaks of high high we regard all of the staff and the facility in Green Bay and is our strongest compliment and appreciation that I can share!,Positive,,,,,
Paying for parking unsatisfactory,Positive,,,,,
There are little touches that show the age of the hotel. The rooms are nice but the doors within the rooms are the original doors for example,Positive,,,,,
The hotel lobby was beautiful and the gym was very nice too. Our room also had a very nice large tv.,Negative,,,,,
"The bartender knew more about the area attractions than the front desk staff, he had only been in country for 4 months. The bartender was awesome. The front desk got an attitude because I was curious about area attractions and told they didnâ€™t know anything.  I will not be staying at your chain of hotels again because of this. I feel like the old class air and switch. Gavin said we were getting a river view and the gal who checked me in didnâ€™t care because there were 2 other parties trying to check in.",Positive,,,,,
The breakfast was terrible!  Elevators were always super slow.  Toilets in the rooms are made for toddlers.,Positive,,,,,
Hotel is old and beginning to really show it.,Neutral,,,,,
Free Parking was full,Positive,,,,,
"Had a wonderful experience.  However, as a female traveling alone, I was disappointed with the parking situation.  On the second evening, had to park in the parking garage.  Also, found the hotel to be very loud with the openess.  It did quiet down at night and sleeping was not an issue.  Breakfast at the pub was EXCELLENT!",Positive,,,,,
"Stairwells were dark, dingy, and uninviting.",Negative,,,,,
Anastasia is wonderful! Very efficient and helpful. Hotel has gotten really run down. I won't be returning.,Positive,,,,,
Did not that we had to pay for parking,Positive,,,,,
"Our room wasnâ€™t ready when we checked in which wasnâ€™t a problem but the checkin person wasnâ€™t enjoying her job that day. When we came back at 4:30 the room still wasnâ€™t ready and we waited till 5:15. I thought checkin time was 4, but obviously not. 

The room was very dated and the sofa in the room appeared less than clean. 

Our go to hotel is Hyatt and we have stayed in many and this Hyatt just wasnâ€™t up to speed.",Positive,,,,,
Wish there was more parking or get valet parking. HUGE inconvenience to park so far away. I stay here when I fly out of GRB as I prefer Hyatt properties but when I have to park so far I get tempted to stay closer to the airport.,Positive,,,,,
"Breakfast is pretty bad. Now itâ€™s free so ok.  But again, all is Embassy Suites quality, not what Iâ€™m used to in a HR",Positive,,,,,
"Two concerns from my recent stay.  1) I had issues connecting to the internet from my room, which was on the street side of the building.  I made a complaint to staff, once I was told the problem was fixed (it wasn't), and I was also told that staff was aware that, on the side of the building I was staying on, there were ongoing internet connectivity issues.  2) your attached Associated Bank property had some kind of renovation happening during the time I was there.  I parked my car (2011 Ford Mustang California Special collector) in the back of the parking lot nearest the entry gate.  I parked the car upon arrival on Sunday evening.  When I went out to my car on Tuesday afternoon, it was completely covered in white chalky dust.  Needless to say I wasn't happy about this and complained to the front desk staff.  I was not the only car in the lot that was effected by this.  Not sure if this was in Hyatt's control or not, but it effected many hotel guests' vehicles'.",Negative,,,,,
I stayed in room 324 and may have left my sunglasses in the kitchen area of the room. My wife left a message yesterday but has not received a phone call back. It would be nice to get a return call. Thank you.,Positive,,,,,
"The room was relatively clean but the bathroom sink wasn't completely clean and the room smelled musty.  The room was also not a good room (235) it must have been by the elevator mechanical room - I had to listen to the elevators going up and down all day and night. I also had asked about a handicap room when making reservations and was told it would cost more than the conference rate which I am not sure is allowed by ADA standards. I had a knee replacement a few weeks ago and could have used a handicap room - however, when checking in they did offer to send another bath mat to the room to help.",Positive,,,,,
I will always try to book there first.,Neutral,,,,,
As expected means your staff are exceptional...keep up the good work,Positive,,,,,
Toilet seats are very low. Also no grab bar in shower. Door in between the living area and bedroom was weird.,Negative,,,,,
The bathroom could have been cleaned a little better. There was a white splatter on the back of the bathroom door and pieces of hair in the bathtub.,Positive,,,,,
Frequently stay here and will definitely return,Neutral,,,,,
Chromecast did not work for our stay.,Positive,,,,,
I could tell the staff was stretched after a busy weekend.  They were all very professional and took care of what I needed.,Positive,,,,,
"Overall, the stay was very pleasant and comfortable. The room was well maintained, clean, and spacious for us. Everyone on the staff was very helpful and made us feel at home. I hope the conference group we were with continues to stay at the Hyatt Regency in Green Bay.",Positive,,,,,
"I was in room 505 and security said there was Wi-Fi on their report.  I can't tell you how
agravating it was.",Negative,,,,,
"The hotel is in serious need of a face-lift. The carpet is dingy and the rooms are too dark. The toilet was unusually low to the ground.  Not what I expected from a Hyatt.  The room was large, the bed was comfortable and the room was mostly quiet so those are positives. The hotel pub had terribly slow service. It took us over an hour and a half to have lunch, during which they forgot one whole meal for our party and took 20 minutes to pay the bill. We missed a solid 35 minutes of our conference session because our food came out so late and we couldn't pay our bills even though we told them in advance we were on a schedule. The breakfast in the market was wildly overpriced. A skimpy breakfast sandwich costs $9.50. Coffee and a sandwich cost me $17, which is absurd. The staff overall were friendly and nice. The overall disappointment lies with the condition of the hotel, prices, and slow pub service.",Negative,,,,,
ROOMS COULD BE CLEANER?,Positive,,,,,
It was a great experience,Positive,,,,,
Internet was terrible.,Negative,,,,,
"Food quality was lacking. With the Saturday morning breakfast in particular, the eggs were dry and the sausage was cold.",Negative,,,,,
Front desk staff was not aware of the details for meals and did not recognize that I am a rewards member and a returning guest.,Positive,,,,,
"The toilet in 512 was very low, like a kidâ€™s toilet, and not great for older adults.",Positive,,,,,
When I checked in it was a long wait with other staff just talking and when someone walked up to them they helped him.,Positive,,,,,
The hotel needs updating but the room rates were very liw and the staff was helpful and friendly. The food was okay too and staff was pleasant,Positive,,,,,
"The elevators are very slow; if that's the worst thing of which I can complain, y'all're doing  a great job. Thank you!",Negative,,,,,
"Staff was friendly, professional and helpful at the front desk at check in and at check out. 
Waitress was friendly, professional and helpful at 313 restaurant and the food was good. Hotel was clean and nice. Our room 713 was clean and nice.  Couch in the room could be updated/refreshed though. Also miss not getting travel size shampoo, conditioner, lotion, shower cap and face wipes at any of the Hyatts.  Understand that the ""new"" way is more cost effective, but it takes away from the hotel ""experience.""  Wouldn't mind paying a little more for the room to get this luxury back.",Positive,,,,,
"Breakfast Buffet was not good. 
  There just wasn't enough to choose from.   No fruit platter, no cereals, hot or cold, it was just bad.
   The pizza was dry and not very tasty,    and the coffee shop area was expensive and prices were different each time.  Carmel frappee with coffee was $5.50 from 1 person and $9.80 from someone else.  It must be a Vegan based Co. Running it.  Had to ask for coffee to be added to my frappee.  What happened to Starbucks????",Positive,,,,,
"I was very disappointed in my stay. The hotel is very nice looking and clean, but the service was underwhelming. I have repeatedly asked for answers on billing and charges and not gotten answers. I will not plan at staying at this hotel or any Hyatts in the future.",Positive,,,,,
This was our second time staying at this location. Our family of 5 has a very difficult time finding hotels where we can stay in one room. We love your 2 bed Queen suites with sleeper sofa. It is exactly what we need when we come into town to visit family.,Positive,,,,,
The kids like staying there because of the nice pool and hot tub area.  Would be nice if a stay included at least a continental breakfast.  We will likely try a different place next year after having some disappointments the last 2 years.,Positive,,,,,
The facility is nice but needs outdoor seating options.,Positive,,,,,
"The elevator was really slow. But otherwise, every staff that I encountered were very friendly. Thank you!",Positive,,,,,
Very nice hotel for a family reunion.  Nice pool and fitness center.,Positive,,,,,
"It is an incredibly loud hotel. The staff were yelling to each other across the atrium. In addition the coffee shop was very rarely staffed during our stay. We ended up having to drive to a coffee shop several times because there was no one available, even when we were able to wait 10-15 mins.",Positive,,,,,
"We stay at the Hyatt for every visit to Green Bay.  One thing I am disappointed about is that I am visiting again August 17th, however, I have to stay at a competitor next door as your prices are very high compared to them for the 3 nights. I understand the Packers are playing an exhibition game but your price per night is double than your competitor.",Negative,,,,,
An airport shuttle would be a nice addition to amenities.,Positive,,,,,
The ice bucket looked like someone threw up in it. Dryer took $8 times dry one small load of laundry. No complimentary breakfast and the restaurant charged me $12 for 4 shrimp on my salad.,Positive,,,,,
This hotel is aging and so it is time to update & refresh. While our room was clean the wood areas were nicked or scratched. Colors a bit drab. Lobby area however was quite nice. Staff very friendly & helpful.,Positive,,,,,
"We really enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.  We appreciated being able to gather in the extended lobby area for a couple family gatherings/pizza night.  What a great space!  The kids had room to move around, and we were all able to enjoy time in a very comfortable area.  We also liked the fact that all rooms were suites.  They were clean and very nicely appointed, and we had everything we needed for a great weekend.  The pool and hot tub were also very appreciated and enjoyed!  Thank you for all your hospitality.  I will recommend this hotel to anyone planning to visit Green Bay!",Positive,,,,,
"I will hopefully never stay at another Hyatt.  I will always choose Marriott moving forward.  Experience was terrible in so many ways and many of them I did not write about here.  As I said, too much to write.",Positive,,,,,
"Also called to have towels brought to the room for showering and no one answered the calls to housekeeping for next morning. Not sure if short staff or what it was, but no one answered the call.",Positive,,,,,
"Very clean. Nice, large room. Liked steam room.",Positive,,,,,
"When you have large groups of unruly guests, you dissatisfy the remainder of your guests you should offer something to those who had a bad stay.",Negative,,,,,
"The front desk staff were courteous, professional, and friendly.   The infused water provided in the lobby was wonderful and much appreciated.",Positive,,,,,
Room was booked for balcony and staff should have responded with a comp since it was very unsafe and couldn't be used. Was leaning at a severe angle and creaky.,Negative,,,,,
Not a fan of having to pay to park at the hotel. $10.00 a night? Seriously?,Positive,,,,,
Was not please that we were going to get changed an extra $25 for checking in an hour early when the room was apparently ready.,Positive,,,,,
"Breakfast was painfully slow, it generally took 30-40 mins to make an omellete and the restaurant was empty. We resorted to ordering takeout and eating it in the parking lot as that seemed to work better.

Globalists get free breakfast right? Well, I had a charge most days for gratuity or something small, no explanation why. Didn't address with front desk as they didn't seem to care much about anything.",Positive,,,,,
"Addidtional payment for parking is ridiculous.  i understand that the city owns the lot, but incorporate that fee into the room charge.  Finding out I had an additional fee of $40 on my bill after a room charge is unsettling.  I would imagine it's your number 1 complaint.  wrap it up in the room fee.",Negative,,,,,
Very disappointed in the condition of the rooms. Super disappointed there was no breakfast. I paid $272 for less then 24hrs no breakfast and pay for parking not ideal.,Positive,,,,,
"No housekeeping on a four day stay. When we requested it, they only cleaned half the room and didnâ€™t touch the hideaway bed that had to be used for two days. Parking was pathetic. Charge for parking but end up in public parking anyway.",Negative,,,,,
"The room cost is WAY OVERPRICED!! On top of the $ to spend one single night, we also had to pay $10 to park?! We wanted to stay here because itâ€™s close to nice areas we can walk to. Iâ€™ll think about somewhere else next time. Also, theres nowhere to sit outside. It was beautiful out and we stood on the sidewalk and in the parking lot because of that. It would be nice to have a nice sitting area, maybe a little fire pit or something, outdoor lighting? Especially for the cost of this hotel, you should add a lot OR cut the cost. We were gonna stay at the Kohler Lodge and thought it was too expensiveâ€¦â€¦ cheaper than your hotel and a bajillion times nicer. Disappointed ðŸ˜”",Positive,,,,,
It was refreshing to have daily maid service,Negative,,,,,
"Fix the parking situation and don't be verbally abusive to your guests. Also, try to maintain order with hotel guests that have kids running through halls until late hours of the night.",Negative,,,,,
"The staff is very nice and friendly. My negative response is not a reflection on them. The building is just not up to par in energy efficiency and the layout of the room with the living area being so dark is just not usable space for me. I spent my time in the bedroom area with a balcony chair to watch TV as it was a bright sunny room. I was happy to checkout.
NEED TO REMODEL AND FIX THINGS BEHIND THE WALLS.",Positive,,,,,
The last night of my stay I was kept up all night as the common area outside the hotel rooms was used as an all night party area.  Hotel staff did nothing to keep the hotel quiet so patrons could sleep.,Positive,,,,,
"I have to add that the bartenders and servers in the restaurant were exceptional!
We stayed overnight on Friday, July 28th in room 217 and checked out Saturday.
If the hotel manager would like to contact us we'd be more than happy to speak with him/her. Thank you",Positive,,,,,
"Hotel room was everything we expected. Comfy beds, and spacious room to spread our things. Hotel staff was very friendly and courteous. Only complaint was the wait time on the elevator. At times would take up to 5 minutes to get into the elevator.",Positive,,,,,
Too many loud kids ruminating everywhere on balconies screaming. Enforce rules and mandate people control their kids. Donâ€™t let massive groups of kids stay without supervision.,Negative,,,,,
Extremely noisy in the lobby area up until 11:00 p.m. or later - not sure why front desk staff did not quite them down? The front desk would have seen them and heard them.,Negative,,,,,
"Please donâ€™t insult me by responding with â€œwe are sorry, blah, blah, blahâ€. I reported all of the shortcomings during my stay and nothing was done. Very disappointed for the price paid!",Negative,,,,,
Excellent coffee in room and the towels were perfect.  The toilet seat was child's size and the shower head was awful. Room design in the two room suite was great.  Loved the bar stools and wide bar area.,Positive,,,,,
This hotel is extremely out dated. The furniture has stains as does much of the flooring,Neutral,,,,,
"My stay was ok, considering all the guests Hyatt had: comic con, softball team, air show, and some other convention.
The elevators were slow, and breakfast for a few days was not to Hyatt standards. I guess you had different chefs all week. Thursday morning breakfast was the best I Had all week.",Positive,,,,,
"Breakfast was sub par compared to previous years, and if it is the same next year, we will consider dining off campus for at least one or two breakfasts.",Positive,,,,,
The rooms are in need for an update.  Not nearly enough 110V plugs to charge electronic devices.,Negative,,,,,
"Beautiful Hotel, love staying here, needs faster elevators.",Positive,,,,,
Great location and could be so much more.,Negative,,,,,
Use remotes with input buttons for tvs,Neutral,,,,,
The hotel is starting to show its wear and tear again,Neutral,,,,,
"We ALWAYS stay at the Hyatt in Green Bay when we come for KitsuneKon. The convenience, the excellent staff and service, the cleanliness - I love all you do here!",Positive,,,,,

"The checkin was great they had my room ready when asked for early checkin ,basically everything else was great except those things mentioned above , the restaurant should offer more choices no pizza available",Positive,,,,,
"The breakfast buffet should include more food and condiment options for the price.
The pub food should stay open longer during the convention to account for attendees/staff who are in/running the late night panel programs",Positive,,,,,
"Told to go to bar and we will get text when I don't drink No compensation 
Was tired and ready to distress Very disappointed Have stayed there many times and talked up how this is a great hotel
Very disappointed",Negative,,,,,
It was nice . Pool room could use some  maintenance  but overall pleased.,Positive,,,,,
"The house keeping staff and additional help at the vendors and cafe were very kind and helpful, but I was consistently underwhelmed by front desk staff.",Positive,,,,,
The check in/out staff was pleasant.,Positive,,,,,
"The Breakfast experience the Hyatt provided, at the cost of $16, was the most pitiful breakfast I have ever seen provided. From a company perspective, I would have been embarrassed to show it. 

No milk, no oatmeal, no bananas. Eggs that had the consistency of rubber and were absolutely bland. Breakfast potatoes that were shriveled up, and as far from crispy as possible. No other egg options. No yogurt, any sliced fruit, or any other traditional breakfast amenities I am used to seeing at other Recencys across the United States.",Positive,,,,,
"Check-in/out was seamless through the World of Hyatt app. While I never had to text the front desk, I appreciate the option being there and would have used to request more towels, instead of calling or walking down to the front desk, had my stay been longer than one night. These features are very likely to have an impact on my future choice of hotels when traveling.",Positive,,,,,
Will very likely be back again next year!,Negative,,,,,
It was great! Beds were very comfy and clean,Positive,,,,,
"Would appreciate for options for dietary restrictions. We are both vegan and didn't have any breakfast options. Also, our friends who are not vegan were upset with the $16 breakfast when it only has sausage, eggs, and potatoes.",Positive,,,,,
How does one get points for staying at Hyatt? Am assuming we don't get points unless we used Hyatt apps only?,Neutral,,,,,

"Leslie R was outstanding to work with.   Extremely professional, courteous, and helpful.",Positive,,,,,
The rooms need to be updated.,Neutral,,,,,
I was very disappointed. According to rep there were explanations points all over and she supposedly called herself to insure we were treated well. Room overlooking air conditioning and staff yawning in your face is disappointing. I will hesitate to return,Negative,,,,,
Desk Associate that can make decision and assist guest.,Positive,,,,,
"The housekeepers need more time for details, property really showing its age",Positive,,,,,
No connection to internet!,Positive,,,,,
Free breakfast.  Everything was very pricey in the market.,Positive,,,,,
Loved staying at this hotel when I'm in town.,Positive,,,,,
"The room next to us was very loud- played music til 4am, very loud talking. We got 4 hours of sleep. I believe they were quincinera guests possibly. Reinforcing the policy of quiet times to guests might be helpful.",Positive,,,,,
Grab bars needed in shower and on wall by  toilet.,Negative,,,,,
Housekeeping was responsive to the dirty socks and the bar/restaurant staff are amazing!,Negative,,,,,
The parking was a struggle to get the gate to open.  Pool was out of towels.,Positive,,,,,

Miguel at the front desk provided amazing customer service during check-in and check-out. I really appreciate him going above and beyond.,Positive,,,,,
Bathroom could use some towel racks.,Positive,,,,,

You need to put bottled water in the rooms.,Negative,,,,,
"Fradulant charge for parking was unacceptable.
Breakfast choices were terrible or nonexistant.",Negative,,,,,
Beautiful and clean. Wonderful service. We will be back.,Positive,,,,,
Only thing I didn't like was the loudness if thr pillows and sheets. Other than that it was great!,Positive,,,,,
"If you are going to charge for a cup of coffee and its $5.00, it should be real good and the cup hold up as well as a McDonalds cup of coffee.",Positive,,,,,
My only complaint which is not real huge but the room was dusty. The light next to the bed had a lot of collected dust on it.,Negative,,,,,
"It was extremely busy. Itâ€™s felt like an airport terminal but overall I canâ€™t really complain about the facility. Staff was very busy tending to other people. Overall, the room is satisfactory.",Positive,,,,,
We had a wonderful stay and staff was awesome! Thank you,Positive,,,,,
"The staff was nice enough. The shared spaces, such as the lobby, were also nice enough. However, I typically love staying at Hyatts because of not only the nice staff,  but also the clean and well kept spaces; in this case, everything above the main floor was dingy, dusty, dark, outdated, and often covered in spiderwebs/stains.",Positive,,,,,
The problem is the extremely low toilet height in the rooms.  Staff had a riser sent to the room which was very accommodating but it should not be needed.,Negative,,,,,
"Updated signage of some sort for pool hours would have been appreciated. We made a trip to the pool room expecting to have adequate time to relax, only to be asked to leave due to closing time 10-15 minutes later; an hour earlier than the advertised time on the sign. Otherwise we were very satisfied with our stay.",Positive,,,,,
We had a nice stay we just thought the carpet and finishing were a bit tired. The items that the room was missing were promptly brought up when resquested.,Positive,,,,,
Overnight front desk staff amd bartender were great,Positive,,,,,
"Screens on the sliding doors would have been nice to open and get a breeze.  
The TV's were too small for the distance that the seating was set in the room.",Positive,,,,,
I assume its commonplace now to charge us for parking but being this is the first time I've had to pay to park at a hotel I thought that stunk.,Positive,,,,,
Loved that you welcome pet. They are part of the family. Even though we did not bring ours along. I felt good seeing other people's pets.,Positive,,,,,
The rooms were surprisingly larger than I was expecting. The rooms are clean and the presence of them mini fridge is a plus. I love that the pool is open until midnight as did my children.,Positive,,,,,
Was worth the money - would have preffered free parking but is what it is.,Positive,,,,,
We waited over 35 minutes for our breakfast. They didn't even say sorry for the wait. Very very disappointed ðŸ˜”,Positive,,,,,
"Satisfied of the look, staff and the rooms.
Old building but cleaned well and staffs were great.  Rooms can definitely use mesh screens for balconies and there are itsy bitsy bits of dust collected on places, damaged door parts (minor).",Positive,,,,,
"Everything was excellent, except there seems to be a problem with the wall to wall carpeting",Positive,,,,,
Pool chemicals way off. Strong chlorine odor. Could not even stay in pool area,Positive,,,,,
"We love your hotel, and stay for a week every year, sometimes twice a year. Two areas that we think could be improvedâ€¦ when breakfast was served in the lobby, it was so much classier. Serving a gourmet breakfast in a sports bar takes the experience down a level, and felt the prices were too high for this experience. However, the food was delicious every time we ate there. The other item is consistency with the housekeeping staff. We did not experience high quality room cleanings each day. One day, in particular, the room was hardly touched.",Positive,,,,,
Covid is over.  It is time to reinstate the breakfast buffet on a regular basis.  It is one of the reasons I choose to stay at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.,Positive,,,,,
We really enjoyed our stay.,Positive,,,,,
"At one point my wife got locked out of the room and the staff tried to help but weren't particularly helpful in the end, but we figured it out.",Positive,,,,,
"Bathroom needed hand soap. There was a large bottle of lotion attached to the wall, but no hand soap by the bathroom sink. I called and requested some and received some. Also no laundry bag, tissues had empt box. All taken care of upon request .",Positive,,,,,
There needs to be a clock in the pool area also a clock in the suites,Positive,,,,,
Housekeeping and amenities were very nice,Positive,,,,,
Great hotel and location!,Positive,,,,,
All staff very friendly.,Positive,,,,,
Handle the clientele well.,Positive,,,,,
The hotel felt dated. The new granite counters were nice but the carpet was gross and cringy. Please update to lvt. Iâ€™m,Positive,,,,,
"We have stayed at this hotel about 5 times over the last 6 years. This may be our last. Things like common area cleanliness were better than prior years. However, the hotel wifi was by far the worst this year, and almost unusable. It didn't work at all from the bedrooms and was spotty and dropped repeatedly from front rooms and common hotel areas. My reservation notes were not acknowledged at check in, and when I asked about them, the trainee staff said there were no notes and I should check back on subsequent days to get help with my request. The indoor pool area was gross, with moss in between tiles, several times no towels, and visible grime and things like bandaids and nipple covers alongside the pool deck. The unrequested wake up calls (4 mornings in a row, unplugged phone on morning 5) that the front desk could not stop, and having to ask for things like toilet paper were also misses.",Negative,,,,,
"Air conditioning that does not work well can make any stay horrible. I realize most people are ok with 73 degrees, but I cannot sleep unless it is under 71 degrees.",Positive,,,,,
see above,Positive,,,,,
"Staff was nice, it took over an hour for me to get a  clean room with no upgrade or credit to my stay. Food left in fridge in 1st room, dirty underwear left in the dresser in 2nd room, 3rd room was fine, nothing special,  window opened to a brick wall",Positive,,,,,
We have stayed at this hotel many times while visiting Green bay.,Positive,,,,,
Was woken at 12:30 by staff asking if I needed a rollaway bedâ€¦which I had not requested. The manager was very apologetic and responsive to the situation the following morning.,Positive,,,,,
Manager and staff went extra mile.,Positive,,,,,
"No ventilator in the bathroom (or itâ€™s not working), it gets steamy and stuffy after each shower.",Positive,,,,,
"Would love to have seen a self serve coffee station set up in the lobby with good coffee and a few flavored creamers, similar to Stoney Creek. And plain ice water with fresh lemon on the side.",Positive,,,,,
I have stayed before always a great experience.  Miguel is fantastic!,Positive,,,,,
"The toilet was very small and low to the floor.  I felt I was at an Elementary School Restroom not a 5 star hotel.  You can do better!  Would be nice if you provided recliners in rooms when requested.  Thank you,  Paul",Positive,,,,,
Booked a room with a balcony but found it did not have any chairs? Only one that didn't which was odd?,Positive,,,,,
Other than the hot room I feel I would definitely rent with y'all again.,Positive,,,,,
The facility was nice & clean and met our needs. Need to upgrade the toilet paper.,Positive,,,,,
"Our smoke detector was loose and fell down during our stay, otherwise things in the room and whole hotel were amazing!!!! We love it!",Positive,,,,,
It the best hotel I been to in the recent years with so much kindness and respect for guests!,Positive,,,,,
"A place to hang a hand towel near the sink would have been helpful. The room lighting was not very bright. 
I really appreciated the flavored water that was available in the lobby. Overall would stay there again",Positive,,,,,
The wifi was kind of wonky in the room-- it was strong everywhere except in the bed part of the room?  It was not available there which I thought was weird.,Positive,,,,,
This is the worst hotel experience Iâ€™ve ever had and Iâ€™m 47 years old. I spent my birthday at this hotel as a getaway staff was very rude. Hotel was very uncapped I regret staying at this hotel. I shouldâ€™ve been compensated for the terrible experience I received,Negative,,,,,
The sliding door seemed old and did not provide a sound barrier from the noisy street below. Perhaps window upgrades would improve the likelihood that I would choose to stay there again.,Positive,,,,,
Everything was good to go! My wife loved the powerful hairdryer and I liked the sitting area in our room.,Positive,,,,,
I needed to check in before 4pm and charging an extra $25 is absurd. I had heart surgery early the next day and need to be resting. My daughter had flown up from Dallas and had been up since 3 am. Obviously she needed to rest as well. I will not stay again because of your extra charge even though the room was available.,Positive,,,,,
Would liked to have a breakfast included or money off to purchase food at the 333 Pub.,Positive,,,,,
Was told parking fee would be waved ($10/night for three nights) and it was not.  Woman at desk checking out was rather rude in responding to that.,Negative,,,,,
Everything accept the sleeper sofa was pretty good. But the sleeper sofa mattress was really dirty and in broken.  I would have rated the hotel higher but I had a terrible night sleep.,Negative,,,,,
Bathrooms could be updated in rooms.,Positive,,,,,
The new carpet in room 533 is not installed well. I tripped often on the creases. Some mold found in the bathroom,Positive,,,,,
"Very very nice hotel, our first stay here, and it wonâ€™t be our last . Thank you",Positive,,,,,
Need continental breakfast and $9 for a breakfast sandwich is absurd,Negative,,,,,
"Carpet is dirty, worn and wrinkled. Not at all what I would expect at a Hyatt. In our room (715) it was a tripping issue. The entire lobby area lacks any color?",Negative,,,,,
Having stayed at Hyatt Regency Green Bay before we were disappointed to find that the complimentary breakfast is no longer offered. Not even a coffee urn in lobby.,Positive,,,,,
The rooms were nicer and cleaner than shown on the website. TVs were easily accessible. Only thing I wish was available was a list of channels available,Positive,,,,,
"Best rate for me, fabulous hotel, amazing staff, great location.",Positive,,,,,
Rooms were a little outdated,Negative,,,,,
"Outdated hotel, unfriendly staff at times (attitude about housekeeping not coming to room one day because we have a dog with us - â€œyou should know because you have a pet that they wonâ€™t come inâ€)",Negative,,,,,
Vending machines would be helpful rather than to go to the front desk otherwise always a great stay!,Positive,,,,,
Old and worn. One and done for me,Negative,,,,,
"Everything was great. Hotel is dated, which is difficult to improve without spending additional money. But the service and food were great. We used the indoor pool for 3 hours. Again, was dated but difficult to improve without forking over a pretty penny. Overall, was satisfied.",Positive,,,,,
"I do not recall, nor do my colleagues I traveled with, a fee for the parking overnight.",Negative,,,,,
very impressed with everything. maybe have breakfast start before 7am on weekends,Positive,,,,,
A little more attention to detail on cleanliness,Positive,,,,,
The only thing I did not like was the extra blanket in the room provided for the pull out couch was more on the worn side. A few stains and a faint smell of being used for a very long time.,Positive,,,,,
The going in and out of the parking lot was confusing.  I thought in the beginning that I need to have the ticket that I got when entering validated every time until I was told different.  Maybe make that a little more clear.,Positive,,,,,
Wasn't aware of the extra 100 they take out or the parking situation.  Caused problems our first night of our stay.,Negative,,,,,
"Hotel is good, is in need of a bit of an update, at least the rooms",Positive,,,,,
Thank you staff was very helpful and responsive to requests,Positive,,,,,
"Loved the bath and body products, thank you so much for that!",Positive,,,,,
Facility is getting dated,Neutral,,,,,
"The hotel was good, everything as expected. Rooms are spacious and hotel staff was great. The restaurant was the worst food Iâ€™ve ever ate. I am not picky AT ALL and I could not finish my meal. Our entire team ordered take out at the restaurant and the next morning every single family mentioned how terrible their food was. Very disappointing, spent $92 to feed my family of 4 and none of finished our food. Really really bad.",Negative,,,,,
I liked the flavored water near the front desk.,Negative,,,,,
Reservations were easily completed by phone.,Neutral,,,,,
"The room was clean on the surface, but could have used some more attention to cleaning behind & under things.",Positive,,,,,
Every staff member I encountered was pleasant and helpful. The quality of the food served in the complex could be improved.,Positive,,,,,
Very good conference coffee.  Refreshing water available.,Positive,,,,,
The meals were perfect!,Positive,,,,,
Toilets were amazingly low in height.  Elevators are slow.  We didn't anticipate daily housekeeping (without requesting it).  That was impressive.,Positive,,,,,
"public areas of hotel needed dusting and glass surfaces not clean, breakfast service slow, was served tepid coffee with grounds in it out of carafe.  My room was immaculately clean and neat. please switch to comfort height toilets.",Positive,,,,,
There were issues with the wifi. I could receive emails but not send them. I had to go elsewhere to find wifi that enabled me to send emails. Very inconvenient. Everything else was very good.,Positive,,,,,
The bathroom was very small for the size room we had - 2 Queen plus sofa bed with kitchen area.,Neutral,,,,,
Room was a tad dated but otherwise just fine. Nice staff,Positive,,,,,
"Front desk staff was excellent. Hotel is showing its age a little,(carpeting in the room needs stretching or replacing to get rid of raised areas), but loved being attached to the conference center for our meetings and the bed was very comfortable. Limited restaurant choices (Pub only, with limited menu options and no variety from day to day) within the hotel or within easy walking distance.  Limited options when you are there for several days (we didn't opt for any of the meals that could be purchased within the conference).",Positive,,,,,
My reservation was listed as a wedding attendee and not as a UMC conference attendee. I returned the gift bag which had a wedding note in it. It caused an extra trip to front desk which was not a problem.,Positive,,,,,
The HVAC in the conference center was ridiculous and made for an extremely uncomfortable experience. In the 80â€™s then dropping into the 60â€™sâ€”both extremes were almost impossible to tolerate and both on the same afternoon meant that we couldnâ€™t wear clothing to be able to adjust.,Negative,,,,,
"My only recommendation is to change the coffee in the coffee shop.  I wasnâ€™t impressed with the Torke.  Granted, I only drank it once but it was weak and lacked flavor.",Positive,,,,,
Better elevator service would be good. Very slow.,Positive,,,,,
"It was extremely disappointing to see there was no continental breakfast, and the options that were available were unhealthy sandwiches or overpriced cups of fruit.",Negative,,,,,
Like the service overal,Positive,,,,,
All was very nice.  I have high expectations for the Hyatt and they were all met!,Positive,,,,,
"Facility layout is dated, but perfect for our group.  Lots of people and lots of kids!!",Positive,,,,,
"The room touch up each day was spot on.  I didn't expect more than garbage emptying and I felt that the daily room refresh was beyond my expectations.  But as I mentioned before, the hard surfaces could have been cleaner.",Positive,,,,,
Conference room temperature bad.  First very warm then freezing cold.,Negative,,,,,
It would be nice to have towel racks in the bathroom.,Positive,,,,,
"I was not informed ahead of time of extra fees associated with my stay.  The hold my card set me over my limit and the charge for parking was not explained ahead of time in any form.  I appreciate however, the staff addressing my concerns and adjusting the fees as they were able.  I was still charged $20 more for the entire stay than my initial reservation showed.",Positive,,,,,
"We had unsolicited wake-up calls at 5:55 am several days, even after I called and asked for them to be stopped.....twice!  That was extremely annoying.",Negative,,,,,
The food was over priced and not kid friendly,Positive,,,,,
We were in room 301. Drain in tub was very slow.,Negative,,,,,
The bed was comfortable.,Positive,,,,,
"Strange, but the toilet was really LOW. It was lower than toilets in my house and in most public locations. Functional, just a longer drop than expected!",Negative,,,,,
I when rooms are available when I arrive before 4:00 I feel you are not welcoming when I need a room before that time unless I pay an additional $25.,Positive,,,,,
This propriety needs a face lift. I also prefer to not have the room facing the interior of the hotel atrium. I will not recommend this property to others.,Negative,,,,,
"The room, pool, lobby, elevatorâ€¦ everything was so clean and nice! This has become my new favorite hotel and wherever I am Iâ€™ll be using Hyatt-Regency hotels in the future!!",Positive,,,,,
"Pricey compared to other options, but the convenience and the fact that someone else was paying for it got me there",Positive,,,,,
My stay with the Hyatt Green Bay was wonderful!!!! Although the outside of the building needs a facelift and I would like like the toilet seats to be higher so I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m on the floor using the toilet and has to figure out how to get up.  Those toilet seats are for little kids.  Overall my stay was great!!!,Positive,,,,,
"temperature control in the conference room was non-existent
acoustics in the conference room was poor
could not get out of the parking lot w/o staff assistance",Negative,,,,,
"Beautiful hotel, great staff, comfortable rooms. The only downside was the volume of the other guests. Itâ€™s the loudest hotel Iâ€™ve ever visited. If youâ€™re coming for rest, good luck. Itâ€™s perfect otherwise.",Positive,,,,,
Perfect location for us and the staff is always welcoming and helpful.,Positive,,,,,
The room noise from outside was unacceptable and woke my wife and I up during the night. Some parts of the hotel felt outdated and should be updated.,Negative,,,,,
You could have offered breakfast,Positive,,,,,
"For the price, in room amenities were lacking.  As mentioned above.  Also Kleenex ran out after a few sheets.  Why isnâ€™t there an extra towel on the bar area?",Negative,,,,,
The position of the card reader at the entrance/ exit to the parking lot made it necessary to open the door and partially exit my car every time I entered or exited the hotel,Neutral,,,,,
No shower gel in the shower nor tissue box in the room. Mentioned it at the check out and they said they would address.....would have been helpful to hear I am so sorry this happened; how can I make it right for you?,Positive,,,,,
The hotel was very nice and the room was even better than expected.,Positive,,,,,
"The staff was excellent and personable. The room was very nice and clean. The mattress and pillows were very uncomfortable. Lumpy mattress and flat pillows. Otherwise, we enjoyed the stay at this location.",Positive,,,,,
Breakfast prices are insanely high,Negative,,,,,
Excellent stay!!  Love the Hyatt Regency Green Bay will def be back!!,Positive,,,,,
Your entry and exit from the parking lot is poorly designed.  In order to hit the pad to open the gate the passenger had to get out of the car and touch the pad.,Negative,,,,,
"We were missing enough towels but that was corrected.

The toilet didnâ€™t flush well.",Negative,,,,,
You should have a free breakfast,Positive,,,,,
Was told at check - in that there would be a $10 per day parking fee. Unacceptable,Negative,,,,,
Soundproof your rooms. Traffic noise is not acceptable. No lounge for premium members?,Negative,,,,,
"There weren't fitted sheets on the bed, just a regular sheet tucked in which slides off.",Positive,,,,,
Breakfasts were exceptional! Staff was very nice.,Positive,,,,,
The front staff upon checking in was very helpful and went out of their way to find me establishments that were within walking distance of hotel. They provided names and addresses for me.,Positive,,,,,
"I've stayed at this hotel multiple times.  The lady at the front desk was very focused on ensuring I understood that they were 'making an exception' for me ( my reservation showed as a ADA room ).  Later that evening when I asked the other front desk member to validate my parking, I overheard the same lady say 'did you check to make sure he paid for parking'.  While I realize that is probably the proper procedure... it didn't feel very welcoming ( granted she didn't intend for me to hear her ).  Like I said... I've stayed at this property several times over the past 8 years, due to the proximity to my office.  I'm seriously considering switching to a different hotel for future stays ( I've switched once before but came back out of convenience ).",Positive,,,,,
Still some problems with room cards not working properly,Positive,,,,,
Very loud next to the road which Iâ€™m sure there is nothing you can do about that,Negative,,,,,
"Room was super hot and wouldnâ€™t get cold, no matter lowering of the AC. 

At 8 and 805, our phone rang to tell us the weather. We did not want this at all and it woke us up in a frustrating way.",Negative,,,,,
"I was pleased with my stay overall. Welcomed as a globalist, but no special treatment other than water and breakfast. Great facility, lots of kids.",Positive,,,,,
Last minute weekend getaway and this hotel was perfect! Great location and staff. We will definitely stay here again!,Positive,,,,,
Refresher course for your front desk staff on hospitality.,Positive,,,,,
Pool was out of commission for 2 days of my stay. It is one of the main reasons I stay here so that was disappointing ðŸ˜ž,Negative,,,,,
See above,Positive,,,,,
We were charged 40.00 more than they quoted us.,Neutral,,,,,
"My check in and overall experience was wonderful! I just have a few items to bring to your attention. At checkin the associate stated if I joined your loyalty program I would get 50% off my parking fee of $10. He was a very pleasant and I decided to join even though I really wanted to get to my room as I was a late arrival. Again, the checkin experience was very nice but at check out I was charged $10 for parking. When I departed I did stop at the front desk but opted for an email receipt. It is $5 so I wasnâ€™t going to make a fuss but for future guests remember it is important to do what you say you will. 
The last item is in regards to housekeeping.There was a purple dental floss stick on the ground along the base of the bed closest to the closet. It was not ours. Please make note to all room inspectors to double check along the bed frames when inspecting rooms to approve for checkin. 
Again, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay! These small items will not deter me from staying again or from sharing my great experience with others. Thank you for a beautiful stay!",Positive,,,,,
"The rooms were very clean. There was something annoying about the alarm clock but I can't remember what...is it not plugged in or easy to use or something? 
If my mother-in-law were sharing a room with me, I'd be annoyed at the interior door placement: it should separate the sleeping room from the space. Not the bathroom AND the sleeping room...",Positive,,,,,
Very cool building!!,Positive,,,,,
Beds are comfortable but too high. Need a little foot stool by the bed to climb in for shorter people and or anyone with a disability,Positive,,,,,
"We have stayed in this hotel many years ago when it was an Embassy Suites.  It was a wonderful hotel so we expected it to be the same.  We were very disappointed.  The staff was not helpful, we did not expect to be charged for parking in your lot and the restaurant was way over priced.  The advertised price was much lower than what it turned out to be.  The room was wonderful as we had requested a handicap accessible room.  It was roomy and the bathroom was just what my husband needed.  We were amazed at check in though that the staff did not know if the toilet was handicap accessible.  We were told that they were not allowed to see the rooms so they didn't know.  The manager was asked and she didn't know.  That is very sad!  It was a lovely room as I said but overall the stay was not a good experience.",Positive,,,,,
The manager on staff was the greatest! I just didnâ€™t like that they had to call him for my needs. I did book through a different site and not through the Hyatt. I will never do that again. The manager at the Hyatt is the greatest ever. He was awesome.,Positive,,,,,
Starbucks was very nice!,Negative,,,,,
"Elevator squeaked every time it went up and down.  Our room was right by the elevator.  As you can imagine, not a great night for sleeping.",Positive,,,,,
"As always our stay at the Hyatt Regency in Green Bay. We love the hot tub, pool, sauna and especially steam room. We always stop at the bar and have a few cocktails and the food is excellent. Cheese balls yum! The most comfy beds, almost makes ya not miss your bed at home.",Positive,,,,,
Wish we had known about parking fee before booking.,Positive,,,,,
We were in room 302. There was a intermittent buzzing sound we believe was coming from elevator going on all night,Negative,,,,,
I purchased my hotel package through Priceline & the receipt from Hyatt which I had emailed to me shows a different credit amount.  I now must call Hyatt & see why it differs and make sure Iâ€™m not double charged.,Negative,,,,,
"My sister and I enjoyed our stay however our room did smell of chlorine the entire time. It wasnâ€™t terrible by any means, just a small warning wouldâ€™ve been appreciated.",Positive,,,,,
"Could not believe I had to use a QR code to get hotel info and apple expected me to pay 6.99 for the app.   Nuts.   Couldnâ€™t adjust thermostat, no extra blankets in room, having to pay for parking (when we had a horrific time even finding a space), breakfast not included, 1 tiny bar of soap I guess you weâ€™re supposed to carry from sinks in kitchen and bathroom, few lights so dark and hard to see even in suitcase.   I could go on and on.   The only positive experience was when we asked for a blanket the 2nd night the hotel engineer brought it up, helped with thermostat and was very friendly.  Internet continuously cut out with movie we tried to watch and my iPad.    I expect more from a Hyatt, this wasnâ€™t a Comfort Inn.",Positive,,,,,
Both while checking in and checking out the clerk struggled.,Negative,,,,,
"Extremely fast check-in & check-out, clean hotel, nice hotel room.",Positive,,,,,
The hotel room looked â€œworn.â€ Need to upgrade the toilet from a childrenâ€™s height to an adult height fixture!!! Why was there a paper towel stuck against the sizing in Room 708????,Negative,,,,,
Not enough parking spaces.,Negative,,,,,
On arrival there was no room but might be a room if we paid $25 to find out but no guarantees until I mentioned that I would be mentioning this in my feedback when suddenly there is a free up grade immediately available! No smiles no welcome.   The room was clean and had a bed and a shower.  In the bar the server does not understand her own menu and brings the wrong drinks in the wrong way - soft drink ina bottle and beer in a glass. All unsmiling and unhelpful.  We will help them out by not putting them to the trouble of serving us again.,Positive,,,,,
We have been going to this same hotel for 30 years but are disappointed.  I usually call a couple days ahead to ask if we can get our favorite or similar type of room facing Main Street and typically I get to talk to a guy named James and all I get is what his position is and totally ignores my request.  I have to be honest we are spoiled because we have always been treated like an a one guest and have loved the people that work there.  If they told you something that is exactly how it is.  The young lady that checked us in was fantasticâ€” her name was Ashleighâ€” she went above to make us happy.  Otherwise the front desk when you walked by in the morning would always say good morning or acknowledge you but that is a rare occasion now.  Becky is fantastic anytime that I talk to her.  I am sorry if this sounds like a bunch of wining but I use to be soooo excited when we were going to be there and that is not the feeling anymore.  Thank you for your time,Positive,,,,,
Will stay again!,Neutral,,,,,
Very dog friendly and was very happy with it!!,Positive,,,,,
"The hotel is old, it is nowhere near standards Hyatt has set for Regency Hotels.  It felt like a hotel that was great back in the 70's or 80s, and it was strangely similar to a Hilton Garden Inn.",Positive,,,,,
The ten dollar parking fee was unexpected and lame.,Negative,,,,,
Maintenance needs list is long,Negative,,,,,
"Elevators are slow and one was broken.  I'm sure it's not feasible to add, but more elevators would be great!",Negative,,,,,
"Fix the elevators. I got stuck in one temporarily, and then it was out of order. My empression is that those elevators need work.",Positive,,,,,
The hotel itself was great. I would still recommend despite the hiccup referenced above.,Positive,,,,,
We were very impressed with our room as well as the building for the cost.,Positive,,,,,
"rooms need an update. Dark and outdated,toilet seems about ten inches off the floor.",Negative,,,,,
Fix your windows so your guests can sleep.,Neutral,,,,,
rooms had plenty of space - just hanging bar in closet was a little high,Positive,,,,,
"My best experience ever!  Amazingly kind and helpful staff.  Ambassadors actually as I was interviewing as a finalist for a position in Green Bay.  They definitely gave me a positive feel, like I could imagine myself living there! Best staff ever!",Positive,,,,,
"Fitness center was outstanding. Everything else was moderately ok.  The overall hotel is showing its age. Rooms are out of date and barely functional. Fridge barely worked. No breakfast bar. Breakfast not available until 7 and our meetings started at 7:30, so never had the time.",Positive,,,,,
Towels plentiful and very good.,Negative,,,,,
"We loved the balconies, and enjoyed our flash mob singing the Star Spangled Banner and the Battle Hymn of the Republic from them. Beautiful. Nice large rooms. Bathrooms close to conference rooms.",Positive,,,,,
Starbucks coffee could be tastier. Both drinks that I had lacked flavor for the amount of money it costs. The Pub food is always amazing!!,Positive,,,,,
Excellent room!,Positive,,,,,
A simple included breakfast would have made all the difference,Positive,,,,,
"The mattresses were memory foam, too soft, and way too high.",Positive,,,,,
Thinner mattresses. Short people need to be told to bring step ladders to get on the bed. Grab bar for safe entry into bath/shower.,Positive,,,,,
"When checking in I was not greeted as a loyal Hyatt Customer or returning guess to the Green Bay Hyatt. I stay 10-20 Nights at this hotel a year. Just not the same the last few stays, as in the past.",Positive,,,,,
At check in they asked for my parking ticket to make sure it would work when I left.,Positive,,,,,
For Saturday morning breakfast we had a long wait.,Positive,,,,,
Breakfast should be included especially with a more expensive room,Positive,,,,,
Room was cold,Negative,,,,,
"I did leave one black toiletry soft sides bag in the compartment under the bathroom counter, in the cubby hole on the right side of the sink-- room 216, I have left a message asking the housekeeping to look for it, and am hoping they will find it",Positive,,,,,
Loved the Cinco de Mayo celebration snacks and beverages. Very helpful with my loading and unloading equipment!,Positive,,,,,
The hotel was absolutely  beautiful  and the room above what I expected.  However thevriadvtraffic was very noisy.,Neutral,,,,,
The curtains need a good vacuuming.,Positive,,,,,
I was happy with the hotel and the room.  I was not expecting the parking to be as ridiculous as it was.  I was told on the phone a few days before my stay that if I became a member of the Hyatt Regency that I would not have to pay $10.00 for parking.  So the person I talked to on the phone said they could sign me up over the phone and then I could pay $5.00 for parking.  That was not the case.  I had to park in main street parking ramp across the street and had to pay $9.35 for parking.  I have never stayed at a hotel where I had to pay for parking.  So that was disappointing.,Negative,,,,,
The only problem was the parking. I had to pay for parking across the street which wasnâ€™t expected. It would also be helpful to have a continental breakfast for free.,Positive,,,,,
I arrived extremely early and asked for a room.  Was told check in time and early check in time.  I was there at 8:15am in the morning.  I had to ask 3 times and was finally told there was an early check in fee of $25.  I said I would gladly pay.,Positive,,,,,
Your night check guy was great!,Positive,,,,,
"The system went down right when we got there and we were unable to check in. This was an definitely an inconvenience for us (and everyone else checking in at that time). The staff was very nice about it but I feel like it could have been handled a little better. Also, it would be nice for the price you pay to get complementary breakfast. Overall, the hotel looks very nice and the staff was very friendly, so I would come back.",Positive,,,,,
"Overall great experience. I am just disappointed that I had to pay for parking, especially since the parking lot is attached to the hotel.",Negative,,,,,
"Luggage carts are necessary but very difficult to maneuver. There didnâ€™t seem to be adequate staffing to  assist moving heavy, awkward carts.",Positive,,,,,
Food in buffet ran out quick and staff was slow getting food and I was yelled at by people in the line for holding it to wait on the staff to bring food.,Positive,,,,,
Disappointing to not have any housekeepingâ€”inadequate bathroom towels washcloths for guests for two nightbstay,Negative,,,,,
"The rooms were nice, I love that they are all suites. It was a bit stuffy in our room the first night, but opened the doors to get some circulation. The complimentary churros and Mexican hot chocolate was amazing on Cinco de mayo! I liked the flavored water dispensers in the lobby as well.",Positive,,,,,
It would be nice to have a good coffee in the lobby rather than only in the room and then having to buy it.,Positive,,,,,
"The room didnâ€™t have a bathmat when we arrived. Also, three washcloths instead of two would have been nice.",Positive,,,,,
"My sincere thanks to James on your management team. While my initial arrival was somewhat disappointing as I was not prepare to find a Hyatt property without valet or bell service, James did an excellent job of service recovery and completely overwhelmed me. He recognized my World of Hyatt status assisted me himself and even provided an upgraded room to make up for the fact their property did not offer the expected services. Add to that the delicious meals, wonderful service in the Pub and the immaculate condition of the property..kudos to â€œ Nancyâ€ in Housekeeping. She excelled at her job and was so friendly to our entire party..and the result was that our group was delighted with our event at the Green Bay Hyatt.",Positive,,,,,
Getting a new reservation is a hassle.,Positive,,,,,
Could hear plumbing noises from other rooms when they flushed toilets.,Neutral,,,,,
Disappointed I was charged $10 on top of my room cost to park my vehicle in the parking lot.,Negative,,,,,
Elevators are slow and pushing the down button on the floor usually meant you were going up when you got on. Not the end of the world.,Negative,,,,,
"Everyone was very nice and friendly, but I think of a Hyatt as a top tier name. The rooms are a bit tired (carpet bubles, things look old, grout missing and discolored) it seems more like a lower tier hotel except in common areas where things look newer.",Negative,,,,,
Could use more luggage carts.  Waited forever for a cart.  Ended up making two trips from our room carrying luggage to our car.,Neutral,,,,,
We loved the pool and steam room.,Negative,,,,,
This was not an experience I would expect from a Hyatt.,Positive,,,,,
Hotel always so clean.  Staff always nice.  Rooms are wonderful.  Spacious and clean.  Beds are sooo comfortable,Positive,,,,,
i was surprised that the hotel was so dark and dingy,Positive,,,,,
Motors for elevator very noisy. Only because I was extremely tired did I fall asleep.,Negative,,,,,
Missing items never returned to us. You should be buying us a new one.,Negative,,,,,
Should have facial tissue in the rooms,Neutral,,,,,
"WiFi was not working on the 7th floor.  
The elevators were extremely slow.",Neutral,,,,,
It is unfortunate that there is only one set of stairs (which are a bit uncomfortable/unsafe for use) to get to the 2nd or 3rd floor.,Negative,,,,,
"I received a wakeup call the first two mornings even though I did not ask for one.  After the first one I was assured that it wouldn't happen again, but it did.  5:30 am both mornings.",Positive,,,,,
The box lunch that we received on Saturday had a rotten apple in my box. Most everyone needed to get another sweater or jacket to keep warm. The dinner on Saturday night had much to be desired for $50.,Positive,,,,,
"Even though the breakfast service was bad, the food was good.  The front desk staff was helpful",Positive,,,,,
"I would stay again without hesitation. 
Also excellent pillows and room furnishings.",Positive,,,,,
Grateful to be told by the front desk that we were able to park in the bank parking lot across the street if the Hyatt Parking lot was full.,Positive,,,,,
The pub did not appear prepared to handle the crowd on Friday evening for dinner. Long waits for food and service as very few people were working in the Pub. Otherwise the food was very good.,Positive,,,,,
"Front desk staff  needs to be trained better with way finding questions concerning location of parking lot. How things work like the whirlpool. Compliment to Samantha and the gentleman who work the front desk they really know their hotel and gave great help and were knowledgeable on your facility.  
Restaurant staff could be better attentive to guests. A lot of confusion, poor attentive skills to customers.",Positive,,,,,
very satisfied especially with the check in personnel,Positive,,,,,
Restaurant service was terrible.  Very slow at dinner and ignored at breakfast.  Did get cup of coffee after waiting 15 minutes.  Waitress never came back to take order after walking by us several times.  Finally threw $6 on counter and walked out after waiting over 35 minutes,Positive,,,,,
Bed was way to soft,Positive,,,,,
The dinning experienced was the worse I've ever had,Positive,,,,,
"The hotel needs some basic updates and repairs. There were terrible repairs done on the drywall in the bathroom. The room seemed old and needs some refreshing. I would also prefer a separate sheet than just having one piece covering the comforter. Also, the temp controls were non-existent. The room was very warm, so I had to keep opening my sliding door, which did not make me feel very comfortable since it didn't have a screen.",Positive,,,,,
"The stairs & elevator are pretty concerning. The elevator is very slow & many of the stairwells end in random places not getting you to the lobby. Also, I canâ€™t imagine trying to evacuate in an emergency.",Negative,,,,,
"I answered ""as expected"" because I had very high expectations after my fantastic stay in February of 2022. This second visit also delivered on those expectations; I am very satisfied and plan to visit again in the future.",Positive,,,,,
I was there for a recent conference.  All the meeting rooms were ice cold.,Negative,,,,,
"I thought parking was covered when they handed me a validated ticket, but later I saw a $10 charge for parking.",Positive,,,,,
Sam and Summer and the crew in Pub333 were amazing,Positive,,,,,
"Parking is always a hassle when I stay. Every time I check-in I submit the proper paperwork for tax exempt and every time it is lost at check-out and I get charged tax. This time I brought a extra copy, so I got it corrected.",Negative,,,,,
I will be back on Monday again and hope to have a better room/experience. I ate dinner at the restaurant and it took over an hour and 15 minutes to get my meal. The server apologized and comped my meal but I still had to wait until 9:30 to eat my dinnerâ€”not helpful when I had to catch a 5 am flight.,Positive,,,,,
"Overall enjoyable- very clean.  Convenient store my husband  and I arrived around 9pm  The restaurant was not open so we got food at the Convenient shop we got 2 salads, cheese,  one Pepsi, and a sandwich for over $40. Yikes",Positive,,,,,
Very clean and helpful staff,Positive,,,,,
Beautiful hotel!,Neutral,,,,,

"Kind, staff, quick service, clean rooms.  Good job, crew!",Positive,,,,,
"Disappointing to find out there is no breakfast  complimentary. 
Grateful for the long pool hours.
Parking was difficult when arriving late. Would have appreciated stairs in addition to elevators",Positive,,,,,
"As a Sr citizen, i found the whole parking (room keys for exits etc) confusing and the TV streaming not something we could even navigate.   Thankful for an old timer TV in the living area.  And my husband and I are knowledgeable about technology but that was crazy too much for us.",Positive,,,,,
Cost needs to be better with food and beverages and coffee shop only offers three drinks which should offer what is wanted,Positive,,,,,
Those hotel elevators are so very slow. The skywalk between the parking ramp and hotel/conference center desperately needs a refresh.,Positive,,,,,
Rooms are dated and in need of updating.  water damage in bathroom from shower.  Just tired overall in the rooms and atrium could be updated with paint to make it brighter.,Negative,,,,,
"I had stayed at this hotel numerous times in the past but I have not been there for the past five years. I am amazing how well kept are the rooms and I love that the suite portion of the hotel rooms are still available. I loved my experience last week so decided t to extend my stay. I'll be happy to pay the $100 pet fee again as you guys accommodated me far from the elevators (to avoid bell noises) and I had plenty of places close to the hotel to walk my dog. It's a safe city, and the proximity to Titletown is a plus, for those of us that prefer walking to places when attending conferences.",Positive,,,,,
I chose to use the stairs at one point as I didn't want to wait for access to an elevator. I was unable to access the first floor from the fourth floor without going outside in the stairwell that I chose.,Positive,,,,,
Marketplace items were WAY TOO expensive.,Negative,,,,,
"The splash pad area in the pool was also out of order the entire time, my daughter would have loved that.",Positive,,,,,
I was rather shocked that safe's were not available to even rent. I did not feel comfortable leaving my valuables in my room during the conference. So I ended up lugging them around for 4 days.,Positive,,,,,
Need daily housekeeping,Negative,,,,,
I wish I was told if there was a continental breakfast during check in or what time the pool closes to how long will my transaction pend in my account till it actually goes thru.,Positive,,,,,
Very nice stay. Pool was nice too.,Positive,,,,,
Clean room and friendly staff,Positive,,,,,
"The Pub wait staff on the evening of April 20th was inattentive. It took us 15-20 minutes for them to take our order and they were just standing around at the bar. The restaurant was not busy. The meal came out incomplete and missing items and sauces and I received the incorrect change back when I paid for my mealâ€¦she gave me dollar bills, but didnâ€™t give the change. The 2 women who were working the morning of April 21st were extremely helpful and attentive.",Negative,,,,,
The parking cost is ridiculous and it definitely doesn't accommodate for the family demographic as there isn't really anything for children to do other than swim. Also the pub prices were not conducive for a family of 4 on a single income.,Positive,,,,,
"You need to step it up.  I feel like rooms would not pass a cleanliness inspection.  I didn't even trust myself to sit on the sofa in my room- it was in such awful shape, I would throw it out.  Bathroom was pretty gross with stray hairs that hadn't be cleaned.",Negative,,,,,
Great experience for the Autism Conference,Positive,,,,,
Very nice stay,Positive,,,,,
Pool and whirlpool were nice.,Positive,,,,,
Elevator to the top floors is so slow.,Negative,,,,,

There was a lot of road noise,Positive,,,,,
Thank you!,Positive,,,,,
"Toilet slow to flush, worried about using for #2.",Negative,,,,,
The only thing I was very unhappy with was I kept getting booted off the internet with my phone several times as well as my laptop. The girl at the desk was very helpful and could not understand why this was happening but it continued throughout my stay. I heard the same complaint out of other people I was with.,Positive,,,,,
Overall a great experience,Positive,,,,,
"Overall it was a positive experience.  Apparently I need to bring soap, an additional sweatshirt and specific food items.  The coffee was pleasantly good in the morning(love the Starbucks!).",Positive,,,,,
Free parking for Hyatt members would be nice.,Positive,,,,,
Rooms on Main Street side are noisy,Negative,,,,,
You need to clean the carpet in the atrium.  I know it is hard to keep clean.,Positive,,,,,
My status wasnâ€™t recognized and I had to ask for the bottled water and amenities,Positive,,,,,
"When I made the reservation, they got my email wrong so I did not get my reservation confirmation via email, therefore there was a confusion on complimentary breakfast.  And, by the time we asked about it- the staff replied that they had ""done away"" with complimentary breakfast even though the website advertised complimentary breakfast if we booked and stayed by 8/24/23.",Positive,,,,,
"Front desk very friendly and helpful, and willing to hold my suitcase in locked storage before my check-in and after my check-out (to accommodate my conference schedule).",Positive,,,,,
"love that you are practicing some sustainable practices such as large refill bottles of conditioner, shampoo, body wash",Positive,,,,,
Had to recheck in when reservations was for 2 days .,Positive,,,,,
"Front manager, James was a true professional when it came to exceeding my expectations on the urgency at which he addressed the issues with route 813. I commend him on taking action and moving me to another room within one hour. I also respect that they did in fact, block off the room until it has been thoroughly cleaned.",Negative,,,,,
Difficulty in making a new reservation.,Positive,,,,,
Food was terrible at the restaurant. I paid 20 for a flatbread nothing else. Mean I said fries but it was debated with waitress. Waited over 30 mins and we were firsts ones in there.,Negative,,,,,
The bathroom shoulf have a box of tissues (Kleenex).,Positive,,,,,
We were in handicapped room. It needs a higher toilet. Things in the shower are mounted too high for someone sitting.,Negative,,,,,
Rooms are looking a litlle outdated but overall nice and clean,Positive,,,,,
Very happy with stay. Have been there a number of times in the past and always a great experience. Thank you.,Positive,,,,,
Usually there is a do not disturb sign. We do not need or want housekeeping during our stays. We went to the desk to request no housekeeping for our 3 night stay. We came back to the hotel and saw housekeeping had come into our room. We were annoyed. There had been 3 employees present when we requested no housekeeping. I can understand if what we might be doing in the room was questionable. We are professionals and have come to this Hyatt multiple times.,Positive,,,,,
They brought up some fans to drown out the street racing - there is a lack of electrical outlets in the bedroom to plug a short corded fan into,Negative,,,,,
Breakfast service was too slow so i had to grab a bagel and coffee at shop; not my first choice but ok.,Positive,,,,,
I had to ask for a non-slip mat in the bathtub. It was delivered.,Neutral,,,,,
Waited 15 mins in the coffee shop to order coffee but no worker,Negative,,,,,
Soap dispensers in shower were not filled.,Positive,,,,,
"I think you could have had complimentary coffee in the morning instead of $4.00 cup to buy,otherwise was a nice stay",Positive,,,,,
"We would have liked some regular food.  Like burgers, chicago style hot dogs, fries, club sandwiches, etc.",Positive,,,,,
Mattress was very hard. My hip hurt all the next day.,Positive,,,,,
Breakfast service was horrible,Negative,,,,,
"During the night, I got up to use the restroom at 3:18 AM, at 3:23 AM a loud noise went off that sounded like a gun shot.  This is an old Embassy Suites, so all the rooms surround an open are concept.  I stayed up a bit to make sure nothing was wrong.  

I have a shooting range in my front yard and know the sound of gun shoots.  The only other noise could have been a large flat surface somehow dropping.

I also am part owner of a Hampton and a Fairfield.  I stayed here because of the group I was with.",Negative,,,,,
Drunk men in pool area not ok with tween daughter. Barking dog at 4 and  5 am. Slamming door by drunk guy at 320 am woke me up. Old guys laughing at 6 am in dining area woke me up for good.,Positive,,,,,
"It would be nice to have shuttle service from the hotel to the airport but besides that, the hotel is great. The rooms are excellent and the pool and gym are excellent.",Positive,,,,,
No one told me there's be a separate $10/day parking fee.  I expected a free breakfast.  The $20 breakfast I did get was inedible.  I asked for my fried eggs not to be crispy and they were solid brown on top and bottom.  It's like the cook went out of his way to do the opposite of my request.  That's on top of waiting a half hour and there were only 3 other tables with people.  The manager did comp my meal so that was good customer service.,Positive,,,,,
"Said my room was not ready at 4:00 when I went to check in and they would let me know when it was via text. I waited two hours, went to grab a bite to eat and in two hours was never informed the room was ready.  They said it was an error that some people never got the text. Also, I was charged $20 instead of $10 for parking because no one at the desk ever bothered to ask or mention that if I'm in the hotel lot they can validate the ticket and I'm charged $10.  How would I know that I was supposed to mention that? Yet the blame was pushed on me because I didn't mention it. I ordered one item in the hotel restaurant, a small salad. Asked for chicken on it. Never was added, halfway through meal waitress mentioned they forgot and did I want it. Why would I want the chicken when I already ate half the salad. Terrible service. If it was just one mistake I'd be more understanding. But it was just so many.",Negative,,,,,
The hotel is run down and in terrible shape,Negative,,,,,
"We had reserved a block of rooms for our large group staying at the hotel. We did this to be near each other in the hotel. This request to have our group have rooms together was conveyed. However, upon check in we found out that no one in our group was near each other. I had also requested to have an adjoining room with another family and that request was not met. The person who initially checked us in said there wasnâ€™t anything she could do. However, another person working the check in offered to put our rooms together which was helpful. In the end everything worked out, but it was one more hassle that needed to be dealt with after a longer drive to arrive.",Positive,,,,,
Was told refund on parking still charged. Charged for room keys,Positive,,,,,
Food in the pubâ€¦. Could have been better for the orice,Positive,,,,,
"Bathrooms need a major update-sooo tiny compared to the spaciousness of the room. The toilets are so low to the ground!  If staying there for anything to do with the convention center-ridiculous amount of walking to the ONE elevator under the stairwell. There needs to be multiple elevators in more areas of the hotel to make me want to come back for another convention there involving staying at the Hyatt. Being handicapped, the distance to the elevator was challenging. The mattresses are DIVINE!!",Positive,,,,,
"We had breakfast included in room price for a family of 4. We ordered two meals for the adults and one adult meal for the children to split in half. We were still charged for the children's meal even though it was probably cheaper cost-wise to have them split an adult meal in half vs ordering each their own children's meals. Also, children's meals were not identified on the menu.",Negative,,,,,
The hotel itself is awesome.  Employees did not seem real excited to be working there.,Positive,,,,,
Thermometer in rm 521 didn't work,Negative,,,,,
Lobby was fine but room was dated and needed maintenance. Parking was a hassle.,Negative,,,,,
"The toilets are old and inadequate by todayâ€™s standards. They are small, round seats over low round bowls. Seats are badly scratched too. Not large enough for people today. Needs an upgrade!",Negative,,,,,
Did not care for paying for parking.,Positive,,,,,
"Wish there was some kind of discount for people staying at the hotel for food and beverages 
It was too expensive to eat there but no other choices to go due to the snow",Positive,,,,,
The room condition didn't match the condition of the convention center.,Positive,,,,,
Great hotel.,Positive,,,,,
"I had a corner room and it was outdated, didn't seem as clean as other rooms I've stayed in previously.  In the future I will likely just ask for a room that is not a corner room.",Negative,,,,,
Breakfast and free coffee should be included with price. $5.00 for 1 coffee is out of control. I usually have 3 or 4 cups.,Positive,,,,,
"I had a room block code. I came to the front desk to register for a hotel room, but the staff member said she didn't have access to room blocks. So she wrote down the 1-800 number on a post it and I had to call the number to book a hotel room.... when I was literally standing at the front desk. So that was pretty silly and I would consider poor customer service. Moral of the story is the front desk person should definitely have access to room blocks. The rest of my stay was great and I loved the hotel.",Positive,,,,,
Your hotel worked great with the dartball venue in the KI center. There were many people wishing you would have had live music or Dj in the bar area,Positive,,,,,
One of the more pricey hotels we've stayed at and there was nothing that made it stand out from the others,Negative,,,,,
"I really liked the layout of the room.  
I liked the easy access to USB ports",Negative,,,,,
My only complaint was that I had given my tax exempt information to the front desk and although she was busy she asked for it and then did not take the tax off my invoice before charging my card.  I am still waiting for the refund.,Negative,,,,,
Having some of your guest pay for parking and others not is a problem for me.  You should be able to fix that.,Negative,,,,,
"Ordered from Pub 333. Food was disappointing. Soggy, undercooked fries and the sandwich was not what I expected; especially for the price. Everything else about my stay was wonderful. Very nice, efficient and friendly staff!",Positive,,,,,
"Was disappointed in the mobile check in.  Went to my 5th level room and skipped the desk as that is what the app said to do.  Spent 20 minutes there, called desk twice, ended having to lug everything back down stairs.  Wasted about 45 minutes of my time that I could have used elsewise.",Positive,,,,,
Pool area very clean and relaxing,Positive,,,,,
"Sofa sleeper was very worn and uncomfortable, could have used more blankets for bedroom, didn't have enough large towels for number of people Olinda our room. There were loud, drunk people playing Marco polo late and kept us awake until 2am",Negative,,,,,
The parking situation for guests is rough. Had trouble finding parking in the lot. I feel that the lot should be strictly for guests of the hotel not the convention center.,Negative,,,,,
Great place,Positive,,,,,
The noise from the street was very loud. Room 812. I wish I would have known this before checking in.,Negative,,,,,
This hotel was a wonderful surprise and I would recommend it to anyone staying in the area!,Positive,,,,,
The only suggestion for improvement would be higher toilets. Those toilets sit so low to the ground! (8th floor).,Positive,,,,,
Parking is a bit of a challenge at this location.,Positive,,,,,
Only strange thing was a small round table with 1 chair,Neutral,,,,,
Staff overall was average. I wouldn't say that there's anything exceptional or even worth recommending. Unfortunately that's kind of the case everywhere now so we just accept it but it's nice when you go on vacation to have a little extra.,Positive,,,,,
"I paid over 200 dollars for one night and did not have any breakfast options included in my stay. It would be nice, when paying that much for a room to have complementary breakfast offered for guests.",Positive,,,,,
The only issue I had was when I asked about parking they did not tell me it was $10 a day until I received my bill.  I asked if there was a charge and was told no upon check in.,Positive,,,,,
I don't think guest should have to pay 10.00 for parking a night.,Negative,,,,,
"The parking situation is a real issue. There is not enough parking for even a tenth of your guests and this hotel is a convention center!  In addition, it is ridiculous that there is a charge for parking when the parking is so poor.",Negative,,,,,
Room 312 was too loud and would prefer to stay on non street side,Negative,,,,,
It would be nice for more options included as far as some kind of continental breakfast.  The small store is very slow and completely overpriced.,Positive,,,,,
Love staying here for my daughterâ€™s dance competitions. One suggestion would be to rope or block off atrium area when people are seated for breakfast. It is rather annoying having people walk through with their luggage etc while youâ€™re getting served and eating.,Positive,,,,,
Parking should be free for any guest staying at your facility. We were told after we checked out that parking in public garage across street was free to all guests. Well I paid $20 to stay in your lot and most of the spaces were covered in snow banks,Negative,,,,,
Free breakfast would of been nice,Positive,,,,,
"We have stayed at this location several times for athletic events. Just a few things that hold me back from giving all 10s. First, the elevators are so slow. It seems to take forever. Not sure much can be done but I have stayed at the Hampton next door because I didn't want to deal with the elevators at this Hyatt location. Second, the wait at the Starbucks coffee shop is incredibly long. I also would have appreciated some other things sold such as small containers of milk and other similar items. There's not much in there and it would be such a convenience to sell things like milk, small microwaveable meals, etc. I have seen this at other hotels we've stayed at. Finally, housekeeping was a little too eager to get into our room. We had a knock on our door announcing it was housekeeping and before I could even get to the door or say anything, she was letting herself in. I would have been upset if someone were to be changing, etc.",Positive,,,,,
Upgrade the elevators!!!,Neutral,,,,,
"The rooms are dark with all of the brown, so it's harder to work even turning on all of the lights. A desk lamp instead of a regular lamp that shines on the desk and not on what I'm working on would have been better. I liked the products for the bathroom and how it was set up.",Positive,,,,,
The bed was very hard and hurt our backs. We were not happy about paying to park. Especially Friday when you couldnâ€™t get a parking spot. It was very loud in the atrium Friday due to a dance competition. We couldnâ€™t use the pool or hot tub due to the overcrowding on Friday night. The room and hotel were lovely as well as the staff. We just didnâ€™t have a restful time.,Positive,,,,,
"We look forward to this dance competition every year and our stay here, even though we live close enough to drive home each night.",Positive,,,,,
Only thing the one night person wasnâ€™t sure what policy was on earlier than expected checkouts,Neutral,,,,,
"The 24 hour fitness center was closed when I woke in the morning to workout, I had to go to the front desk and then I had to wait for staff to come unlock it.",Negative,,,,,
"Stayed two nights while attending PAWLI Conf., room was large and clean, although I found and had to kill a Cock Roach in the Bathroom floor.  Also, the Breakfast Muffins and Sweet Rolls that were served at Conf. were OK but kind of dry.  Other food served in Bar was good and Staff was friendly and courteous.  Enjoyed having Business Center Computer with Printer as I had last minute work emergency I had to deal with and I was able to complete.",Positive,,,,,
"And Tracy, too, who came to our lunch table to chat. She was so friendly and sincere. I told her how Samantha impressed me, and Tracy said she would make sure that Sam was recognized! Tracy is a wonderful!",Positive,,,,,
Loved the large TV but needed more space int he bathrooma nd a confor height toilet please.,Positive,,,,,
Just need free breakfast,Positive,,,,,
"The only I wish that was different from our stay was when we asked where to park we were just told to park in the parking lot with a fee, but were never told there was an option for free parking. That's the only ""negative"" feedback I would say. Otherwise, the room was clean, staff was nice, and although I didn't use the amenities, they looked nicer than other hotels I've stayed in.",Positive,,,,,
In need of some updating. The hotel is â€œold and tiredâ€,Negative,,,,,
"Need Newer showers, and the treadmillâ€™s are very outdated. The TVs do not work on the treadmillâ€™s.",Negative,,,,,
Bathroom could use a fan.,Neutral,,,,,
"My only complaint was that the sound carried very loudly from bathroom to bathroom - must be due to how the vents are. It almost sounded like there was something standing in my room, it was so loud!",Negative,,,,,
Toilets were very low.  Room temp hard to regulate.,Negative,,,,,
"I thought I read that due to the length on my stay housekeeping would not be in which was ok. So, I left things out in my room I otherwise would not have.  I then noticed housekeeping did come into the room.",Neutral,,,,,
Your service and staff are exceptional and I loved the entire experience.,Positive,,,,,
"I feel this room is very over priced. The room was nice but nothing special.  The area where the couch was had a funny smell that seemed to be chemical like. I did report it to the staff.  They asked if we wanted a different room, but needed one close to elevator due to my husbands health.  They did not offer a complimentary breakfast, which for the price should of been offered.",Positive,,,,,
The toilet in our room was a little loose and our server at breakfast was maybe not having her best day. Otherwise everything was fantastic.,Positive,,,,,
needs more updates,Neutral,,,,,
Great place to stay.,Positive,,,,,
"Everyone was really nice, which we appreciated. If we hadn't had the hot water issue, it would have been a perfect stay!",Positive,,,,,
Very pleased with daily garbage pick up and towel exchanges!  NEVER happens in other hotels anymore. Thank you!,Positive,,,,,
After the long day I had.  I wanted to sit in the hot tub and relax.  But unfortunately other guests let the kids swim in the hot tub.  And just ruined the peace of mind i was looking forward to,Negative,,,,,
Was told at check in since my husband booked the room I was unable to check in. I had to wait for him before they would help me. My arms were full of bags and I had to walk back out to the car to get my husband to start the check in process.,Negative,,,,,
Very clean with the exception of the sliding patio door.  Outside would be expected to be dirty especially in the winter but it was excessively dirty.  The interior of the door was also dirty which I expected to be as clean as the rest of the room.,Negative,,,,,
The food was very expensive for the quality. Several items were obviously frozen and heated. There were no good kid options either.,Positive,,,,,
The gentleman at Check-In was wonderful.  I think his name was James (but not 100%),Positive,,,,,
No parking. The first night I couldnâ€™t get in the parking lot because the cops had it blocked off and the second night the parking lot was full and I had to park and pay for the parking ramp across the street both nights,Negative,,,,,
Disappointed in our stay. Breakfast expensive and not good. Walls super thin. Pillows as flat as paper. I was told I could cancel my room and then was told I could not. Kids did enjoy hot tub and pool.,Positive,,,,,
"Unfortunately, thanks to your novice staff, we didnâ€™t get to stay and had to drive home.  Iâ€™d rather pay for a night at another hotel than use a free night here.",Positive,,,,,
So disappointed as this isnâ€™t what I have experienced at this hotel before. I have been going there since I was little and now I would think twice of ever going back for special occasions. Most of the staff was pleasant but the true care factor was a complete miss.,Positive,,,,,
"The host for breakfast was outstanding. The person serving my meal not so much. The person I spoke to, male, after dinner at check in desk, on what T V station to watch the girls state basketball tournament exceeded my expectations on helping me.",Positive,,,,,
"This was a lovely hotel and the room was much more spacious than I expected. It was clean,  and I feel we got a bargain, especially when we saw the prices listed on the back of the door!",Positive,,,,,
Unsure why I had to stop at front desk to check in when I had checked in via the app and it already charged my card on file and there are digital keys. I was not greeted as Explorist and didnâ€™t have waters in my room.,Negative,,,,,
It was very nice!,Positive,,,,,
"Forgot to fill coffee in room, one day, it's ok.",Neutral,,,,,
Only issue for me was the slow elevators.,Negative,,,,,
"The toilet in the bathroom was incredibly low to the ground, no fan in the bathroom.  Otherwise room was nice.",Positive,,,,,
The rooms are amazing.  The elevators... not so much.  Clearer signage of where stairs are (we were on 2nd floor and didn't need to wait for the elevator but never could figure out where the stairs were) would be helpful.,Positive,,,,,
Elevators are awful. Incredibly slow. Potentially not enough of them.,Negative,,,,,
Have courtesy phone calls if rooms are running late. We were so upset and disappointed to miss our daughters banquet.,Negative,,,,,
Excellent property!!,Positive,,,,,
"Very limited food choices for both breakfast and dinner from the Pub.  The serving size of the Pub food was small.  Thought that the food was overpriced for what you receive.  Also, took way longer to receive food than should have taken.",Positive,,,,,
Wood portion of the bathroom vanity and in the bedroom looked old and unkept.,Positive,,,,,
"Itâ€™s a wonderful hotel, but it really needs a facelift",Positive,,,,,
The elevators were very slow and took forever to get from the 7th floor to the ground floor,Negative,,,,,
"Great hotel, love the layout of the rooms, the perks of the coffee pot, sink, fridge, microwave. The hotel is a little bit rough around the edges, but overall a great place to stay!",Positive,,,,,
We've stayed before so expectations  were known so hard to exceed if our expectations were how good it was the previous 3 or 4 times we stayed there,Positive,,,,,
"Menu on website does not match menu at restaurant. They change their menu after 5. Parking SUCKS. You should not have to pay to park in your hotel parking lot!!!! THe whole ticket thing was confusing and not explained well. For the price of a room, I expected more updated rooms. Overall experience was blah. I will not be in a hurry to book a room at Hyatt in the future. I should have stayed next door and had free parking, and free breakfast.",Positive,,,,,
"Question full cleaning of the room, over by the lamp in the corner as I found a sock slightly positioned to the side/behind the lamp, which makes me wonder if the room was vacuumed in the corner.  I also was wishing the elevators would move faster; long wait times.  I understand there was a lot of people at the hotel over the weekend, but that was hard to have to wait.",Positive,,,,,
"More parking is needed i had to park in the bank, the lot was jam pack.",Neutral,,,,,
"Check carpet in room 431, tripping hazard.",Negative,,,,,
"The room thermostat being adjustable would've made our stay significantly better.  There was no bathroom fan, and every time we showered it made it very stuffy in the entire room.  It was very warm in the room and made it hard to sleep well, but the AC didn't kick in even if the thermostat temp was manually lowered.",Positive,,,,,
"9 million little girls took over the hotel. Had I known I wouldâ€™ve found a different hotel. Pool area was completely overrun by kids, hotel was a mess from the kids and they ran around in circles everywhere like kids on crack. And there was no parking.",Negative,,,,,
The wrought iron railings were very dangerous in my opinion and would not stay there again,Negative,,,,,
Shower water pressure was low.,Negative,,,,,
The pool/pool room was a bit chilly. We loved the steam room though!,Neutral,,,,,
Hope to return. Enjoyed the stay,Positive,,,,,
"While the public spaces are up to date, the rooms really need updating. The bathrooms, especially!",Neutral,,,,,
"lack of flexibility to provide early check in; inital staffer was unprofessional with response; then manager made it a jump through hoops situation.
elevators painfully slow and inefficient for # of guests",Negative,,,,,
Overall it was a horrible stay for myself and guest.,Positive,,,,,
"I did notify the front desk that the water in the hot tub was dirty (brown colored), and the sauna did not appear to be working.  This is a beautiful hotel, with a lot to offer.  I look forward to my next stay!",Positive,,,,,
Very well managed property!,Positive,,,,,
Overall it was a very good experience and I would stay there again but I would check to see what was going on in the convention center first.,Positive,,,,,
"Everything was wonderful, my family really enjoyed the pool and big rooms. We only had a problem with our room keys not working. I think we went through about 9 different keys. It was very annoying having to go up and down back and forth just to get into the room every time.",Positive,,,,,
"Place is old.  Staff was ok but one server for restaurant smelled like BO.  It was pretty bad.  Room was expensive for what we got.  
But overall ok stay",Neutral,,,,,
"The food was absolutely horrible at the restaurant. My hamburger was exactly the size of a small McDonaldâ€™s hamburger for a $1.00, not even the size of a quarter pounder, and I paid $16. My husbandâ€™s $20 French dip was extremely small. I was charged $6.95 for an iced tea, that was completely tasteless. My husbandâ€™s old-fashioned was horrible.",Positive,,,,,
Requested more towels in app and very impressed by responsiveness.,Positive,,,,,
Please contact me and Iâ€™m happy to explain,Positive,,,,,
I might suggest that housekeeping check if alarms are on.  I know that it is one more thing on their already full plates but waking up to an alarm clock that a previous guest left on is quite frustrating.,Negative,,,,,
I forgot my swim suit in the room. If you find it hanging on the sliding glass door please let me know and my daughter who lives in Green Bay can pick it up.,Positive,,,,,
Meals in the hotel bar were tasty and service was good. Breakfast line was way too long to attempt and a bit overpriced.,Positive,,,,,
"The only issues we experienced was confusion in not booking our room as part of the wedding block. The only negative experiences were the slowness of the elevators and road noise from room, and full parking lot.",Positive,,,,,
"I understand that I stayed there during a blizzard, but the patio door/window in the bedroom was very drafty.  When I first arrived in the room, the door was not even latched shut and there was a noticeable gap that the wind was coming right through.  Even after latching it, there was still a draft coming through.",Positive,,,,,
"Was told as members we could get in at 1:00. We were there for area wedding so showed up for 1:00 and couldnâ€™t all get our rooms to get ready for wedding. So called manager at front desk extremely rude, pretty much calling us liars about talking with someone that morning. We were not offered our gift bags from bride and groom, we had to ask for them after wedding that night when brides mother said we should have received. The next morning we went down for breakfast and asked for table of 8. The hostess acted like again it was an inconvenience even though there was only 2 other tables there. Then my daughter took my granddaughters to bathroom and she actually came to table and asked if she could take the 2 chairs back because no one was sitting in them. And again the other high table was not needed at the time. She actually said to put the room back in order! We told her no that we were not done eating which should have been obvious because our plates had food on them yet. Just very bad experience overall. Rooms were very nice but unfortunately the staff was unkind and unfriendly so would never recommend your hotel!! I hope that this feedback is taken seriously and some action is taken!! The only nice person was Samantha at the check in desk on Saturday!",Positive,,,,,
"I was disappointed with the charge of $30 for parking. I moved my vehicle to a covered ramp across the street after 12 hours. However, was still charged for 3 days of parking. I didn't have time to argue with the staff.",Negative,,,,,
Very surprisingly wonderful,Positive,,,,,
Only complaint is that we could hear the elevator in our room.,Negative,,,,,
Second try at this property will not be a third will stay at Koehler,Negative,,,,,
"The rooms were clean, but the building and rooms were run down.",Positive,,,,,
"Late check in because room was not cleaned yet - never received a text to alert me.
Pool didn't open until 8am - I had planned to lap swim in the morning before the conference.  
As part of our conference, everyone was supposed to have received breakfast tickets at check in - I did not.",Positive,,,,,
Shouldn't have to pay for parking when you oy over $100 for the hotel room,Negative,,,,,
Experience was great just wish the pull out couches were more comfortable.,Positive,,,,,
Not sure of the whole parking situation really a pain. Especially when we returned late at night and lot was full and had to park across the street.,Negative,,,,,
Great place to visit,Positive,,,,,
Parking situation was not ideal.,Positive,,,,,
"I assume they were experiencing a shortage of cleaning staff, but no explanation was givenâ€¦just that my room was still not ready. There was a conference in the attached convention center so we were not the only ones waiting over 5 hours to get checked into room.

The breakfast buffet food and drink offered a good variety and well prepared, but the seating area takes up a portion of the lobby and not well partitioned and signage was lacking . Being the only sit-down tables I could use in the early morning to work on laptop, I sat there without realizing it was designated for food service area and thus told I had to move to another are of the lobby by hostess when they started setting up (even though I was going to be eating once they opened). I understand that it is probably frustrating for her to show up and see people already sitting in the apparently closed-off sectionâ€¦but again it was not clearly marked and the food service set up had changed from the last time I stayed there - same time frame, most every year over the past 20 years. Being tired from a poor nightâ€™s sleep definitely contributed to my irritation with that experience.",Positive,,,,,
Part of my group that arrived the next day did not receive their reserved room key until 11:30pm!   I had to stay up extremely late hosting them in my room rather than making them wait all night in the lobby with their luggage.  This made my usually enjoyable experience at the conference into an exhausted one and makes me question continuing to recommend my colleagues stay at the same place as the conference venue.,Positive,,,,,
There should be adult hour in the pool. The kids were loud and obnoxious. One kid threw another kid and it it another kid causing a bloody nose in the pool.,Negative,,,,,
I was not aware at the time of the booking that parking was $10 a night.  When I had my ticket validated I was assuming that there was no fee for parking.  Only discovered the fee at checkout.  The gated parking lot was full and we had to park across the street and still pay $10! Also the refrigerator door did not close properly...had to be pushed very hard.  Therefore all our dinner leftovers were not kept cold at night and had to be thrown away.,Positive,,,,,
"Room was clean and orderly upon arrival - loved the amount of space! Check in staff was wonderful. We used all the sleeping space our room offered, including the sofa bed. The actual beds were very comfortable, and the kids didnâ€™t complain about the sofa bed. Except the noise. Oh my gosh, it was awful. You could hear other peoplesâ€™ doors closing constantly all night. Everyone that walked and RAN by the room - we could hear it. There were even people who were trying to get into our room! How inappropriate! 

We had dinner at the pub and the food was decent enough, but the server and/or kitchen staff messed up our order and my kidâ€™s grilled cheese was not even cooked - just cold unmelted cheese put on bread. The manager did comp the grilled cheese for having to wait and brought out a new one, which was good. However, the quality of the food and service did not match the costly bill. Breakfast was a pretty pitiful buffet. The staff allowed me to buy a plate and take my food back to my room, which is wonderful. However, all of the food was cold. It was a 1 min walk from the buffet to my room; thereâ€™s no way my food got that cold in that little amount of time (eggs, potatoes, sausage links - all cold). The sausage links were pink in the center and I had to reheat them in the hotel room microwave so we could eat them. Was disappointed that there wasnâ€™t bacon and not even pancakes or waffles. The sliced bread was dry. The only good thing from the buffet was the fruit loops. For $17, I expected much more out of the buffet. Itâ€™s not a good value.",Positive,,,,,
"I was expecting a corner suite with separate bedroom and small bar. However I booked on line and it kicked me to a corner room, one room. No bar. It was nice but no chairs or coffee table.  Disappointed bur hotel was booked and I understood",Negative,,,,,
Donâ€™t charge for parking when thereâ€™s no room for vehicles I got charged 10.00 for a spot that wasnâ€™t available,Negative,,,,,
"With no free breakfast or coffee in the lobby, it is a bit annoying to pay for parking too.",Positive,,,,,
Buffet breakfast both days was cold. Bar staff was overwhelmed for amount of business.,Negative,,,,,
i was a member of a very large group and all went well. thank you,Positive,,,,,
The elevator situation could use more capacity or a stairway that was easy to find and use if you needed to be in a hurry.,Positive,,,,,
"The staff was very helpful and courteous, the room was clean and spacious. My only complaints are these. Only one box of kleenex, out of sight in bedroom. The toilet is a round front toilet instead of elongated. The G.M. (if it's a male) of Hyatt should sit down on a round front toilet as if to have a bowel movement. When he can't figure out where to put his genitals, he'll understand why no hotel bathroom with ample space should ever have a round front toilet!",Positive,,,,,
Try to have more people on hand when you know you are going to be busyâ€¦,Positive,,,,,
Elevatorâ€™s way to slow,Negative,,,,,
"Dinner for the banquet was ok, however they shut down a line too early to meet the needs of the people there.  There bartending staff was great!  

Breakfast was a joke.  Wait in line for 15 minutes to give a room number to be billed and the be given a separate bill by another staff asking for a tip.  You ran out of fruit and potatoes and when asked we were told you were not bringing any more out.  The eggs seemed like powdered, the bacon appeared to be cooked in an oven or deep fryer and was burnt.  The pancakes were really good.",Positive,,,,,
customer service could have been better. Didnt feel welcomed. Felt like we were an issue and they had other things going on.,Positive,,,,,
"Hotel is very nice. We had a corner room, loved it! Very private and quiet. Loved it. Would stay there again. Having said that, not a fan of the $10 parking fee. Green Bay is not a high crime city to pay a fee for a secure parking lot.",Positive,,,,,
Very friendly,Positive,,,,,
"In room safe
Higher toilets in guest rooms
Brighten up hotel, hotel public areas and guest rooms are very dark and dated.",Positive,,,,,
Was not able to get breakfast line was out to the door,Positive,,,,,
The stay was better than expected. The two issues I find was no ventilation in the bathroom and no facial tissues were offered in any room.,Positive,,,,,
Lunch and breakfast especially for the price of $16 that you tryâ€™d to charge for something that was supposed to be included in the stay was a simple and standard cheap motel breakfast was ridiculous. Lunch was all tortilla and no meat. Everyone was disappointed and when a company event comes like that you would think food would be a bit better. Half our guys didnâ€™t even get breakfast when trying to wait in line to be seatedâ€¦..it was honestly a mess. Not trying to be a Karen but you guys definitely need improvement on that front. Room was great,Positive,,,,,
"way under staffed for breakfast, lunch and night time in the bar",Positive,,,,,
the food had no flavor the meat was full of fat and gristle. my box lunch was all wrap and lettuce with a paper thin slice of ham and the cookie was burnt solid.,Negative,,,,,
"zero complaints, everything was fantastic",Negative,,,,,
party was going on at 4 am one floor up,Neutral,,,,,
The coffee shop wasnâ€™t open on Saturday at 6:30 am. We had to leave for a bball tournament at 7 and weâ€™re barely able to get coffee or quick breakfast sandwiches. Also reception argued with me and had me pay for Venti coffees when I asked for grande. So I was charged for Ventis when I asked for grande cups.,Positive,,,,,
Also getting in and out of the parking lot was a hassle.  Our key card didnâ€™t seem to want to work at the gate going in and heading out.  Ended up having to hit the button for assistance so staff would raise the gate.,Positive,,,,,
Parking should be included for the price of a room.,Positive,,,,,
bathrooms could use a bit of an update. Also we ended up not eating a lot in the restaurant given the prices? maybe could use some happy hour specials better advertised?,Positive,,,,,
"Excellent! The hotel was beautiful, the room was super clean,and the check in staff were very friendly, enthusiastic and helpful.",Positive,,,,,
disappointed a complimentary tooth paste was no longer available when I forgot mine.,Positive,,,,,
"Service in pub was disappointing because one person, Michael, was the ""star"" of the show, and he could only do so much to meet the guest's  expectation. Schedule help for Michael. Also, I reported to front desk that air vent in shower was very dirty and looked ugly. Why wouldn't house keeping supervisor check to see if the vent was frequently cleaned?",Positive,,,,,
Great everything,Neutral,,,,,
I stayed at the Hyatt for training and I start at 7 am. I wasnt able to have the normal breafast cause you dont start serving till 7:00 am,Neutral,,,,,
Free basic breakfast would have made this the perfect stay. That would be my ONLY complaint. It was beautiful and the room was amazing. Food was expensive so we didn't eat and no free hot chocolate in the room.,Positive,,,,,
"Breakfast should start at 6 am, during week. Hard to have it at 7",Positive,,,,,
Joyce at the front desk was amazing in how she handled getting the taxes taken off (state employee) and made sure I had everything I needed. This has been my third time checking in with Joyce and her dedication and customer service style is great.,Positive,,,,,
Christian in the restaurant provided amazing service!,Positive,,,,,
The place needs an update...,Neutral,,,,,
"Iâ€™ve stayed her many time but this is the first time Iâ€™ve had an issue with the room, and as long as Iâ€™ve been here Iâ€™ve never known where to get ice",Positive,,,,,
The only 2 complaints were the bed was not comfortable to me and the bartenders did not know how to make an old fashion drink. Everything else was great!,Neutral,,,,,
"The shampoo, conditioner, body wash and lotion provided is a nice touch.",Positive,,,,,
Waiting and service staff in the restaurant need improvement. Service was slow and food was just ok.,Positive,,,,,
"My husband is in a wheelchair, so we stay in a lot of hotels that claim to be accessible, yet are not. You knocked it out of the park. We were blown away impressedâ€”it was as if you actually consulted someone in a wheelchair during design. Two bed optionsâ€”one higher so if someone stands & pivots it would be easier for them. One lower and actually at the level my husband needs to transfer comfortably without standing (at wheelchair height). Room under each bed for a hoyer should someone need it. Bathroom large enough to turn a chair around in, and the roll in shower was actually roll in (not a 2-3 inch bottom piece impossible to roll over). The room itself was large enough for a wheelchair to actually move around. He rarely has a choice on where he can wedge himself in a room, which side of the bed he can squeeze between, etc. This was a dream. Please consider hosting other hotels to show them how itâ€™s done. You have no idea how much this attention to detail can mean to someone who physically needs this and yet is usually ignored. (We once had a hotel tell us he had to use the bathroom in the hall because it was the only accessible bathroom they hadâ€”or one who insisted the accessible room was on the second floor but they didnâ€™t have an elevatorâ€¦) Thank you. We will be sharing our experience with others who are in need of accessibility. Thank you for caring enough to make this happen.",Positive,,,,,
Everything was good except toilets donâ€™t really work well Iâ€™ve noticed all the times Iâ€™ve stayed,Positive,,,,,
"I am upset we got charged for parking and it was supposed to be free, along with other people I have talked to did not get charged for parking i would like my 20 dollars back for parking.",Positive,,,,,
Wi-Fi not working well.,Positive,,,,,
The complimentary toothbrush was terrible with the bristles coming off With one use. Pool area looked dingy.,Negative,,,,,
"Breakfast should be free. I got charged a $5 parking fee, not sure why.",Positive,,,,,
Keep kids out if hot tub. Have never paid for parking at a hotel in my life. Besides the fact there is no mention in booking of parking fee. Not posted anywhere. Don't like those kind of surprises when my stay is paid for already. They take $10 out of the $50 hold on CC,Negative,,,,,
"Staff was incredibly friendly! We are staying again this week. Very impressed and looking forward to coming back. 

One minor thing was the cost of some of the food in the market. $5.50 for a Simple Mills granola bar is pretty outrageous but I bought one anyways. Maybe $4? A whole box is $5. 

Food at the resturant/pub was excellent as was the service. 

Kudos!",Positive,,,,,
"Disappointed that you now have to pay $10 per night parking.  This is not Chicago. Use to be $0, then $5, now $10.",Negative,,,,,
Blacked seasoned Steak dinner was too seasoned and salty. Could not eat it.,Positive,,,,,
"I gave the condition of the hotel a lower score because (i) my room was noisy at night (ventilation fan and outside noise from the traffic below), (ii) the meeting rooms were cold and it seemed to take a long time to heat them up, and (iii) we had repeated microphone issues over the two days.",Negative,,,,,
Parking was an absolute nightmare.,Negative,,,,,
"Should update to comfort level toilets
A/C does not work well. 
Bathrooms should have fans",Positive,,,,,
I thought the breakfast was to expensive considering you had to serve yourself.,Positive,,,,,
Very slow elevators and loud late into the evening,Negative,,,,,
"We arrived at about 9:30pm after driving 3 hours.  There was a fire truck, ambulance, and police car in the entrance way. No way to park. I parked in the very first spot to run in and go to the bathroom, get my little girls inside, check in, and take my bags in. Apparently, this spot is for your GM. I came out to find your GM sitting behind my car. She rolled her window down asking if I was about to move. I said no Iâ€™m trying to get all my bags in first. At this time the first responders left. She then proceeds to tell me I need to move or I will be towed because this is HER SPOT! I put all my bags back in the car along with my little girls and proceeded to move so she didnâ€™t have me towed. I went inside and watched her walk to the front desk and then discuss with the front desk talking about me. I then asked the front desk who that was and why she was allowed to park there. They said itâ€™s their GM. Clearly someone with the GM was handicapped  and needed a  closer spot, so Iâ€™m not trying to be insensitive to that. . . But thatâ€™s what handicapped spots are for which were not being used by anyone. I had to park in a bank parking lot which said 2 hr customer parking only. I couldnâ€™t sleep thinking all night I was going to be towed. I walked over to check on my car at 8:30am and to try to again park in the hotel lot that I paid for. Still nothing. Completely horrible experience. And what a slap in the face to your paying customers that your GM has a front row spot while the rest of us walk with our little kids in the cold to find a parking spot. I wonâ€™t stay there again. The whole reason I picked your location was due to the convention center.",Negative,,,,,
Be more helpful to guests. My daughter left her phone there and when I called the person just directed me to the lost and found website. He wouldnâ€™t even check to see if someone found it!!  Just rude and caused me more stress. Not helpful at all. Oh and The elevators suck!,Positive,,,,,
Expand parking  close to hotel,Positive,,,,,
"You charge for breakfast where most hotels do not. I was never notified there was a breakfast charge, only asked for our room number. $30.00 later for a breakfast I never would have paid for. Eggs were dry and gross, oatmeal was wonderful.",Positive,,,,,
I REALLY appreciate that there was 4 towels and 2 rolls of toilet paper for the 4 people in the room.  However there were only 2 people washcloths.  Would be nice to have 4 so we didnâ€™t have to bother anyone.,Positive,,,,,
"I really enjoy the Hyatt on Main st. in Green Bay. Hence my continuing to stay there. I wish that you would install handheld shower heads. Also the pool used to be the warmest in the area, I hope you consider turning the temperature back up.",Positive,,,,,
All staff was busy when ever one would see them. They were also very curtious,Positive,,,,,
"My son and his girlfriend went to the breakfast for a coffee.  They did not know how it all worked (the lady seating people did not understand her job either) and were not aware that the price was $16 for the buffet.  The girlfriend had an orange. She was charged $16 for an orange.  She was just sitting down with my son, grabbed an orange and the lady in charge charged her for a full breakfast.  She did not even get a drink because she went to Starbucks.  My son was confused and did not speak up.  Aside from them 2, I went down there with 4 people (me, my mom and 2 teenagers).  We were told that kids under 18 were 1/2 price.  When we got our bill, I was charged full price for both teenagers.  I told the lady taking our money what the hostess had said.  She said the lady was incorrect.  I told her she needed to tell the hostess then because she is telling people incorrect information.  The lady at the cash register did give me the girls 1/2 off but was not happy about this.  Because of this, I did not say anything about the $16 orange and figured when I got a survey, I would say something then.  I will also warn others on Booking.com and Trip Advisor to pay attention to the breakfast area in general because the people working there were not knowledgeable in their jobs.",Positive,,,,,
Bathroom doorway seemed kinda narrow. Smaller then a normal doorway.,Neutral,,,,,
Rooms need more hooks for towels. We were a family of 6 and weâ€™re short on being able to hang things to dry.,Negative,,,,,
A very nice stay for business.,Positive,,,,,
"The hotel was very noisy. Very loud banging above us until almost 3 am. Asked about this in the morning and I was told that they had â€œseveral issues with guests last nightâ€. There was a wedding party  that was very loud. Perhaps those guests who cannot with reminders adhere to some resemblance if quiet hours should be asked to leave. 
This was just not my usual stellar Hyatt experience, which was disappointing as this was my home community and I expected more.",Positive,,,,,
I used Hyatt points to book the room and was very disappointed to see a charge for parking on my credit card account.  In the past this was never charged with using points.,Negative,,,,,
Would never return,Negative,,,,,
$10 to park my car in Green Bay?  REALLY?,Neutral,,,,,
"For entrances to Hotel lobby, have them available for a key pass entry to doors you lock. So hotel guest do not have to walk around the block to get in.",Positive,,,,,
"After a stressful day and night, these two employees were right on for what I needed. My stress ended when I walked in the door.",Positive,,,,,
Glad to be an email member! Your specific Green Bay location is breathtaking.,Positive,,,,,
"It was supposed to be a nice getaway weekend to celebrate our 15 yr anniversary. Unfortunately, staying at the Hyatt which we expected to be a higher end hotel didn't deliver the experience we were hoping for.",Positive,,,,,
I wish the breakfast was open past ten. Many of us wanted to eat at ten,Positive,,,,,
Guest services and housekeeping were outstanding.,Positive,,,,,
Slow response dining,Negative,,,,,
"The breakfast atmosphere was rough I hate to say. The main server sneezing and yelling about a dog sheâ€™s allergic to. Poor girl, but couldnâ€™t someone give her a hand so she can run into a restroom, blow her nose, take antihistamine and recover a bit. It was just real loud, continuous and not in sync with a mellow Autograph morning. 
Hope she feels better though. Overall the hotel is beautiful.",Positive,,,,,
Terrible 1980â€™s pop played the entire time and could be heard through the door of my room. Awful.,Negative,,,,,
"We received very good service. The room and the food was excellent. The staff was very professional & we received excellent customer service. All the accommodations were very comfortable. We would recommend 
staying there to everyone.",Positive,,,,,
"Unfortunately, I had too much fun the night I stayed and caused damage to the hotel when I fell.  I paid for said damage and the staff was very gracious, polite and understanding while working through this most embarrassing situation.",Positive,,,,,
Very loud in the room,Negative,,,,,
Excellent,Positive,,,,,
This hotel was much cleaner than other comparable hotels I've recently visited!,Positive,,,,,
It would be amazing if the toiletries were stocked for guests and parking was free to guests.,Positive,,,,,
Price was much lower online and by phone when i was at check-in counter.. asked if i could get a price adjustment they said I paid already and wouldn't adjust pricing. Seems like bad hotel business. I guess you get penalized for paying in advance.,Positive,,,,,
"The other issue was when we came to town the pool area was taken over by about 40 family members. They had a buffet of food and alcohol set up and there was no way we could swim etc. We waited in hopes that they would leave and we could enjoy the amenities, but they were they until at least 9:30 pm and we didn't go back to look. Then when I explained the situation to management the next day I was told that he wasn't there that night and couldn't do anything for me. Maybe just an apology and we will make sure if happens again we will help you out would suffice.",Positive,,,,,
"We will stay again, loved the hotel!",Positive,,,,,
Our room was very clean but the common areas of the hotel could have been cleaner.,Positive,,,,,
Your hotel was awesome We had a pleasure staying there,Positive,,,,,
The parking process with validating parking and using the room key as a way to enter the parking lot was a little clunky and not overly efficient.  If that could've been explained a bit ahead of time I feel like that would've been helpful.,Positive,,,,,
The beds and bedding were VERY comfortable and everything was in great working order. Great location and very friendly staff!  Will visit again for sure.,Positive,,,,,
Hotel needs updating,Neutral,,,,,
"When booking our stay one reason we chose the Hyatt was that there was a sauna and steam room, neither of these was in working condition so I took that into consideration with this survey.",Positive,,,,,
"Erica was very helpful.
James helped me out.
They're very professional.
Good employee are hard to find, they both are excellent doing what they do!",Positive,,,,,
"I would like to highlight the very upbeat, friendly and professional reception and interaction I had with Maggie in the breakfast area (she was the hostess that greeted and seated me). She was warm and welcoming and extremely service-oriented.",Positive,,,,,
We didn't try the breakfast because it was a little pricey. We enjoyed the pool but it was a loud on Saturday night. I know you were full but there were people with glass bottles even though it was posted to not have any and they were being loud and pushing each other around (in play) It would have been nice to have someone from management stop by and check things out.,Positive,,,,,
"I will easily come back to this property again for work or for leisure. Great job!  Also, we woke up late and didnâ€™t have time for breakfast in the morning.",Positive,,,,,
"Started out with a computer search. Room was advertised at $91 and included breakfast (or so we thought). But, by the time we added our daughters the room jumped to $110 (I think? for the exact same room). But figured that was OK b/c the breakfast buffet looked scrumptious and the girls would have to eat before we visit UW-GB. But alas my Hyatt level I was at did not allow that either. We just ate elsewhere. So we'll stay someplace else as my daughter will be attending UW GB. With her sister in Appleton we found a nice hotel there and we'll stay there in the future.",Positive,,,,,
Very comfortable beds! Very nice room.,Positive,,,,,
Front desk staff was very helpful.,Positive,,,,,
Stayed on the 8th floor. Had to put up with an extended period of banging noises. Sounded like you had some construction or maintenance going on. Extremely disruptive.,Positive,,,,,
Very pleasant atmosphere.,Positive,,,,,
Love staying here,Positive,,,,,
Informing us of the $10 daily parking fee upfront wouldâ€™ve been nice at check in. It wasnâ€™t until check out that I saw the bill for it and we asked at check in if there was a fee and they said no.,Negative,,,,,
"The reception person who checked us in was rather gruff and not at all friendly. Not a good start, but with everything else being good, it was a good recovery.",Positive,,,,,
Not excited about having to pay for parking when already renting a hotel room but the overall stay was good.,Positive,,,,,
I sent a written letter thanking you all for a terrific birthday weekend!,Positive,,,,,
"We were a party of 4 adults in town for the Packers v Vikings game. We loved the atrium and structure of the hotel. We really enjoyed the spaciousness of our room, the separate living/kitchen space to spread out in, the granite countertops which we dined and played games on, and the other amenities provided. We really enjoyed that k-cups and a small Keurig was provided in the room. The refrigerator, microwave and sink were one of the main reasons we chose this hotel, along with the availability of food on the premises. The availability of Starbucks lattes at the Market was so refreshing! The breakfast at Pub 33 seemed slightly overpriced for what you received but, as previously mentioned, we appreciated the fact that the hotel had food available Some aspects of the room were a little worn but this did not affect our overall experience. We loved that the bus route ran to and from Lambeau Field. We walked to Hagemeister Park for dinner and drinks, played arcade games at Player 2, and thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful lights of downtown Green Bay along the way! We requested a quiet room and they accommodated our request. We were in need of some â€œwhite noiseâ€ to help us sleep and couldnâ€™t find a way to run just a â€œfanâ€ feature on the thermostat so we asked for a fan at guest services and someone brought one right up! It was great! Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again.",Positive,,,,,
The hold you put on your card should be held for so long. I have been waiting for the money back for a while when they said 3 days. Itâ€™s been more then 3 days,Positive,,,,,
Parking and parking tickets / charges were a problem.  Not clear from staff but we worked out a fair resolution.,Positive,,,,,
"Your price per night stay was outrageous at a base fee of 499.00.  We paid it because of our travel to Green Bay for the game.  No other way to say it other than it was price gauging on your part as the hotel stay wasn't close to a value of $500.00.  Sunday night you charged us for parking and didn't even have enough spots for guests to park in the protected lot.  We had to park across the street in a open parking lot and you still charged us $10.00.  You should really consider your business model and how you treat your customers, if you charge a fee make sure there is a valid reason.  Everyone knows what this was, an extremely tacky strategy to make quick $$ off of people.",Positive,,,,,
"Breakfast service was excellent, but if I pay for breakfast I do not expect it to be limited to a beverage and one entree, even toast is extra!",Positive,,,,,
Please repair the items that are not working in the pool area. Staff all over the hotel were excellent. Thank you!!,Positive,,,,,
Didn't realize parking cost wasn't included in the room cost,Positive,,,,,
I stay at this hotel because through the years itâ€™s been clean the last 2 times I stayed my room was not clean debris on the floor something was spilled on the side of the counter/island and it was never wiped down,Positive,,,,,

Again hotel did not address (they said there was â€œno answerâ€ at that room).  Very disappointed with how this was handled.",Negative,,,,,

Very comfortable.,Positive,,,,,
Top in the Green Bay market,Positive,,,,,
Improve your rooms for better guests... Got down your price on your breakfast could you can get better across the street half the price .... Plus the parking's isoutrageous... Shouldn't be charging people for staying there should be charging people who want to come to visit people staying there...,Positive,,,,,
Mentioned small service dog in reservation notes and still wanted to charge $100. Never seen such a absurd â€œPet Friendly â€œ charge,Neutral,,,,,
Loved the property- wish more were willing to have large differentiation on pool and amenities.  Large pool that was worn for swimming a welcome relief to winter!,Positive,,,,,
We would love to see an included breakfast.,Positive,,,,,
The second night was disappointing as it was so loud in the lobby or somewhere until 4:00 in the morning,Negative,,,,,
"I wish housekeeping hours where available throughout the day. I needed my room to be clean, but was told it's too late for that.",Positive,,,,,
otherwise everything was great,Positive,,,,,
"The restaurant staff was so friendly, though the kitchen was pretty slow.",Positive,,,,,
"When we checked out, front desk through your sales department under the bus for allowing a large group a late 3pm check out the day before ... this is not a customers problem (if it was known in advance then you should have hired extra cleaning staff and more front desk staff).  In addition, I had to ask to have my parking fee removed vs just being offered (I found out from another guest because they were also upset).",Positive,,,,,
Some parts of the hotel were dirty. The pool area is nice but needs an update. The windows were leaking and the hot tub looked a little weird.,Negative,,,,,
"I work for GBP and have been staying here for 15 years. Wonderful hotel, rooms, and service.",Positive,,,,,
There were VERY loud guests in the lobby at midnight on Saturday for at least 15-20 minutes. It took way too long for hotel staff/security to address this and escort them to their rooms.,Negative,,,,,
The staff was welcoming and friendly. The overall upkeep of the hotel was very good and the atrium is stunning. The rooms are surprisingly spacious and well laid out. The rooms and elevators are starting to show their age; something to stay on top of before it becomes too overwhelming to properly maintain.,Positive,,,,,
"The grab & go place for breakfast was convenient, but too pricey. I wouldnâ€™t eat there again for those prices.",Positive,,,,,
"Only issue was that the food in the on-sire restaurant was not good. Spoke to Jess about it, and she kindly comped both meals and said that a new Exec. Chek was starting that week. I look forward to seeing what changes will be made in the future.",Positive,,,,,
"Room 730, there is a constant droning noise in the bathroom. Not sure what is  on the other side as the room was next to the stairwell. Not the furnace as I could tell when that kicked in. Not as loud in the bedroom, but could hear it as I tried to fall asleep. Otherwise, all was good",Positive,,,,,
I would recommend changing out low toilets for higher ones,Positive,,,,,
Terrible nights sleep. Something in the closet kept making a noise every thirty seconds or so. Felt like torture. Toilet was so small and low to the ground I almost thought I was being pranked (Iâ€™m not a huge person either). Water pressure was comical and was quite the effort to just take a shower. Bed and pillows were some of the worst I have experienced in my travels. Room size was awesome though. I really liked how large the tv was as well.,Positive,,,,,
Very nice experience all around. The breakfast was delicious from the restaurant!,Positive,,,,,
I must say my experience was awesome,Positive,,,,,
Good customer service ;  nice room;  food in pub 22 OK,Positive,,,,,
"It would be helpful to have additional towel bars in the bathroom.  Also, the cost of parking should be included in the price of the room.",Positive,,,,,
Could use more garbage bags,Negative,,,,,
Only negative was the Restaurant was disappointing,Negative,,,,,
Please discontinue nightly additional parking fee for hotel guests.,Positive,,,,,
Drinks were amazing at the restaurant. A perfect old fashioned. But the food was very mediocre. You could tell the soup was re-heated.,Positive,,,,,
"During my visit, I encountered several issues with my room that significantly impacted my experience. Over the course of my stay, I had to move my belongings multiple times due to various problems, including a malfunctioning refrigerator, thermostat, and weak shower pressure. The final issue was a major leak in the bathroom ceiling, which resulted in my room being flooded and required me to relocate immediately.

While I greatly appreciated the prompt and efficient service provided by the maintenance team, these ongoing issues were disappointing and disruptive to my work trip. I had initially planned to stay for just under two weeks, but due to the recurring problems and the inconsistency between the rooms (for example, varying TV sizes and amenities), I had no choice but to cut my stay short.

Although the Assistant General Manager made efforts to address the concerns, by that point, the cumulative issues had already caused significant inconvenience. I hope to eventually reconsider staying at your hotel in the future, as I travel to the area frequently for work. However, I would only return if the rooms are updated to ensure a more consistent and comfortable experience.",Positive,,,,,
This is a great location but it really is showing its age,Neutral,,,,,
The work staff is extremely kind and accommodating. Only issue with the hotel is the condition of the rooms and the thermostats. My family and I have stayed in many different rooms here and itâ€™s always the same story: way too hot and dusty rooms that need refurbishment.,Positive,,,,,
Our door was propped open with the door lock upon our arrival to our room. We went to dinner in the bar area and upon our return maintenance knocked on our door. He had been the one to prop the door and said he wasnâ€™t notified any guests would be in that room. Hotel was without water day before and he was testing temps. Sinks had hot water but we found out the next morning the shower did not.  We had flatbread pizza and it was okay but not great. Upon checkout I did let front desk know that shower did not have hot water. I have a booking in 2025 for cheer competition and I hope the situation is fixed.,Positive,,,,,
"Sadly, the hot water did not work. wm",Negative,,,,,
I would never recommend the Hyatt Hotels to anyone.,Negative,,,,,
It was a great experience for my first stay in Green Bay,Positive,,,,,
The indoor tailgate party for the Packers/Dolphins game was a fun surprise. Someone in our party even had their face painted in the lobby for the game.,Positive,,,,,
The hotel feels very out of date Esp as this is a Hyatt regency.  This feels much cheaper then a usual Hyatt Regency,Positive,,,,,
The beds were awful and the amenities are old and feel dirty. The rooms need more light and the windows were very dirty.,Negative,,,,,
Only reason I stay there is because itâ€™s the only Hyattâ€¦ open more hyatts in Wisconsin and Michigan!,Positive,,,,,
Bartender was not behind bar very often. Was in bad where the food came out often.,Positive,,,,,
"Loved the extras that were there for the Packer game. The faceprinting, tailgate, and the breakfast burritos. The corn hole in the lobby was fantastic. Just the kind of extras I expect from Hyatt. It would be great if you would let your workers unionize though.",Positive,,,,,
This was the second time that I stayed so I was very happy to stay again!,Positive,,,,,
"It's disappointing to not have a complimentary breakfast AND have to pay for parking at the facility.  With ample spots in the parking lot, there is no need to charge customers a daily rate to park!",Negative,,,,,
Everything was above expectations.,Neutral,,,,,
Honestly would tell everyone donâ€™t stay there,Negative,,,,,
"I don't have a lot of experience with Hyatt branded hotels, but I must say I had higher expectations for a hotel carrying the Hyatt Regency name.  Every single person was lovely.  Many thanks to them.  And our room was spacious, clean, and comfortable.  But the hotel itself is quite dated and worn around the edges.  The room is quite dark, and the choice of using uniformly dark fabrics, finishes, and carpet only accentuates the scarcity of natural light.  The overall impression is that the building MUST have been an Embassy Suites in its prime, which must have been some time ago.",Positive,,,,,
We enjoyed theâ€gameâ€ experience of the hotel being packers fans and our first time visiting it was fun to see all that was done for game days. The shuttle was convenient for the game as well,Positive,,,,,
Give Anastasia a raise!!!,Neutral,,,,,
Alarm went off in room at 6am even though none was set. Parking was not great,Negative,,,,,
Staff was super friendly. It was awesome how they had the bags set up and did the breakfast burritos in the morning. Great pool area and water feature splash pad for kids. Definitely would stay here again. Hopefully they remodel the bathrooms sometime in the near future .,Positive,,,,,
"I get that around a packers game is going to be more expensive. But clean rooms are really a bare minimum. While the theme events in the lobby were great, having a room so sub par makes that meaningless.",Negative,,,,,
Breakfast in restaurant/bar was slow on 11/24. Server needed a showerâ€¦.,Positive,,,,,
"Appreciate the corner room upgrade and included goodies - nice surprise 

Older model - look at updating common areas",Positive,,,,,
"I did like the location, and the environment of the building. It has a beautiful aesthetic! I wish I had a better experience and could leave a positive review, but sadly this isnâ€™t the case.",Positive,,,,,
"The server in the lobby bar seemed new and maybe just needs some practice.  But when I order slices of lemon for my drink, they should NEVER be carried out in the palm of his hand without so much as a napkin.   Just lemons.  On his hand.  Which were then put on the wood table.   Yikes",Positive,,,,,
I have stayed many times. I liked the manager or staff person by the front desk that welcomed me and offered to help in any way even though it was busy. I liked getting a text when my room was ready. Hotel was very clean even though the rooms are dated.,Positive,,,,,
"The ticket to enter and leave the parking lot never worked and I had to buzz them to let me out every time and bring a new parking ticket to the front desk to have it validated every time as well. Diner told me at 11am that they were not serving lunch since they had so many breakfast orders. I decided to wait but when a second server asked me, he was confused and brought me a lunch menu. I believe the first server just didn't want to do it. Finally, my SUITE didn't have a dresser in it and I had to live out of my suitcase and mix dirty clothes with my clean clothes as I had nowhere to put anything. Was a very disappointing stay.",Positive,,,,,
"Email check in asked if housekeeping service was needed...i said no, but housekeeping came in anyway.  Seemed to be a waste of their valuable time when i didnt have needs on a 2 nught stay....",Negative,,,,,
Food quality and taste in restaurant did not meet my expectation. I had dinner in the restaurant my first night but was disappointed I had to leave the restaurant in inclement weather the second night to find better tasting food. Beverage service was good.,Positive,,,,,
all previous stays at hyatt have been satisfactory,Negative,,,,,
"Parking at the front entrance was full at arrival, requiring me to circle. Since it's attached to the convention center, I'm certain there is extensive additional parking but it was unclear what to do. Also, the ""validation"" of parking ticket just moved $10 from the exit to my bill. It did not help me, and I did not ask for that to happen. It complicates my expense report vs. just paying at exit. So, unless you're offering a discount, that's not helpful. Hotel feels like a full service convention center hotel. Very good vibe.",Positive,,,,,
Please stock Dewers Scotch.,Positive,,,,,
The hotel is going down hill.,Negative,,,,,
"Parking in your lot, should be for paying hotel guestsâ€¦.if no spots due to a conference, should get reimbursed.",Negative,,,,,
Common areas not cleanâ€¦ dirty carpets. Pub had excellent service!,Positive,,,,,
Loved it,Positive,,,,,
Contact me to discuss.,Negative,,,,,
I well advocate to all my friends and family that the Hyatt Green Bay is like a mid evil castle where the temp is the same regardless of the plebs wishes.,Positive,,,,,
"No soap bar at sink. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to use body wash from shower, so asked at the desk. They gave me a soap bar.",Positive,,,,,
More signage about how to navigate your skywalk to the elevators would be very helpful.,Negative,,,,,
We loved our spacious room!,Positive,,,,,
"Spider in the towels, otherwise great!",Positive,,,,,
"It would be nice if the parking fee was added when booking the room, or at least a box you had to check so that it's not unexpected when you get your bill.",Negative,,,,,
It would be easier to have an earlier check-in time,Positive,,,,,
Loved that they welcomed my little one to pick out a small toy!,Positive,,,,,
Room 712 the shower head was leaking and there was no bathroom fan. The tv in the livingroom was a good size but the tv in the bedroom was super small compared to last time we were there. The bed was comfortable and so was the couch.,Positive,,,,,
"Going cashless was a surprise.
We will have a hotel bar social scheduled for when we come back for our Knights of Columbus convention in May & having to use credit cards will cause a delay in serving members that will total possibly over 200 guests.",Positive,,,,,
"Great staff 
Easy check in process",Positive,,,,,
"We expected great service and accommodations at the Hyatt, and you most certainly came through!
All of our high expectations were met and thank you for the delightful stay.
The staff was incredibly kind and helpful.",Positive,,,,,
The hotel should work on a deep clean room by room .. all the corners and replace the old yellow light switches and plugs.  I would also begin to replace the AC units and have it actually cool.  The door handles and hinges are very old and could use a replacement.  It would not take much money to update each room to the next level and should be done for the price.  You should also have free coffee in the morning in the lobby.,Positive,,,,,
"Overall, the suites need refurbishing, but the bathrooms are in desperate need of handholds in tub, higher toilets, and overall renovation. The carpets in elevators are filthy and need replacing. Three people, one face towel and one hand towel, but three bath towels. Not what I expected from Hilton. Disappointed. No reason to contact me; I've told you what was wrong.FIX IT!",Negative,,,,,
Great hotel and will be back soon,Positive,,,,,
The pool and indoor splash pad were great! Also enjoyed the gym.,Positive,,,,,
"Your desk staff was amazing.  We called for an early check in and it was done smoothly and quickly.  We appreciated that.
Loved the warm pool!",Positive,,,,,
I missed the coffee maker,Negative,,,,,
"Rooms need to be updated, especially in the bathroom and the toilet areas!",Negative,,,,,
Would love a coffee maker in room!,Positive,,,,,
"Overall the food was very good, except for lunch on November 6 - everything else was so wonderful that stood out as not in line with your usual quality of service.",Positive,,,,,
Beds were stiff. room was hot. Could not adjust room temperature. Had to sleep with outside door open. Remote didnâ€™t work for one of the tvs,Negative,,,,,
My room was available upon check in and super clean.  Keep up the great hospitality!,Positive,,,,,
A little mold/mildew where tub met floor in bathroom and no coffee making ability in room,Negative,,,,,
I really like when there is a fan that can be put on at night to eliminate noise; especially the doors slamming. Those doors are very loud and hard to shut.,Negative,,,,,
"I clicked ""As Expected"" in almost every field, because I expected your staff would be excellent and they were! Well trained, knowledgeable, friendly, fast and responsive (I asked to borrow a broom for a team building activity. They did not blink, they just loaned me the broom and saved my presentation!) My room was clean and comfortable and well attended to. The one and only thing I wished for was a cup so I could make tea in the microwave. :-)",Positive,,,,,
Regular exterminator services would be helpful at this facility. The fruit flies in the Pub attacking my cocktail were off-putting.,Negative,,,,,
"I understand it was probably a cost saving issue, but it was frustrating not to have anything (mug) in the room to heat water in since there was no coffee pot. I was able to get warm water from the faucet but then there were no utensils to stir with.",Positive,,,,,
"They were updating coffee machines so our conference attendees were left without coffee in their rooms and at least twice the coffee pot in the lobby area was empty and I had to rush off to a session. So I wasnâ€™t able to get coffee. The food became chicken chicken chicken. The chicken was dry and even the sauce was dried on the plate when I received it at my table. I recommend if you must serve dry chicken just so many people. You also need to beef up the protein on your breakfast menu. 25 minutes to the end of breakfast there were no proteins left at one meal and they were never refilled. Not everybody can eat muffins bread, danish, fruit. Itâ€™s all sugar in the body.",Positive,,,,,
"The hotel itself was a great stay but the restaurant was less than desired.  We had breakfast with my family the next morning we checked in and the service was extremely slow.  Not only that they messed up my wife's eggs!  She asked for two poached eggs and they came out cold.  Then we asked to have it reheated for 30 seconds, which would have been fine but the gentlemen who reheated the eggs did it for 50 seconds instead so the poached eggs turned into scrambled eggs because they were over cooked.",Positive,,,,,
"The service was great. I'm sure you know the rooms are a bit outdated, which I realize is not an easy project to tackle. It would be great to have taller toilets, a fan in the bathroom, and more control on the temperature of the room. Again, I know this is part of a bigger update.",Positive,,,,,
Carpet needs replacing - it's all stretched out. Coffee maker would've been nice also.,Positive,,,,,
"I wasn't expecting the room to be as big as it was. Also, the bed was much more comfortable than I've experienced lately in other hotels.",Positive,,,,,
Spacious rooms and wonderful place to stay,Positive,,,,,
Restaurant was below expectations and service very slow.  Ate only first night because of first night,Negative,,,,,
We attended a conference.  The conference food was horrible.  Edible but not well cooked.  The first breakfast was not good except the fruit was fresh and very good.,Positive,,,,,
I indicated clean but there was some accumulated dust in vents and trim edges and corners.  An occasional deep clean would be good to ensure Hyatt level cleanliness.,Positive,,,,,
Cocktails at the bar varied GREATLY depending on the bartender. Nearly all my drinks tasted watered down; after two tries on two different evenings we went elsewhere.,Positive,,,,,
"Housekeeping was very friendly and knocked at our door, each day, to see if there was anything we needed.",Positive,,,,,
It would be nice to not have to pay for parking if you are staying at the resort. There was also not enough parking available,Positive,,,,,
"Have a coffee machine in each room if the coffee in the lobby is always going to be empty.  This was a work conference, and I expected there to be coffee at least somewhere. I went multiple times in the morning, afternoon, and evening and each time it was empty.",Positive,,,,,
The staff was very helpful and patient.,Negative,,,,,
We had one meal at the restaurant and asked for just a little pink in our burgers and they came to us completely raw with the outside barely cooked. It was quite disappointing. They did re-cook them once we asked and they tasted great then but I was pretty surprised to receive a raw burger.,Positive,,,,,
The rooms near the hotels could use additional soundproofing. I heard the elevator running constantly and it was disruptive to my sleep.,Negative,,,,,
Room was very warm and difficult to cool down due to the rain we had.  I have a number of allergies and than you for trying to cater to them.  The breakfast were not as good as I expected.,Positive,,,,,
"The thermostat should always work. My was set at 68 but it was 75 in my room. It was hot and uncomfortable. And there was no coffee pot, that is a must and it's listed as an amenity. I will not choose to stay there again.",Negative,,,,,
"For being a Hyatt property I was very disappointed in this property.  You had to pay for parking if you werenâ€™t an awards member, not even a coffee machine in the room!   No breakfast included, not even continental.  Hair dryer was so disgustingly dirty, Iâ€™m surprised it didnâ€™t die when I turned it on.  It could be a lovely property with some TLC but I wouldnâ€™t stay here again for the price!  With almost $200 for the room I expected better!",Negative,,,,,
"Itâ€™s just an inferior building. The atrium is fancier but the rooms are like an old Holiday Inn, or a motel. Most importantly, the beds were fine.",Positive,,,,,
The bear/restaurant was very understaffed. We waited over an hour and a half for breakfast. when served it was not even hot. Lousy way to start a day. Glad the Lions won.,Negative,,,,,
"toilets are too low
food at the KI conference center was less than desireable.",Positive,,,,,
"The rooms (or room I stayed in) was very tired. Carpet was gross and bunching from wear, couch wasnâ€™t all that great. Overall rooms need a refresh.",Negative,,,,,
Food service in the bar for the entire stay was understaffed and not able to handle the volume on a busy game-day weekend.,Negative,,,,,
The a/c didnâ€™t really work And we wondered if that was the loud noise we heard recycling all night. And the bathroom door was difficult to close completely.,Negative,,,,,
"Kolton provided excellent customer service. He was professional, kind and courteous.",Positive,,,,,
"Loved my stay here. Really awesome that you leaned into the game day experience. Appreciated the breakfast burrito and bloody mary bar, was well as the face painting. All the little games and the DJ were a cool touch as well. Staff was really nice. My room was comfortable. Everything was clean. Parking is super convenient. Only quibble would be the HVAC in the room. It didn't seem to be responsive. Other than that, incredible stay. Thank you so much.",Positive,,,,,
The food was not very good. I would hire a real chef make higher end food . The price of the  room and your name I anticipated a really grand hotel instead we got an extended stay . I have to day your staff made up for that . They were all great right down to check out so we thank you for that. We will come back,Positive,,,,,
It was a pleasant stay. I was a little disheartened that you did not offer Continental breakfast but I manage to eat at your restaurant.,Positive,,,,,
"In a room with a rollout, it would be nice of bedding was in the room. With no coffee maker in the we had to go to the lobby for coffee and that was consistently empty. Also, the rooms have the lowest grade of toilet paper, it really bad.",Positive,,,,,
None,Positive,,,,,
The value of the stay is not up to par. Fix you bar/restaurant service levels. Update the rooms if youâ€™re going to charge those rates.,Positive,,,,,
Bar seemed poorly managed,Negative,,,,,
Both days there was only one wash cloth.,Neutral,,,,,
Food service was understaffed. It took way too long to get food and drinks.,Negative,,,,,
Rated breakfast experience low because we ended up canceling our order because it took way too long and we were only in town a day to explore the city.,Positive,,,,,
"The toilet in the room was practically on the floor. The pub for breakfast was EXTREMELY slow, and only had about a dozen patrons. Had to ask multiple times, multiple staff for coffee and water. And the order was incorrect on top of that. The food tasted mediocre.",Negative,,,,,
The road noise from the outside was load and annoying.,Positive,,,,,
"Rooms are in need of upkeep. Siding and trim peeling away, getting very dated. Hotel bartender not the friendliest. Front desk staff very accommodating.",Negative,,,,,
Always enjoy our stays!,Positive,,,,,
This is a very nice property with a super nice and helpful staff. Everyone at our conference joked about how small the toilets in the rooms areâ€¦ might want to add that to the list of future upgrade projects. But overall this is a great place to stay!,Positive,,,,,
Excellent place to stay and have a conference at.  The beer at the bar was a bit too pricey at $6 a bottle.,Positive,,,,,
I was very disappointed there was not a coffee maker in the room.  The remote in the sitting area was an of replacement and didnâ€™t work well.,Positive,,,,,
"I was surprised to see a tip was charged to my bill for breakfast.  As a globalist I've been told that tip is included, but someone added it to the bill after I left.",Positive,,,,,
The staff was very nice. No complaints.,Positive,,,,,
"Hotel is in dire need of an update
No restaurant service. Had to go to the bar to place order.  Due to allergies requested no seasoning on wings. Sent it back twice and still an issue. I believe it was the same food rinsed and refried. Gave up snd  didnâ€™t eat.",Negative,,,,,
It was a very pleasant experience.  I am checking in again tomorrow night!,Positive,,,,,
"I received 2 keys when I checked in. When I returned to the hotel ((10/26/24), the day of my motherâ€™s funeral - my card did not work on the gate into the parking lot. So I pressed the buzzer at the gate and it went up. I then proceeded to my room on the 7th floor. Neither of my keys worked. I returned to the front desk, explained my situation and your employee, â€œNikoâ€, responded nonchalantly, sorry, this happens from time to time. The 2nd issue happened when I asked to extend my stay an extra day and checkout on 10/28/24. Melody extended my checkout time on 10/27/24 until noon. Meanwhile, she was going to to look for another ADA room for me because the room I was in, 701 had been booked. While  I was in my room packing ALL my things, I received a call from the front desk indicating they had found an ADA room for me. I was grateful and asked if I if I would be staying in the same room. I was told â€œnoâ€. I then proceeded to the front desk to meet the noon checkout time. I met with Melody at the desk and asked what my â€œnewâ€ room number was?  She told me I would be staying in the same room I had just checked out of. I was grateful yet frustrated.",Positive,,,,,
Staff nice and responsive. Second stay using GOH and was charged breakfast both times. Was not offered upgrade at check in.,Positive,,,,,
Beautiful building!,Positive,,,,,
I was disappointed to have to pay for parking and that there's no continental breakfast.,Negative,,,,,
You need more help at the bat on a Saturday night.,Neutral,,,,,
"I paid for a corner king suite, and was put in the middle.  The toilet was so short, and I'm 5'1"", that it felt like I had to sit on the floor.   The decor is very dated, 25 years or so.  The bed & pillows were so uncomfortable.",Positive,,,,,
Hotel is in dire straits,Negative,,,,,
"The hotel was 'tired' and worn. I understand there's a renovation coming in the future, but I was still disappointed in the 'shape' the property, especially my room, was in. This is not the typical Hyatt experience I've come accustomed to over the years.",Negative,,,,,
"Needed to use the pull out and it was trash. Prob need to get this out of the room, just put a little damper on the one night stay otherwise definitely like the 2 room separation",Negative,,,,,
"Great job by staff. Hotel condition, needs improvement",Positive,,,,,
Breakfast was service was incredibly slow. Even getting our bill and then payment processing took at least 20 min.,Positive,,,,,
"Coffee process needs improvement. Thermos for self serve, poor execution. Runs out often. Many people left the line due to the slow service.",Negative,,,,,
Let your later evening checking guy go.  Ruined us ever coming back.,Positive,,,,,
We are repeat customers which is why some of my answers were...as expected.  We trust Hyatt and will be returning.,Positive,,,,,
"As I say in all of my reviews for Hyatt, theyâ€™re the best thatâ€™s why I choose them. I donâ€™t stay anywhere else when I travel unless of course thereâ€™s not a Hyatt where I travel to Quality and I always get good quality when I stay at Hyatt.",Positive,,,,,
All staff members were outstanding.   Recommend housekeeping stay with one elevator bay and leave the other bay for guests,Positive,,,,,
They are understaffed. They need to be more attenuative to their globalist members.,Positive,,,,,
"One thing they did right as they had a breakfast taco bar set up on game day, which was quick and easy that was A Plus",Positive,,,,,
We had registered 3 people and only had linens for 2,Positive,,,,,
See above.,Positive,,,,,
Nice hotel friendly staff,Positive,,,,,
"I was part of a group that was staying at the hotel. My room and parking were supposed to be covered with our group. The person who checked me in put a hold on my credit card for the full amount, not just incidentals. Also, I was sent an invoice for parking that was subsequently reversed because it was covered by our group. When I asked about these issues, they were addressed immediately to the extent possible.",Positive,,,,,
The pool.is amazing and everything was working great. It would be amazing if they had TV with apps where we can access our own content. Room service in the future would bring this hotel to the next level. The staff should greet guests when they walk in a simple hi goes a long way. Overall a great place to stay.,Positive,,,,,
"There was an issue with the reader at the entry and departure.  We were not told when we checked in to use our room key to enter and depart the property.  So, we used our credit card (that never worked), so we hit the â€˜issueâ€™ button (I donâ€™t recall exactly what it was called).  On our 2nd night, we tried to use a card that we never use and overnight there were fraud charges on that card.  Coincidence? I think not.  We told the supervisor Samantha and she had her team check something, but this should be a warning to others.",Negative,,,,,
"Breakfast at the restaurant was extremely disappointing. Menu was over-priced, service was poor. Considering much less expensive hotels offer free breakfast and parking, we were disappointed that we had to pay extra for both at a higher price.",Negative,,,,,
The location with respect to the stadium was perfectâ€¦not too close and close enough to be convenient and quick!  We had a great time!,Positive,,,,,
"I hate the scented lobby. It's obnoxious, gets in my clothes and makes it impossible to enjoy the public space. I had to wear a mask going to and from my room. This will keep me from choosing a Hyatt hotel in the future.",Negative,,,,,
"the staff were great. I forgot to let them know about a feather free room, & they took care of it right away",Positive,,,,,
"The only thing that was inconvenient, is that my room was on the 8th floor, having more convenient vending machines without having to travel to the market would be beneficial. I woke up thirsty later at night and had to travel to the lobby just to get a bottle of water.",Positive,,,,,
"Great facility, loved the suites!",Positive,,,,,
Great property overall really enjoyed our stay.,Positive,,,,,
"I love my 2 waters a day as a status member, but there was no water for purchase at the front desk :(",Positive,,,,,
The washroom is little bit small.,Neutral,,,,,
"Elevators were extremely slow, my first room smelled like weed and I had to ask for another room.",Negative,,,,,
"Breakfast at the restaurant is too much food and too costly. Breakfast items at the hotel market are too limited, and when items ran out they were not replaced for several days.",Negative,,,,,
"We were there in a corner room for 2 nights. I expected to have glass glasses and real coffee cups. Not what I expected to have plastic and paper. 

I was concerned regarding the condition of the interior of the room with drywall flaking and the water spots.",Negative,,,,,
Great room!,Positive,,,,,
"Leaving the parking lot the gates didnâ€™t work correctly.  Stuck for over 0
20 min just trying to get home after a conference left a bad taste in my mouth",Positive,,,,,
Great stay and staff.,Positive,,,,,

"Customer service was great. Accommodated request to change to another floor and room. Prefer high floor and close to the elevator. 
Offered all benefits of Discoverist level.",Positive,,,,,
NEEDS AN UPGRADE|||,Positive,,,,,
The breakfast options at the hotel were extremely limited and the parking lot in front of the hotel was full at 11PM . we had to wait for someone to leave to secure a spot. On the plus side I found the exercise room to be well equiped.,Positive,,,,,
"The rooms need an upgrade, there should be more charging ports or outlets in the bedroom. 

The pool area was a nice surprise and pulled the rating up.

The breakfast bar / cafe area didnâ€™t have the best barista. We found her to be cold. She also showed up 10 min late and didnâ€™t apologize while we were waiting for her to open.",Positive,,,,,
This was one of the dirtiest hotels that I've stayed at in a long time.  The common areas especially outside of the rooms were absolutely disgusting and looked like they had never been cleaned.,Negative,,,,,
Room for Improvement: The shower took a long time (5 minutes or more) to warm up and the temperature could be hotter.,Positive,,,,,
Pleasant stay with very friendly and helpful staff.  Thank you!,Positive,,,,,

We did have some cobwebs in our room with a complimentary spider.  I would have welcomed an extra blanket in the room to use while watching tv and I did think breakfast was included in our stay but I must have read that wrong.,Positive,,,,,
Restaurant food unacceptable ordered an appetizer combo out of cheese curds. Ended up giving us chicken tenders and french fries french fries are OK but the tenders were terrible overly breaded breaded and dry.

Why did you clean and empty room before check out time????",Positive,,,,,
"Not enough food on the buffet lines. Carpet in room 312 has holes in the carpet and the carpet is rolled up in areas. Had to ask twice for a no housekeeping sign for my door. The fire alarm detector is installed to close to the vent outside the bathroom, this will cause the fire detector not to respond quickly. Ask your fire marshal if this is correct.",Negative,,,,,

Have stayed here many times before for business - service is always great, staff have always been attentive during our business lunches and breakouts.  Thanks for a great stay AGAIN.",Positive,,,,,
"There was just a small mix up.  We checked in to our room and then our key didnâ€™t work so we had to the front desk.  Our reservation was mixed up with another person with the same last name.  If was fixed quickly, just a small inconvenience.  Front desk was very helpful and courteous.",Positive,,,,,
Our stay was fine. Nothing to really complain about.  The hotel is very tired and dated. Not up to typical â€œHyattâ€ standards in my opinion. It felt more like a best western . No toilettries in bathroom. No glasses for drinking. Balcony was so full of cobwebs we couldnâ€™t sit on it . Overall we had a nice weekend but probably wouldnâ€™t stay here again.,Positive,,,,,
"Have stayed here before for conferences and it is a nice place. Personally, I donâ€™t think weâ€™d afford it for personal but we enjoyed it. Very clean!",Positive,,,,,

"The past two times that I have stayed for LeadingAge conference, I have been billed breakfast. It doesn't show on the my checkout sheet, but then appears on my credit card. Very disappointing since I didn't eat anything except what was sponsored. This time I even questioned it at check-out and staff assured me there would be no charges.",Positive,,,,,
"I love the Hyatt, but dislike the parking fee",Negative,,,,,
"When a guest calls and leaves a message, one should expect a call back.",Positive,,,,,
There was confusion about the bus stop for game day. This was something that drew us to your hotel. We did our own investigation to find the right stop. The person at the front desk was unsure and directed us to a wrong place.,Negative,,,,,
Our housekeeper appeared under the influence,Negative,,,,,
I understand that there was some kind of computer glitch but I thought it was handled very secretively and very poorly.,Negative,,,,,
Found it insulting to have to pay for parking in your lot after paying ridiculous rates for a blocked group of rooms for a wedding party just because  of the possibility of a Packers game.,Positive,,,,,
Good service. The area lacks restaurants etc,Positive,,,,,
It was some of best customer service that I have seen in a long time. I would also like to thank the housekeeping. Most hotels do not have daily housekeeping. It was a treat.,Positive,,,,,
STAFF WERE WONDERFUL,Positive,,,,,
Check in was great!,Positive,,,,,
A pleasure all around I was sorry to have to move over to a Aloft when the Hyatt had no vacancy for my fifth night couldnâ€™t hold a candle to your place,Positive,,,,,
The parking lot is horrible. I left for 3 hours and when I returned there were no parking spaces I had to park in the city ramp,Negative,,,,,
"The staff is exceptional. So friendly and helpful. 
This is my second stay in a row that the parking lot gates wonâ€™t open with a room key and we have to hit a button and wait for someone to let us out.  When the desk clerk is busy, they donâ€™t answer so you have to go back inside and request to be â€œlet outâ€. This is incredibly inconvenient, frustrating and considering that it seems to have been happening for over a month, frankly ridiculous.  Coupled with the things we noticed that desperately need to be addressed, itâ€™s concerning. I worry what conditions will be like when I plan to return next month.",Negative,,,,,
"Enjoyed our stay, were told the rooms will be remodeled which they do need, but our stay was pleasant.",Positive,,,,,
Rip off,Negative,,,,,
All your ridiculous add on prices is why Iâ€™ll never be back. First hotel I ever stayed where thereâ€™s $5 for some old ass coffee sitting in a thermos. Yet KCups in our room are free.,Negative,,,,,

Great stay. Big thank you!,Positive,,,,,
I love that Iâ€™m always greeted every time I come into the hotel by friendly staff.,Positive,,,,,
Restrooms by ballroom under the stairs need to have the doors adjusted as the latch would not close on half the stalls.,Negative,,,,,
Samantha was very helpful. The housekeeping staff was all extremely friendly and helpful. Wonderful stay!,Positive,,,,,

There was one tiny thing, and weâ€™ve noticed this in past tripsâ€¦.the street the hotel is on seems to become a drag race line until lateâ€¦it would be helpful to have some sort of way to abate the noise in the rooms. But overall we loved our stay!!!",Positive,,,,,
Bathrooms and carpeting could use updates. Carpet did not lie flat on the ground and was bunched in spots. Furniture could use some TLC.,Negative,,,,,
Lovely room. Very comfortable bed. The only problem was not the Hyatt's fault. A car alarm was set off around 4 a.m. and kept on beeping for about 30 minutes.,Positive,,,,,
"The sofa bed mattresses were rock hard. Not the best for the person stuck out in the sofa bed area of the suite. Even though they might not be used much, please consider the comfort of those who might have to use them.",Positive,,,,,
"There was a delay in the check in process and a line had grown for a significant amount of people and time.  I felt that the front desk staff would have addressed this situation a little more by calling up additional help or handling it in a better fashion to speed up the process more.
Also there was a mild situation with teenagers entering the hotel as we witnessed that should not have belonged.  They drank beverages in the cafe area (water and coffee) and I believe took food items that were not paid for.  The front desk person saw this happening and nothing was done about the situation.  By us seeing this happen by being in the front lobby area at the time I felt a little unsafe as to what was going on?  Thankfully they left and nothing more had happened.
As for the conference I was part of... the first day they had ran out of breakfast items before 1/2 of our group was able to eat.  More food was brought out but not communicated to the group and it was wasted to not be able to have.  I was disappointed as I was one of the individuals that didn't get to have the majority of what originally was served.  I think that could have been communicated better to the group.",Positive,,,,,
Hyatt sets a high standard so â€œmeets expectationsâ€ is a reflection that Hyatt outperforms the competition.,Negative,,,,,
"Being from the Appleton area, I was not expecting to have to pay a parking charge as a guest. I wasn't surprised by the gated lot w but to have to pay as a guest, for this area, seemed like a money grab (and I don't recall seeing that listed as a separate fee anywhere on my reservation). I was looking for a late night meal around 10:30PM and was disappointed to see the kitchen was already closed although the bar remained open (everything in walking distance was closed as well though). The pool area greatly exceeded expectations. Staff was friendly and helpful the few times I called ahead of check-in as well as during check-in.",Positive,,,,,
Things are just kind of old there.  Like the ceilings in the bathrooms seem to be moldy and you can just tell are old.  A little dusty but not terrible.  Did like how big lights in the bedroom werenâ€™t able to turn on/off with the light switch,Negative,,,,,
The toilet rattled when sitting on it. It gave me an uneasy feeling that I'd fall off it.,Negative,,,,,
As older guests we did not feel as secure taking a shower.,Positive,,,,,
Bartender was rude and did not handle a situation appropriately.,Negative,,,,,
Layout of the room was excellent.  Hotel wasnâ€™t very full and they put us in a top level room with a balcony.  Very cool,Positive,,,,,
"Anastasia, who worked the front desk, provided the highest level of customer service. She was courteous, professional, and prompt.",Positive,,,,,
"There is some fraying at the edges.  Lobby/atrium lamp shades need to be replaced - they are threadbear and look old.  Just little things like that throughout the hotel.  However, it is still a great hotel and everything works.",Positive,,,,,
"Obviously the hotel was an Embassy Suites and I loved that chain. The lobby carpet is very dizzying though. Some things in the rooms need an update: the large mirror on the dresser, the couches, there were patch and paint marks on the walls that could be done better. The most puzzling thing though is that the lotion dispenser in the bathroom has a metal bracket that has 2 screws that go into a wooden panel that has 4 screws going into the wall. It looks like an afterthought and looks cheap. Not on brand at all. Also, the coffee makers, while functional, are very cheap and not on brand for what I expect out of a Hyatt.",Positive,,,,,
they oput me in an upgraded room on the 7th floor. But it did smell a bit of smoke and the some of the furniture was pretty beat up. Overall everything was clean though.,Positive,,,,,
I had a room on the highway side.  Besides the doors all facing the atrium (which is noisy in and of itself) to be on the side with the road had me experiencing noise from both sides of the room. It was distracting.,Negative,,,,,
The corner room had no desk????,Neutral,,,,,
"$25 per person for breakfast buffet is ridiculous.  Bar has gnats flying around. Other than that, it was a good experience.",Positive,,,,,
Pool area wasnâ€™t quite what we expected.  Puddles you had to walk through.  Not a clean as we expected.,Positive,,,,,
The place is in need of some serious updating. The hotel is tired and does not warrant the Hyatt name.,Negative,,,,,

Hotel is located in an excellent location. The hotel staff was very helpful whenever you ask questions. The restaurant bar food was excellent and the staff very friendly. It would have been nicer if the full breakfast had lower price.,Positive,,,,,
I liked the refillable shampoo and conditioner and shower gel bottles. This way I donâ€™t have to throw away a partially empty bottle. I do wish you had bigger towels though.,Positive,,,,,
The restaurant service was horrific. The staff was more interested in talking to each other than waiting on me and my party. We had to get our own coffee refill some people had to clean a table so they had a place to sit.,Positive,,,,,
Top notch team and they all care very much about what they do and showcasing the hotel in the best light. We have this on our list for a return event for sure,Positive,,,,,

A separate charge for breakfast??? That is expected to be included these days.  Bar should be open later.,Positive,,,,,
"I went in for coffee from the little shop and that was a long wait with only one person working the area and a large group in house. I also went to the restaurant one night around 8:30 pm and there was a manager working the bar and finally additional staff came in to help. It was tough to get drinks and food in a timely manner and no one came to check on us so we were planning on ordering dessert and when someone finally came after we got our food, we found out the kitchen had been closed for 4 minutes and they would not take the order. I couldn't find anything on the menu or sheets that indicated a ""last call"" option for food ordering.",Positive,,,,,
hotel was overpriced compared to the other hotels we stay at in Green Bay in the area,Negative,,,,,
Our stay was very good. Only problem was that we got a king instead of 2 Queens. Very small children size toilet. I understand they were to be renovated.,Negative,,,,,

This place was fantastic!. More than exceeded my expectations for the stay.,Positive,,,,,

"The restaurant was expensive, slow, and only offered limited options.  The coffee was almost undrinkable.  First breakfast took over 45 minutes.   A LONG initial wait to order followed by food, (but no bevereages), which was incomplete, requiring the server's attention for a THIRD time. Breakfast should NOT be that hard.  The host (seater) had noticeable body odor.",Negative,,,,,
"You need towel bars in the bathrooms.  You also need to start replacing your toilets with the tall toilets.  People with knee, hip and back problems have a hard time using low toilets, especially when there is no grab bar to use to assist them.  
The food and drink prices were quite high. Hand out maps of your facility might have been helpful.",Positive,,,,,

"Housekeeping did a good job. Always asking questions if we needed anything or would like anything done. Facility looked pretty worn out.

Drip coffee should be free. There should be an.optional free breakfast - nothing fancy - but something. The breakfast was way to expensive.,Positive,,,,,
Donâ€™t like the cashless policy.  It cost me extra money to use the washer and dryer because of the system you have. If you are going to be cashless have a card reader on the machine so you can pay the exact amount.,Positive,,,,,

"Toilets in room were baby toilets.   Shorter than a regular seat, hard on the knees.  Should upgrade to a taller toilet.  I heard a lot of folks that were there last weekend complaining of the shorty toilets and knee pain.",Negative,,,,,
Sad that a group as big as EWMA staying at you Hotel had to buy 5$ coffee when a 50 dollar a night hotel will feed you breakfast and free coffee 24 hours a day. The Pub was terrible twice we tried to eat dinner and once we tried to eat breakfast no tables were clean. Others said they waited hour for coffee.,Positive,,,,,
"Amazing, kind, considerate staff and wonderful facility. Great hotel.",Positive,,,,,
Very pleasant. We will be back.,Positive,,,,,
The PUB was out of a couple of the items on the menu and the service was slow.,Negative,,,,,
Breakfast I ordered was never delivered accurately. Never did get my sausage links.,Positive,,,,,

"The front desk was really nice at check in and we loved how big the room was. I also think a printed TV guide would be helpful, as I couldn't easily find channels I like.",Positive,,,,,
Curtains in the room had ripped out hems causing extra fabric to sit on the floor. It n my case that is a tripping hazard. Iâ€™m handicapped.,Negative,,,,,
"Although the property is showing signs of itâ€™s age, we were impressed by the size of the room and cleanliness.",Positive,,,,,
"The whole atrium area and Restaurant Bar was a disappointment with a complete lack of vision. The rooms are dated and in need of refurbishment, and what's with the bad coffee.  The stuff that emanates from your plastic push button pots is just wrong ... on every level. This hotel has good bones but lacks just about every amenity that defines a Hyatt Regency.  

You can start by offering a decent cup of coffee and breakfast selections. Don't get me started with the night time menu. (Get a real Chef) This whole space is just a dead zone.  Start by knocking down the restaurant wall and let the dining area flow out into the atrium. On the other hand, the back part of the atrium with its endless tables ""needs"" separation.

Image a central marbled walkway to take you to the elevators with a large fountain in the center that provides white noise for this cavernous space. To the left is a casual sitting area where I can enjoy my cup of coffee.  To the right is the open, yet private ""French Street Scene"" dining area giving way to inside tables and finally the bar. The other half of the atrium area is a now a totally separated space, you enter from the back with booths, open tables & private nooks ... this is not an area where kids run freely.  Perhaps an additional bar with limited food is open during busy times ... this same food available for Room Service! 

IMO the Atrium, not just the rooms, will define this Hyatt.  

Green Bay's premier downtown Hotel and fine dining venue.",Positive,,,,,
Staff was respinsive when I said toiket was broken.,Positive,,,,,
It was very inconvenient to go downstairs and for us to move because of dogs! I think Hyatt should change its policy of animals in rooms and a hotel meant for PEOPLE!Animals make mistakes and are dirty!,Negative,,,,,
The staff was extremely accommodating despite there being a large presence of an NFL team occupying the entirety of the hotel save for our room.,Positive,,,,,
"When we walked in, we thought the hotel was just beautiful and we took pictures. We were in awe. Our room when we walked in was also quite beautiful and had a comfortable feeling to it. However... the mattress is very high off the ground and when you lay on the mattress your body sinks into the mattress. Like contours to it. We both found this extremely uncomfortable and especially when you sleep with somebody...trying to move or turn over was almost impossible. I ended up moving to the other bed because I found it impossible to sleep comfortably with my husband on our anniversary trip. Secondly, the door is quite difficult to close with slamming the door. We felt bad because we believed this was probably a huge inconvenience to our neighboring guests. Third, the toilet seat is unbelievably low to the ground. Made going to the bathroom quite uncomfortable and getting on or off the commode was quite a challenge. I can't imagine how difficult it is for tall people if it was that complicated for us shorter folks. The location is great. The pool looked wonderful and the bar was a delight. We loved the extra large TV in our room. But the beds and the toilet we absolutely dud not like to the point where we did not enjoy our stay. Unless the mattresses get changed and higher toilets get put in, we will not be back.",Positive,,,,,
"Compared to some earlier stays, this one was very nice and I appreciate the effort and improvement!",Positive,,,,,
"There was a problem with my reservation. I reserved a king standard room and was
confirmed and when I arrived no inventory. Only 2 queen suite available. No discount offered when asked.",Positive,,,,,
"I don't like plastic cups, but the bar had some",Positive,,,,,
Kicking people out of the lobby at 11pm was not nice. Might want to change that.,Positive,,,,,
"Love location & staff; rooms could use some upgrades, staining on floor & curtains",Positive,,,,,
It would be nice if the toilets were oblong vs round.,Positive,,,,,
"Only feedback I could offer is to possibly have a jump pack battery starter available at the desk. I ended up needing to jump start the motorcycle I had trailered, the battery had got drained somehow.
 I checked at the desk they weren't able to locate one so I end up purchasing one. For around $120 it's pretty useful and I'm sure I'm not the only guest who has experienced a dead battery after parking their vehicle. Other than that great Hotel we will definitely book again.

"Listened to the elevator all night, even though my room was nowhere near the elevator.",Neutral,,,,,
"Food quality needs to be a lot better. Hamburgers served were very well done like eating a hockey puck. Corn on the cob was extremely overcooked and mushy. Several of the vegetables on the veggie tray were brown, soft and bad mostly the celery and tomatoes. At Breakfast the bacon was again extremely overcooked and just crumbled. Feel like I was over charged for some eggs, cold potatoes and overcooked bacon and some pastries. Other than the quality of the food program everything else was good. Also charging $10 a night for parking is ridiculous when most of the time there was no room to park so I had to park across the street and pay in the parking ramp as well.",Positive,,,,,
"The only negative about the stay was the breakfast.  It's always been good.  Years past there was sometime making omelets and a variety.  This time scrambled eggs, sausage and potatoes were the only option and were just not good when I was there.",Positive,,,,,
"Add new carpet and air purification system to hvac, as well as clean hvac vents, they dirty.",Positive,,,,,
This hotel felt very rundown. I would not stay again unless it was updated.,Negative,,,,,

You had my information in your system about prior issues I have had with rooms on a certain side of the hotel. I really appreciated that,Positive,,,,,
The $10 per night parking fee was not disclosed in advance.,Positive,,,,,
There was not enough parking,Negative,,,,,
Just was given a key to a room that was already occupied. They said it was a computer glitch.,Negative,,,,,
I'm only 5' 7 but I still felt like the commode was too low. Probably felt it more due to sciatic issues,Positive,,,,,
"I did note some significant wear and tear in some of the corners and edges of the room. The trim piece under the bar was coming off and I noted some things were scratch and dent in the ""corners"". No shade, just observation",Neutral,,,,,
Kind of rundown.,Positive,,,,,
"Location is very good.  Some room and lobby furnishings are dated, but hotel is clean and staff are very responsive.  The food menus are limited inside the hotel.  Parking is easy and local dining is available in a short distance.  Price is reasonable.",Positive,,,,,
My room needs deep cleaning room 221. Dust was visible behind tv and on counter tops. Sofa was dirty.,Positive,,,,,
"I appreciate the lighted magnifying mirror in the bathroom. However, I did not like the shampoo products and also, the bathroom was lacking the proper number of towel bars and hooks to accommodate 2 people. There was no place to hang 2 towels to dry. The bedding was very comfortable, but an extra blanket would have been nice. I thought the room felt dark and a big depressing. Brighter lighting and accessories would be appreciated.",Positive,,,,,
Our stay was comfortable. The shuttle to the airport early Sunday morning was most welcome.,Positive,,,,,
"Impressed with the toiletries--organic is great.  Chef accommodated my no salt menu for breakfast and dinner.  The food prepared was simple, but very good. Rooms very specious, including kitchen and foyer geared toward comfort of the Guest.  Great location. Walkable distance to restaurants, river etc. Great little store on the property. Looking forward to coming back next year.",Positive,,,,,
Still the slowest elevators around - haha,Negative,,,,,
Buffet service and food were fair at breakfast. Dinner was ok. Brisket was excellent.,Positive,,,,,

"The elevator is extremely slow which is my only real complaint with the hotel. When I checked in, the computers were down but this is not the fault of the staff. They helped me the best they could given the circumstances.",Negative,,,,,
Always a good stay in Green Bay ðŸ‘ðŸ¾,Positive,,,,,
Pricing is atrocious in the cafe area and the Pub333 is always short staffed. Food takes 45 minutes to an hour and a half even during quiet times. Staff needs training.,Positive,,,,,
"The elevators were slow or barely working during our stay. Otherwise, it was a splendid stay! Thank you for making it great!",Positive,,,,,
"With the NFL draft coming up, I hope the housekeeping issues can get worked out.  The reception was responsive, the restaurant and breakfast were great, but the housekeeping team and laundry were severely lacking. I even had a laundry guy arguing with me about extra towels when 2 out of 3 days the pool did not have any towels for those who were swimming.  Also there were some issues that were non-consistent with the parking cards- part of our party had to validate every time and the other part had something done to their key card so they didn't have to validate.  In addition, as a family with young children, there was no white milk offered in the 24 hour store. Lots of adult beverages, chocolate and even strawberry milk.  A steady milk supply and some uncrustables would've been a great addition.",Positive,,,,,
The only two suggestions I would make for the Green Bay Hyatt regency are: 1. The toilet in our room was small and uncomfortably close to the ground - I have never found a toilet this small and uncomfortable before. 2. The elevator doors in the beautiful glass elevators need a paint job or at least a paint touch up as they stand out in the midst of a lovely Hyatt.,Positive,,,,,
"The hotel remains our preferred venue in Green Bay: between the excellent staff, clean and well laid out suites and location, it is hard to beat!

That said, the rooms are showing their age. Beds are less comfortable (springs are starting to be felt), the bathroom fittings are starting to come away from the walls, the fans are getting more noisy, the fridges are more temperamental...

An overhaul will be needed soon if you want to continue to demand top dollar.",Positive,,,,,

"When there are signs at the pool forbidding guests from leaving into the hallway without drying, there should be extra steps in place to assure fresh towels are in good supply. I asked a front desk attendant about this and was told that there was to be at least a 30 min wait for new towels.

It was â€œFamily Dayâ€ at Lambeau Field, so I understand that things get overrunâ€¦..but during the 2 x 1 hour periods I was in the pool area, a hotel rep never appeared.  Towels were an issue, but also drunken parents bringing glass bottles into the pool area had gone unnoticed.",Positive,,,,,

I used the messaging option in the app to contact the hotel and let them know I would be checking in the next morning but it seems that message got missed and my reservation was canceled. Iâ€™m sure the room cancellation is part of policy but maybe before doing that cancellation part a quick check of messages should be done to see if the guest reached out. If my room was no longer available because someone didnâ€™t see my message and gave the room away I wouldâ€™ve been pretty mad.,Positive,,,,,
"We have stayed here a few times.  Kids like the pool area so that is why we stay there.  The rooms are fine.  There is always some minor damage somewhere  in the room.  Wood trim coming off, fridge wobbling in the cabinet.  AC wasn't very cool. Overall I feel it is over priced for what you get.  Late 4PM check in, 11 AM check out. It's just okay in my opinion.  Just being honest.",Positive,,,,,
A refund for my stolen property would be great!,Negative,,,,,
"In my opinion, the balcony should have a screen so that it can be left open. I couldnâ€™t leave the balcony door open because bugs might fly in.",Positive,,,,,
Need to do a better job of planning. Do not book reservations if you will not have rooms available. Getting back to the hotel after 11pm and finding out our room still wasn't ready was extremely disappointing.,Positive,,,,,
Check in process needs sorted,Neutral,,,,,
"I would say that the front desk clerk and night staff were awesome.  Great customer service.  It was a bit of a long check in because the computer systems were down.  However, the staff was awesome and great in spite of that.",Positive,,,,,
Pool area was great. Hotel has a cool layout but rooms are very much in need of refreshing,Positive,,,,,
"Hotel was clean, but dated and worn areas. Lots of cobwebs on balcony and in hotel areas.",Positive,,,,,
"The staff at the hotel were great. Very friendly and helpful. The rooms are a little ""tired"" and could use an update. The toilet is very small and low to the ground making it uncomfortable. Only complaint was the elevators were slow and one was out of order for the last couple of days of our stay.",Negative,,,,,
This hotel needs some serious deep cleaning or renovations.,Negative,,,,,
"Our reservation was clear there were three of us (2 adults, 1 child) with a room with a single king bed and a pull out couch.  However, the pull out couch was provided no pillows and there were only 2 washcloths in the bathroom.  We called for additional pillows, but this hotel is not particularly family friendly.  Perhaps it is not meant to be as it is attached to a convention center.  Our stay was adequate but certainly not exceptional.",Positive,,,,,
Recommend non slip tubs. Place the little grips in bathtub so the elderly or others do not fall plus no handles in bathtub for the elderly,Neutral,,,,,
"When we came back late in the day, there was no parking and the front desk just rattled off directions to a parking ramp like it was obvious. A small map would have been nice.  Not enough towels for number of occupants even though it's specified when booking. And unless I just didn't look enough, nothing to make up the pullout. A lot of opportunities for improvement, but not a terrible stay. We did not call and ask for anything bc it was nearly 11 at night.",Positive,,,,,
Restaurant staff was short in the evenings.,Neutral,,,,,
"It was late afternoon and we decided to stop at the bar for a few cocktails.  It was shift change so I understand some confusion may happen.  The new bartender walked past us multiple times with out even acknowledging that we were there.  I finally said ""when you have a free minute"".  He stopped stared at me and said ""do you need something NOW or can I take care of the other customers"".  The other customers already had a drink and were waiting for a refill.  I assured him we would wait.  While we waited the bartender kept brushing his hair away from his eyes. My wife wanted to leave at that point.
we finally received the drinks and then the bartender kept complaining about the Hyatt's credit card only policy and they don't understand bartenders depend on cash tips. 
The bartender continued to complain how he's working three jobs and going to school at the same time. 
In summation I enjoyed the hotel but I will never be revisiting the bar.",Positive,,,,,
"I will continue to stay at the Hyatt, when my business calls for it, but I have to say, that I feel that your prices at the bar are simply outrageous. You will not see me there again.",Negative,,,,,
The hotel looked a little dated.,Neutral,,,,,
So thankful for your kind and welcoming staff!,Positive,,,,,
"We had a great stay. Pre arrival texting with Breton was very good! She answered all our questions quickly and helpfully! Staff were great. Hotel able
to accommodate our small Dog. Weâ€™ll be back! Thank you hyatt team!!",Positive,,,,,
I loved the ability to check in online. My flight got in late but I was able to check in online via the email you sent to me. This was a great and surprising feature.,Positive,,,,,
This place should have been remodeled and updated 10 years ago.,Neutral,,,,,
Staff always does an amazing job!,Positive,,,,,
"Frustrated that the staff did not do more to stop all of the kids that there from running around knocking on doors, yelling and tying up use of the elevator. Would havre been much more appropriate for staff to speak to parents.",Negative,,,,,
"It is too bad that the hotel is located in an area where there is no nice view of the city. Too, I had hoped that it would be located closer to a downtown shopping district.",Negative,,,,,
"The only issue I had was when the wedding was done everyone moved to the lobby.  With that being a open area, there was alot of noise that could be heard in the room.  Very loud and not able to sleep.  Maybe allow guests to use banquet room until everyone is gone or some how limit noise of guests.  That is my only complaint.  Thank you",Positive,,,,,
SOUND ISSUE WAS A BIG ONE BUT CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE PERSON RESPONDED TO ME ON THIS. THE ISSUE OF GIVING A FUTURE DISCOVERIST A BREAKFAST CARD AND THEN REMOVING IT WAS NOT WELL RECEIVED. BUT THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE PERSON APOLOGISED FOR THIS ALSO,Positive,,,,,
See above,Negative,,,,,
Mice in lobby during check in. Desk staff noticed but played it off like they didn't see anything...,Positive,,,,,
My only issue was the lack of a full-length mirror in the room. I was getting ready for a wedding and that made it challenging.,Positive,,,,,
"Elevator was not working. Ice machine on my floor was not working. The kids splash pad was really neat, but the water smelled.

When I first checked in, the staff had to manually enter information to know what to charge me for taxes because ""I came in through Hotels.com"" which confused me and made me feel a bit weird.",Positive,,,,,
"My Experience at your hotel was so bad that I feel compelled to write and complain. I noted on my booking that that I would be both late check-in and that I required a quiet room. This was due to my travel from the middle east where I was severely jet lagged. When I arrived, I was told that all rooms were gone and all that was available was a very noisy room on the road side. Take it or leave it. I asked to see the manager. I was greeted by a very poorly dressed and slovenly manger called Kolton, who eventually emerged from the back room. Big scowl on his face like I had woken him up or disturbed what he was doing. It scares me to speculate what. The first thing that my wife and I noticed was that his pants were open. We tried to ignore this but I felt so revulsed by the sight of this very poorly dressed and dishevelled manager that was representing your brand that I had to say something. He zipped up without even turning his back. Full frontal and no apology.  I explained the noise issue and he offer complementary breakfast. Little help to have no sleep and free breakfast. He then said he would cancel the booking and I could go look for somewhere else to stay. Really! At almost 12 midnight. He then told me it would be very noisy in the room but he could give me a fan for white noise. Still not acceptable. In the end I was exhausted after a 16 h flight and the whole day at the trade show and 4 hours of driving to Green Bay. So, I just went to the room. I slept on the couch between the bedroom and the hall in order not to hear the road noise. I Slept fours then got up and worked due to the noise. Finally, to make things even worse. As I left the front desk and reluctantly accepted the terrible room, your manager had the gall to say. â€˜Enjoy the rest of your evening.â€™ My response was some strong common English phraseology. In the morning I didnâ€™t waste time speaking to the manager as I had to get to Oshkosh so I just left not intending to use Hyatt again. As It happens, I have used Hyatt again this week but I will not ever go back to Green Bay nor recommend anyone else does.",Negative,,,,,
I stayed there b/c I wanted to feel good service and cleanliness instead of being in an AirBnB. that didn't happen.,Positive,,,,,
I reserved the room online through Hyatt website.  No where did it say I would have to pay$10 parking or $50 incidental charge (refundable upon checkout with no issues).  I simply applied all taxes and fees it came out $276 approx but upon checking was charged $336.  Very nice hotel very nice employees but your website needs to be transparent all ALL fees!!!!!  I observed another guest in front of me with same complaints.,Negative,,,,,
Requested early check in when made the reservation months in advance. Called early the day of arrival to request early check in (we had an event at 4 pm) were told to call back later - called back 2 more times and was given the run around and never got early checkin. Found out had 2 weddings going on that day that seemed to be the priority.,Positive,,,,,
This used to be a beautiful hotel back when it was an Embassy Suites.  The lobby and courtyard are now very generic and boring.  Definitely won't be staying here again.,Negative,,,,,
"One of the worst experiences Iâ€™ve ever had at a hotel. Clear lack of management and training. The check in process was awful. Had to wait an hour after check because our room wasnâ€™t ready which put us late to our plans for the rest of the evening. 3 different associates working the front desk and all of them dropped the ball in a different way regarding our check in. We were told to leave our belongings in a different room and they would be moved to our room when it was ready. We returned from our outing and our items were not moved. The front desk staff acted clueless even though he was there for the whole debacle. By the time we got got settled it was probably 10 pm and we realized there was only 3 towels for a 4 person stay. We called the front desk and were told the towels were in the dryer and it took another 45 minutes to an hour to get an additional towel. Guests were partying in the lobby and it was extremely loud at our room. The security guy that helped move our bags said they would ask people to be quiet at 9:00â€¦that was 9:30. The worst hotel experience Iâ€™ve had, ever.",Negative,,,,,
I was told if I wasnâ€™t already a member I could have gotten my $10 parking waived but nice I was already one I had to payâ€¦ parking was a pain to find a spot,Positive,,,,,
There were a big group of kids/adults staying for what appeared to be a baseball event - the kids were completely unruly - running & screaming all over the lobby/pool/halls & riding the elevators up & down for fun & totally unsupervised by the adults - kinda ruined the atmosphere,Negative,,,,,
"The staff were in general not that helpful, we purchased food one morning from the coffee shop and it was moldy. The hotel in general was old and dirty - carpet needs to be replaced in rooms, better lighting, new water fixtures, the whole place felt dusty and dirty to be honest.",Positive,,,,,
Need to have a childrenâ€™s menu and cups with straws for the kidâ€™s breakfast.,Positive,,,,,
Was not worth what we paid for,Negative,,,,,
tissue box would be welcome in room,Positive,,,,,
The elevators are very slow and there is no easy access to stairs,Positive,,,,,
"Hotel needs updating. 
Scarlet employees were not up to speed on handling Hyatt points associated with a reservation.",Positive,,,,,
The pool and hot tub were very gross.,Negative,,,,,
"Entire hotel tired and worn. Doesn't deserve to be labeled a Hyatt Regency. Gross and depressing colors. Rooms depressing. Wall textures, and design are dated and hotel needs to be destroyed and rebuilt from scratch. Food service at breakfast so slow we had to leave after waiting 30 mins for food. Food tasted bad.",Negative,,,,,
Was unaware a convention was going on and my daughter was scared of the people at the convention because they were not dressed normally,Negative,,,,,
Place does need a makeover.,Positive,,,,,
"Discoverist level, but only got the water when we checked in. No offer of an upgrade. Staff were very nice.",Positive,,,,,
Toilets are very old and low and should be updated,Positive,,,,,
This hotel is in dire need of refurbishment. It is harming the Hyatt brand. Everything is worn out.,Negative,,,,,
Check In and out was efficient.,Positive,,,,,
We were charged for parking when we did not park at the hotel. They charged us parking for a parking lot that could hold MAYBE 100 cars at a fully booked hotel.,Positive,,,,,
I've stayed at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay twice now for work and both experiences have been very pleasant. I found the staff to be incredibly accommodating and friendly upon check in and check out. The rooms were well maintained and overall facility was well kept.,Positive,,,,,
We ate at Pub 33 and had the breakfast buffet. The breakfast buffet was okay. Pub 33 was terrible. Our waitress lost our drink ticket and then lost our to go order ticket. It took forever to even speak with her and she didn't stop in to check with us so we never got straws or refills. The food was subpar and expensive. We probably won't choose to eat there next year.,Negative,,,,,
Rooms and bathrooms need updated.,Neutral,,,,,
"WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE PLACES TO HANG TOWELS.
I DON'T MIND KEEPING THE SAME TOWEL FOR 3 DAYS BUT WHEN THERE ARE 4 ADULTS IN THE ROOM AND ONLY ONE HOOK IT IS A COMPLAINT",Negative,,,,,
"The staff was working very hard, but it was clear that the number of staff was not what was needed. I was also disappointed about the lack of complimentary breakfast as I've stayed at much smaller hotels that proved this much appreciated feature.",Positive,,,,,
Very disappointed that there was no window in my room. No dresser.,Negative,,,,,
I'd definitely like to keep booking the same type of room going forward,Positive,,,,,
"Please provide wheelchairs for people to use if need be. My partner had a medical emergency, but no where was selling wheelchairs. We called to ask if we could use one from the hotel, but apparently the Hotel and Con Center only have one wheelchair. Having multiple for people to use if need be would be extremely helpful.",Positive,,,,,
Would like full refund,Positive,,,,,
Staff was very nice. Hotel desperately needs renovation.,Positive,,,,,
Staff us always kind and helpful,Positive,,,,,
"The overall hotel experience was wonderful - huge rooms, fairly clean - a bit dusty, but staff was responsive when the toilet clogged.",Positive,,,,,
Pub 333 closed too early for breakfast (10 am),Positive,,,,,
"The rooms need to be renovated    Most importantly, the rooms are DARK - they need more light.   Mattresses are ready to be replaced too.  The staff did an excellent job.  Just infrastructure issues.",Positive,,,,,
"How to exit the parking lot was explained poorly, resulting in me becoming very frustrated and having to park the car and return to the front desk to find out what and where to scan to get my car out.",Negative,,,,,
"I canâ€™t stand cashless places and until you restore cash as an option especially at the restaurant and bar I will not return.  Cash is my method of payment for breakfast or dinner or beverages and my choice of tipping, Cashless places I will not be back, a shame as very nice hotel",Positive,,,,,
"The restaurant was overpriced for what you got and staff was OK. Food taste was below average. For this place to be a Hyatt ""Regency"" level, it sure did not even come close to any other Hyatt properties I have stayed in. Rooms were very dark and dingy with poor lighting. Bathrooms very tiny for room size. Toilet heights were appropriate for children. Approach to the front entrance of the hotel left much to be desired due to the parking lot being lacking landscaping.",Positive,,,,,
"I was in room 612.  Nice room.  However there was a noise (from above?) I could hear nearly constantly, perhaps mechanical? Sounded like noise I've heard pipes at a cabin make when shower is running - but this was almost all of the time.  Very disruptive.",Positive,,,,,
This was the worst stay at Hyatt ever.  This has never happened before.,Negative,,,,,
not having complementary coffee not acceptable,Positive,,,,,
"Breakfast is great, lunch/dinner in the 333 pub was less great in terms of prices/selections",Positive,,,,,
I hope to return in the future,Positive,,,,,
The room was so dark. Updates needed.,Negative,,,,,
"Favorite hotel room I've ever stayed in, not sure I can go back to a ""normal"" hotel again after staying here.",Positive,,,,,
Samantha who checked us in was very helpful and engaging person,Positive,,,,,
"Front desk staff, especially Samantha, were so cheerful and kind.  Thank you!",Positive,,,,,
Seems pointless to offer digital check-in when your digital key won't let you in and out of parking.,Negative,,,,,
I so appreciate having daily housekeeping!!  Front desk staff were uniformly pleasant and helpful.,Positive,,,,,
Cleaning could be better. Green mold on tile grout in the pool area. Bathrooms by pools were not cleaned during my stay. Our room had a balcony and it was covered with spider webs.,Positive,,,,,
"The pool was unavailable without warning.  No one at the front desk could tell us the status of the pool.  We requested a late check out since we couldnâ€™t use the pool and we were charged $50 to check out at 4 pm.  The front desk staff was not helpful as at other Hyatts, saying it was difficult for them to know what was going on as well.  Thatâ€™s really not the response I expect from Hyatt staff.  Their response should be to make the guest feel comfortable and not defensive.  I always have my visitors stay at the Hyatt in Green Bay and I was disappointed at their stay.",Negative,,,,,
"Rooms were not ready. We understood the problem, however, we waited two hours in the lobby with other customers. Other customers were giving their rooms when they became available. New clients also received their rooms. We got our room finally after confronting the front desk.",Positive,,,,,
We were disappointed in the meals.,Negative,,,,,
"We had a wonderful stay and will definitely be back! Our only complaint was no parking spots available the night of July 4th. Tons of people (not guests) decided to park in the lot as it was close to the fireworks, but it left no spots for actual paying guests to park. There should be some way to ensure itâ€™s only guests parking, since we are paying for parking in addition to the room when we stay.",Positive,,,,,
Parking was an issue8,Neutral,,,,,
Great,Positive,,,,,
"The stay at the hotel was great, food was exceptional. The only thing that truly frustrated me and quite disappointing was the parking arrangements for the hotel. We stayed during the 4th of July for the National Brown Swiss convention. The convention activities had us at the Brown county fairgrounds until 8:30-9:00 at night. Little did we know that when we returned to the hotel, we would not have parking . I feel the hotel parking should only be allowed for guests. Visitors/public were parking anywhere and if there had been an emergency, there was no fire lane or space for emergency vehicles to even enter. I had to stay up much later than I wanted just to move my vehicle and I still had to be directed across the street to a separate parking ramp. Signs that state violators will be towed should not even be posted as cars were still blocking the parking lot in the morning. If this is a normal occurrence, visitors to the hotel should be told up front where to park should there be no parking. Those parking illegally should actually be towed for the safety of everyone.",Negative,,,,,
"The staff was very friendly. The pool area was well maintained and the best part of the hotel.

I canâ€™t stress enough how terrible it was to find bloody sheets on the bed.

Additionally, every other hotel of similar quality that I have stayed at throughout the country offers a complimentary hot breakfast. The breakfast at the hotel was overpriced.",Negative,,,,,
"There was multiple issues with the parking and room cards not working to scan in/out of the lot. The Pub restaurant for breakfast was insanely expensive.  There should be a small continental breakfast for the price or better options.
The pool was very clean and enjoyable. The kids had fun. The room was clean. However, compared to other hotels, the TVs and remote systems are significantly outdated.  Beds and lighting were good.  Room setup and overall hotel design was great.",Positive,,,,,
"Prices for coffee and snacks based on quality, is not reasonable. Restaurant was service and food was fine.",Positive,,,,,
The hotel overall seems rather shabby.,Negative,,,,,
I will not stay here again because of  the condition and uncleanness of the room.,Negative,,,,,
One of my rooms was not ready at check-in. I waited an hour,Positive,,,,,
It was great that you had fireworks ! Haha.,Positive,,,,,
"1. I was there for a convention and baskets were left in the conference which was either locked or had someone by the door and items were stolen out of baskets 
2. There was not enough parking spots. I could not park in a spot even though I was paying for the parking.",Negative,,,,,
The parking was kinda a mess on 4th of july,Negative,,,,,
One request would be to offer free regular coffee in the morning during a short time period. Anything extra should be available for a price.,Positive,,,,,
Noisy traffic on Main Street side,Negative,,,,,
Need more hooks in the bathroom. Replace carpeting. Itâ€™s so oily,Neutral,,,,,
The staff at the front counter need better training and they need to be better aware of the policies and how things work. They need to be more attentive to their customers needs and concerns. They need to answer the phone.,Negative,,,,,
Only issue was finding a parking spot in hotel parking the evening of 4th of July. There was none - it was FULL. Stayed at hotel July 3-6. It was a shock to come back after being gone for the day to find no parking.,Negative,,,,,
"The day of my checkout I explained everything to the lady at the front desk, who was very helpful.   I explained everything to her, and she said there was no charge of any food on my room, but that she still would not charge me due to the gentleman not being at the front desk.    She was very pleasant, professional, and genuinely care about doing her job properly and making sure that I was happy.",Positive,,,,,
You should have free coffee like most hotels. And you shouldn't charge hotel guests for parking.,Positive,,,,,
I really think you need to upgrade your toilets. They are so low to the ground. As you get older itâ€™s hard to get off of a toilet that is so very low.,Negative,,,,,
Your elevator situation is in dire need of help. They are crazy slow and no access to stairs to bypass them. Not only are they crazy slow but tiny. We heard a lot of complaints and they really make us not want to stay here again.,Negative,,,,,
Rooms are starting to show their age.  I stay at a lot of hotels and free coffee in the morning is offered at every one.  Your hotel did not.  I stayed with you for many years on the 4th of July.  Your lack of simple inexpensive amenities for the excessive cost of your rooms is driving me away.  Do a little market research and find out what your neighboring motels offer.  You are falling behind and I will be finding an alternative next year.,Negative,,,,,
"Front desk voice was so loud everyone could hear it in the cafeteria my guest that was staying with me heard everything how embarrassing! 
The room literally had vacuums lines, dust and the shower curtain was broken it really made me wonder if my sheets were clean or if there was bed bugs 
Prices were way over marked $4.00 for a water? 16 for a burger?",Positive,,,,,
We enjoyed our stay and the facility was lovely. Water pressure in our shower was rather poor but other than that we had a great stay.,Positive,,,,,
Please see my previous comments.,Positive,,,,,
"There should be vending machines on each floor, I wanted to buy a soda but no machine on my floor. I went to the lobby and there was no self checkout so I had to wait in the checkout line to pay. Thankfully someone called me up and charged it to my room.",Negative,,,,,
The motel and the staff were absolutely amazing! They made our experience in Green Bay over the top.,Positive,,,,,
Samantha was very friendly and apologetic for our experience. She asked me to send her photos that we took of the dirty room. She said she was going to reply with some sort of compensation but we havenâ€™t heard back.,Positive,,,,,
I was dissatisfied with the cafe and pub 333. Cafe had gnats in the store that were a real turn off.  Pub 333 was under staffed based on the number of guests registered at the hotel.,Negative,,,,,
The room layout with a â€œliving roomâ€ at the entrance then the bedroom was exceptional,Positive,,,,,
"I was worried about getting into the elevator as several times I pushed the ground button from the 6th floor and it bounced a little and then refused to move so I got back out. Another time I got in and the people in it said let's hope this works, we pressed down and ended up going back up again despite the ground floor being selected. It was the first elevator on the pool side. I have stayed here so many times for conferences and left with the feeling that the hotel was getting old. I did appreciate that I could do a late check out due to a conference call. The bedroom part of my room was great and felt updated and clean.",Positive,,,,,
Did not like elevator expierence,Positive,,,,,
"The hotel rooms are outdated. The rooms are spacious, but need to be remodeled to be lighter and brighter. The mattress was very comfortable! The elevators also looked dated and sounded a bit rickety. I wish there had been more flexibility to cancel once I knew I wasn't staying a second night. Location is great and ease of getting to the hotel from northern Wisconsin was terrific. Parking lot also needs some attention and a refresh...looks a bit run down. Hotel breakfast service was fast and the food was good.",Positive,,,,,
"While the decor was a bit dated, overall the facility was just what we needed. The only issue in our room was the carpeting-there was a rather large hump of extra material on the floor. We had a very long wait at the restaurant Saturday morning, and service was mediocre because there was only one server working. Our group alone had 16 people-and one family group left to eat elsewhere.",Positive,,,,,
Had issues where clerk did not post cash to my account. Had run around for that,Positive,,,,,
Needs renovation. Excellent customer service.,Positive,,,,,
Complimentary coffee should be offered in the lobby.,Positive,,,,,
The bed sheet had dried blood stains on it.,Negative,,,,,
There werenâ€™t many guests the night we stayed - would have been nice to have a room with a view rather than the wall of the building next door. $10 for parking when the parking lot was empty seemed a little extra.,Positive,,,,,
"Great rate, good location.  Rooms will need renovation.  Suggest check whether all lights working.  Elevators slow, but we made do!",Positive,,,,,
My only issue beside the toilet was there were no wash cloths we had to make a special request for them but they came immediately which was great.,Positive,,,,,
"Rooms are dark and outdated. Dirty carpets. Atrium and lobby was very nice , wish the rooms were updated. Fabric on couches were dirty.",Negative,,,,,
"Also charged $10 for parking through hotel and another $12 at gate. 

I have stayed here for years and love so much about the hotel.  I hope you can get this back to the classy hotel this it has been for years.",Positive,,,,,
The restaurant closed too early given that there werenâ€™t any other restaurants within walking distance.,Positive,,,,,
You ask about the hotel but then follow up about the people.  The people are great.  The physical space is old. It's not connected well to the conference space.  Why doesn't the skyway connect from the hotel stairs directly to the conference space.  Why doesn't the conference space have a skyway to the parking garage.  Why doesn't the hotel and conference have a better riverwalk. The catered food in the hall for the conference was not good. The catered lunch was decent.,Positive,,,,,
The final bill could me more clear. Not sure why it costs $222.00. When it first said the final bill would be $180.00,Neutral,,,,,
"The rooms were quite loud. While I know the style of the hotel does not help with noise, it was even louder than expected.",Negative,,,,,
Terrible lunch service in the bar and restaurant.  Front desk was terrific.,Negative,,,,,
"This hotel really needs an overhaul - good bed, desk, but room and hotel look shabby.",Positive,,,,,
Parking was terrible - if the lot is full - have a colored stop sign or some other method available.,Negative,,,,,
Impossible to figure out your TV stations without a channel guide. Elevators are SLOW!,Negative,,,,,
Check out was horrible.  I am tax exempt and the tax was not taken off and the person did not know how to do things.  After waiting for 30 minutes we finally had to leave and someone contacted me to straighten everything out.  Every other part of the stay was wonderful.  It was very frustrating as my father in law was critically ill and I wanted to get home and what should have taken 2 minutes ended up costing me over 30 and still having to be contacted by the hotel later to fix it. I checked out at 6 am but to me all staff should know how to do checkouts correctly.,Positive,,,,,
"You donâ€™t need to contact me, but you may.",Positive,,,,,
"Restaurant service took soo long and despite just a few customers service wad slowing owing to the fact that there was only 1 waiter, who was trying his best. No more chicken items available.",Positive,,,,,
Hotel needs an upgrade.  Been staying here for years.,Neutral,,,,,
"I just donâ€™t like how the hotel sits in relation to the convention center, and that there wasnâ€™t enough parking. Also the hotel is quite old and it shows in some ways despite the remodeling. The elevator is extremely slow, the curtains in my room were a little broken, the couch felt dirty.",Negative,,,,,
The hotel needs a remodel. The app needs a response quicker. Not enough towels were left in the room for a room that was suppose to accommodate 6.,Negative,,,,,
"Overall, staff was very pleasant.",Positive,,,,,
I LOVED THE 2 ROOMS!!!,Positive,,,,,
"Part of the curtain and blinds were shredded, which didn't impact blocking the light but was very surprising it wasn't replaced. Overall condition of the room was dated, with paint and bathroom condition showing need for a refresh.",Positive,,,,,
It was an abomination.,Negative,,,,,
"The stay was lovely, however the rooms need a bit of TLC - some updates and paint might be helpful.",Positive,,,,,
Very dated and worn. Staff was excellent though.,Positive,,,,,
"Samantha was amazing. The gentleman, not so much. Really disappointed you did not have toothpaste or contact lens solution for purchase. Decor is a bit tired.",Positive,,,,,
Coffee in room and at restaurant not good and slow service,Positive,,,,,
Love it there but it has become too expensive. No free parking or breakfast also adds to the overall cost.,Positive,,,,,
"Until 4pm no one helped me. They told me at the end the room I requested was out of service. They put me in a different room. Bed was so curved, I slept on the sofa. Then when I  called next day, they said, the room I wanted was occupied by someone. How come if the room was out of service and the room was assigned to different guest? I want my money back. I am asking three nights free stay with full managerial hospitality.",Positive,,,,,
Bathroom was too small. I couldnâ€™t use the shower because the bathtub was too slick,Positive,,,,,
I was overcharged also my patio door wouldn't lock and I jave a 3 year old,Neutral,,,,,
You've earned our continued business.,Positive,,,,,
"We experienced a special situation and the staff is very attentive and gave us great service more than we expected, which is always excellent from Hyatt",Positive,,,,,
Elevators are too slow. Too much waiting for an elevator.  One didnâ€™t ride smoothly.,Positive,,,,,
Great!,Positive,,,,,
"The hotel food options are awful. The restaurant had no kids menu, bare options. The grab n go said it would take 20 min for a bagel so we left.",Negative,,,,,
Hotel is dated needs an update. Itâ€™s an average hotel that doesnâ€™t stand out in any areas.,Positive,,,,,
"Hotel needs to be renovated! Cheap bathroom door, bathroom too small, no hooks anywhere to hang towels, robes, etc.",Negative,,,,,
Its always a pleasure working with Samantha at the front desk - she is always very positive and I love her attitude,Positive,,,,,
Very friendly staff and very clean hotel!,Positive,,,,,
"The parking arm about drove me crazy.  The staff was very accommodating, however.  The restaurant was slow.  Free breakfast would be super.  It would be nice to have a kitchen rag.  Sheets came out from being tucked under mattress.  Even though there was a card on the door, related to entering, service still entered.",Positive,,,,,
Your restaurant and staff need improvement,Positive,,,,,
The clerk in the evening and in the mornings were very helpful to adjust the reservations given circumstances had changed with need for modification.  Great follow through and very polite and competent response!,Positive,,,,,
"Beds are inconveniently high off the ground.  I'm 4'11"" and felt I should have had a step stool to get in bed.  Room decoration is so awfully dark and dreary.",Negative,,,,,
"The staff and service was fine.  Having coming for four successive years now, it seems as though ""corporate"" has not invested in many improvements, at least as far as I can tell.",Positive,,,,,
"We found  the food to be substandard for a Hyatt Regency. One example was an order of eggs benedict  that came out of the kitchen with nacho cheese sauce. Another example was breakfast potatoes prepared with hot sauce which one of our party was allergic to.
Thankfully, you have wonderful counter staff and an exceptional server named Alicia who tried very hard to make things better.",Positive,,,,,
"The hamburger lunch was not very good - tough meet.  Our dinner banquet was very good - beef sirloin tips, garlic mashed potatoes...  Also ate in the restaurant.  Did not like the bison burger too spicy.",Positive,,,,,
"the shower curtain seemed odd... a single, thin layer of fabric that was outside the tub on arrival. I expected there to be a plastic liner that would stay in the tub... there wasn't so I put the thin cloth in the tub. Worked perfectly fine... just seemed odd.",Positive,,,,,
"I was really surprise to find that there weren't any handicap accessible bars around the bathtub.  I wasn't the only person.  Another gentleman that was at the Conference had made mention to that as well. 
When I went through college, I did jobs as a maintenance person.  My boss at the time was a stickler on dust around base boards and beds.  He always told us, the crew, it only takes an extra minute or two to take the broom and sweep around the base boards and the beds or other furniture to create a better sense of looking clean. You don't see the grayness around those mentioned areas.  Otherwise, everything looked good. I'm sorry if that sounded picky. I do now look for that even around the church that I service. Yes, I even do this in my own home.  
I'd like to thank the front desk personnel in getting my bill straightened out. 
Thanks and God Bless.  I would stay at this hotel again in the future.
Blessings.",Positive,,,,,
"I enjoyed my stay aside from the fact that there is an additional price for parking. I think it is ridiculous the amount I spent just on being able to park at the hotel. If it werenâ€™t for that, I would definitely recommend staying there. Iâ€™ve been debating staying there again in 2 weeks, but am hesitating to pay an additional $40 just to park..",Positive,,,,,
Carpet in our room was terrible and the whole room needed a complete update.,Negative,,,,,
"Room was very cold. Told staff and I received 2 blankets, heater and 2 chocolates. Regarding the meals, average. The regular coffee was very weak, decaf was not hot. Complained and had to go to coffee shop to get coffee. That was extra money on top of the money already put out fir meals. Glad to be going back to Marriott!",Positive,,,,,
My only recommendation is that a hotel as nice as this would be to splurge on a better quality toilet paper.,Positive,,,,,
As we are older we really want grab bars in the shower/tub.  It was a disappointment to not have those safety features.  We did enjoy the pool. It was nice and warm.  We also used the hot tub which was nice.,Positive,,,,,
My family are happy that our room was upgraded. We really appreciate it. Thank you and God bless you more!,Positive,,,,,
"In particular,  the pool,  sauna, and steam room were outstanding amenities.  The fact that there were extended hours for this was very much appreciated. The only thing wrong was the restaurant inside of the Regency. The breakfast service was poor and the food was inedible. We cannot recommend this restaurant but the room, staff, and pool area was exceptional.",Positive,,,,,
"My emailed receipt won't print correctly.  I get the basic form with no data.  I can see the data if I open the attachment, ir just won't print.",Positive,,,,,
"Lots of jumping spiders around the window & curtain area. Ice machine was broken, otherwise everything else was perfect. The beds were very comfy. Thank you.",Positive,,,,,
Hotel staff is great.  The rooms are tired.,Negative,,,,,
"Breakfast should be included. High price mid week stay not associated with a conference, should have included a breakfast credit.",Positive,,,,,
Appreciate the early check in. Enjoyed the computers and ability to print.,Positive,,,,,
"This hotel is very beat up and rough.  Suite rooms are very well sized, but furniture is nicked and dated and public areas are also quite beat up.",Positive,,,,,
Stay was great. Only issue was we were told we couldnâ€™t get room service because one person was working,Positive,,,,,
"Big screen tv is great!  We were charged for early departure, but one phone call resolved the issue to my complete satisfaction.  Great customer service.",Positive,,,,,
"As I noted before,  the hotel is very run down and very outdated.",Positive,,,,,
The only way we were given any acknowledgement of our Anniversary was after we complained   Not so much as a kind word or discount card until they knew how disappointed we were. We thought we were going to an upscale hotel but we have had better experiences at a normal cheaper hotel.,Positive,,,,,
Upon checking out I received my statement but once I got home there was a discrepancy on my bank account.,Negative,,,,,
"Bathroom was very clean, shower was very clean but the shower certain smelled terribly of mildew.",Negative,,,,,
It really was a great stay.  PLEASE change the sofa bed in room 728.,Positive,,,,,
My husband left a bag in the room by accident and the staff was extremely helpful getting it back to us!,Positive,,,,,
Tried to clean my room at 5:30 pm while I was getting ready for dinner.,Positive,,,,,
The rooms are very dark and need a refresh. I had a good stay but would not stay at this hotel again due to room decor.,Positive,,,,,
"During my reservation I was prompted to confirm that I would not receive housekeeping, but then was given it every day of my stay. I wish I had known so I could put my things away better.",Positive,,,,,
The room was quite noisy through the night due to mechanical sounds...,Negative,,,,,
I will definitely book Hyatt Regency for our Convention in 2025.,Positive,,,,,
Friendly staff!,Positive,,,,,
front desk and the coffee area on main level were awesome!!!,Positive,,,,,
I had no idea what was happening with Breakfast.  I thought it was free but I didn't see any kind of breakfast available to eat.,Positive,,,,,
Rooms could use some updating.  Trim and doors very worn along with floor and tile in the bathroom,Negative,,,,,
My favorite place to stay in Green Bay.,Positive,,,,,
"Staff was great but the hotel is well past its prime and is tired looking.  Paint in the elevators, new carpet, better lights in the room would go a long way.",Positive,,,,,
This Hyatt REALLY NEEDS an update.,Positive,,,,,
I couldnâ€™t comment on the food as we didnâ€™t eat there but the kitchenette in our room was awesome. We had picked up dinner on our way to the hotel and ate at our little bar in our room. We loved it!,Positive,,,,,
"Your staff was great your pool was great your facilities are very nicely cleaned and presentable. Your restaurant was terribly overpriced, so we just did not eat there, not a big deal but when I have to sleep in a sauna not acceptable.",Positive,,,,,
The bakery items were very dry and bland. Fruit was fresh and juicy. Our yogurt wasnâ€™t kept in anything cold (ice bucket) and it turned into milk within the hour. Mimosas were as expected and delicious. The staff and coordinators were very friendly and helpful. Wish there were more elevators as itâ€™s a hike to get to one place to another. I will consider this place if Iâ€™m ever in Green Bay again.,Positive,,,,,
"Some of the cabinets were a little chipped and beat up. Also, the makeup mirror provided was great to have! However, it was so squeaky and old. Otherwise, it was a perfect stay. We heard great things about the 333 restaurant, and I wish I was able to try it!",Positive,,,,,
Front desk was AWESOME,Positive,,,,,
"The food in the restaurant needs improvement. The burger was poor quality and the fries over salted, not worth $14. 

Although the rooms were clean, I noticed that the furniture was scuffed up and carpet needed to be replaced. 

What's up with no fitted sheet on the bed?",Positive,,,,,
Not a big deal but I was needing tissues (Kleenex) but there wasn't any.,Positive,,,,,
I wished there was free made coffee in the hotel in the morning.,Positive,,,,,
"The coffee cafe cashier was so very pleasant, helpful and cheerful",Positive,,,,,
I have stayed at your hotel many times and am usually satisfied with the rooms and cleanliness but the way all the staff including the manager the next day dismissed the fear and anxiety we all had at the child being stuck in the elevator that high up was very upsetting.,Positive,,,,,
"2 major problems #1 The Pub 333 was horrible, I had breakfast the 1st day Pancakes were not cooked lunch my order was not as ordered  my breakfast 3rd day again not cooked as ordered will not eat there again #2 charged for parking and had no car refunded 4 days had to call and get 2 addtl removed. Unfortunately I will be back in July for another meeting that was pre-booked otherwise I would have opted for the Hampton next door. I shouldn't hava had to ask 3 times to correct my bill and as far as the restaurant how do you screw up Buffalo chicken tenders with Blue cheese and you receive fried tenders plain with BBQ sauce?",Positive,,,,,
Checkout had parking charged on my invoice when I didnâ€™t drive a vehicle. This happened to other members of my conference with the same situation. The clerk at checkout couldnâ€™t make the correction until a manager arrived at 6:30am. They had to email me the corrected receipt.,Negative,,,,,
"The check in person was very helpful , but getting a manager to help was a lot more painful. Finally a manager emerged and I told her she canâ€™t run away we needed some help. She did immediately come over and assisted the very nice and helpful desk person. She was able to resolve my issue.! It was a simple change to extend my stay a day and the computer was not cooperating. That should be a click of a button and took 10 minutes!! I think the software needs an update!! Make things easier for your staff!",Positive,,,,,
We will not stay at this establishment if in the Green Bay Area again.,Negative,,,,,
This is one of our favorite hotels!,Positive,,,,,
Great location.,Positive,,,,,
Every staff member we spoke with was extremely helpful and friendly.,Positive,,,,,
Wonâ€™t be coming back,Positive,,,,,
Checkout email mentioned complimentary breakfast. THEY DON'T HAVE.,Positive,,,,,
We really enjoyed our stay and the room setup was great! It would be amazing if the rooms could get updated though.,Positive,,,,,
Your facility needs a complete renovation. Old carpets and fixtures. Tattered furniture in and out of the rooms.,Positive,,,,,
"One of the kids in our group was stuck in the elevator, and it took staff 10 minutes to even respond. Them when the manager was confronted. She just said she was short staffed. It was not ideal at all.",Negative,,,,,
"The elevator availability was disaster and walking up the stairs from floor 2 to 3 was scary. No Kleenex in the room. Ordered a breakfast take-out for an order of avocado toast with a side of bacon. The restaurant was very short-staffed. I didn't receive the bacon but was charged for it. When I went back to the restaurant to let them know, I stood there forever but finally had to leave. Paid for no bacon. I paid to stay at the hotel and then was charged $10 to park my car. I've never had to do that at any other hotel. It was a very disappointing stay.",Negative,,,,,
Plenty of toilet paper in room. Bed and shower were wonderful. Availability of luggage carts ...somewhat undependable. Pub served food as quickly as possible.,Negative,,,,,
I didn't think the banquet meal was very good,Positive,,,,,
I would recommend allowing temperature control in the rooms. This is my 3rd stay in the past few months and the rooms are HOT! Nothing happens when trying to turn down the thermostat,Positive,,,,,
It would be nice to have ice machines.,Positive,,,,,
"Amenities and workout space are very nice. The staff were helpful, accommodating, and solicitous. Rooms are a bit dated",Positive,,,,,
Loved the room size. Toilet seemed small (height wise) A little outdated but served our purpose. Elevators were slow but that could have been from the amount of people all trying to use them at the same time. Liked that the pool was open til midnight.,Negative,,,,,
"Hotel was great for how busy it was. It was really understaffed for food and beverage, coffee area, and restaurant.",Positive,,,,,
"Everything is great, but the elevators are extremely extremely slow",Positive,,,,,
I did not complain while on stay because my 15 year old is a germaphobe. Had she heard me talk about the room she would not have stayed and would have slept in the car which I did not want.,Negative,,,,,
The majority of folks that were staying overnight during our stay were teenage dancing group members with their mothers. Lack of adult supervision made waiting for elevators very lengthy and I had a late checkin was tired and not feeling great. And overhead the security agent saying the elevators were being overrun by the large group at 10 pm .,Negative,,,,,
The elevators broke twice. Front desk was NOT overly friendly. He was definitely overwhelmed and should have had back up on a full weekend.,Negative,,,,,
"The market has gone down hill since last time we stayed. Coffee, salad and sandwich was not worth the money or convenience. We were so excited for the salads we loved last year and not so much this year.",Positive,,,,,
"This would have been a solid 10 across the board, except for the elevators. They are slow, there are clearly not enough of them, and there should 100% be a service only elevator. That poor cleaning staff must waste hours of their lives waiting for those elevators. I spent far too much time waiting for the elevator myself this weekend. I have stayed at this hotel several times a year for close to 20 years. This has always been an issue but is insane during conventions.",Positive,,,,,
Read the above comment call me if you want,Positive,,,,,
"Room was a bit unmaintained.  everything was working fine but it's run down.  Restaurant had alot of plates left sitting on tables, people were leaving for no service.  Overall the place was a bit run down and staff were overwhelmed.",Neutral,,,,,
Front desk staff at check out and check in were friendly and efficient.  Great job.,Positive,,,,,
We enjoyed our stay and it was very nice to be able to walk to the conference center.,Positive,,,,,
Over flow parking was not explained and was charged for parking until I told employees that I would not pay for something that I was not using.,Positive,,,,,
Never staying here again.,Positive,,,,,
Front desk and housekeeping staff were particularly courteous and helpful. I asked for more towels and they came up in just a couple of minutes. Our room was clean and comfortable. I was there with my teens for an event. The hotel is family friendly and safe.,Positive,,,,,
"Nice, but ready for updates in the room.",Positive,,,,,
The hotel was very dated. The door out to the balcony didnâ€™t lock.,Neutral,,,,,
Needed wash clothes,Neutral,,,,,
My stay at Hyatt Green Bay was great. I was in room 432. The toilet needs an upgrade to a newer style. It was extremely small and low to the ground. I'm sure it's not the only one like this in the hotel.,Positive,,,,,
Cleanliness of room was sub par as is general maintenance of room.  Rusted out places in bathroom and frayed carpet.,Positive,,,,,
"Re condition of hotel, most was outstanding, but worn seating in common areas and worn off paint on bathroom shelving was noted.",Positive,,,,,
Improve the speed of your elevators. Brutally slow with all the conference attendees,Negative,,,,,
We LOVED our room!,Positive,,,,,
"The rooms were fabulous!  Staff was responsive and helpful.  I can't evaluate housekeeping staff, as I declined all housekeeping services during my stay. I would have appreciated having a diffuser attachment for the hairdryer.",Positive,,,,,
kleenex were hidden.  found on the day of departure.  Tub was slippery when wet.  No towel bars to hang hand and bath towels.  Freezer in refrigerator was encased in frost and not useable.,Positive,,,,,
The people did a real good food service was unreal,Positive,,,,,
Great room.,Positive,,,,,
"I was part of the Rotary Tri-Con planning committee.  Leslie did an outstanding job of understanding our needs, and anticipating the next need.  Everything was wonderful, as far as I could see.  Thanks.",Positive,,,,,
I know this seems trivial but I loved your fruit-infused water by the front desk!,Positive,,,,,
The conference center was very cold.,Negative,,,,,
"The rooms were nice, carpet in the rooms were lifting from the floor and could cause a tripping hazard. They seemed clean but it just made the overall feel of the room feel old or damaged.",Negative,,,,,
Iâ€™ve provided my feedback above.,Positive,,,,,
"Improve your toilet paper.  The thermostat was quite touchy to regulate.  For shorter individuals, the bed was very high and difficult to get into.",Positive,,,,,
Staff in the onsite coffee shop was the only unfriendly staff member I encountered.,Negative,,,,,
I thought the wait staff at the bar and restaurant were not vey effective and attentive. Never received a second cup of coffee at either breakfast.,Positive,,,,,
"Disappointed in the facilities.  Outdated, in disrepair in some instances; service in the restaurant was sub par-cold toast, dry omelets.  One server!",Negative,,,,,
Meeting rooms were freezing both Friday and Saturday.  Meals were 'ok'.  AV equipement for meetings was not great.,Negative,,,,,
Hotel is getting tired,Negative,,,,,
"Elevators excruciatingly slow.
Unexpected charge for parking when gates were left open and I didn't need to pay.
Only used hotel because of convention held there.  
Did not like lack of top sheet.
Bedding had sickening sweet smell that set off allergies
No electric outlet near bed.",Negative,,,,,
"Anastasia was a doll for modifying my reservation. I had an ADA room. FYI, the vanity is way to high for someone in a wheelchair and the room door on an ADA room should not automatically close. Hard to handle luggage, a wheelchair, and a door at the same time.",Negative,,,,,
"Front desk check-in staff, seemed busy to get us checked in, did not listen really to me when I asked about walking distances.  Then our conference was at the farest away point possible.",Negative,,,,,
"While immaculate, the decor is dated and lacking. Both lampshades were torn, the inner curtain was stained, the outer curtain was off the hook and rod and the furniture is pretty beat up. The staff is knowledgeable and very nice and the hotel is very clean.",Positive,,,,,
See above paragraph.,Positive,,,,,
"I believe the toilets are too small to accommodate the needs of most people.  I am only 5'6 and slightly overweight but I wish the Hyatt GB would mirror other Hyatts and put in regular size toilets, thank you for asking",Positive,,,,,
Tired rooms. Staff overall friendly and helpful.,Positive,,,,,
the front desk staff was extraordinary!   so welcoming and friendly!,Positive,,,,,
"Time for a remodel. Carpet is worn, furnishings dated.",Neutral,,,,,
"We loved our stay, except, the height of the bed. I am old and short. It was a real struggle getting intoâ€¦ONTOâ€¦the bed. That, unfortunately, will keep us from staying with you again.",Negative,,,,,
"Stock the executive suite with a few basics: plates, glasses and a knife, maybe a bowel for snacks. Hard to use the space without the bare minimum",Positive,,,,,
The Hyatt team did a terrific job hosting the Titletown Tradathon Show! Hope to see you again for same. Thank you!,Positive,,,,,
"Samantha (morning shift) at the front desk was exceptional and very helpful. I told her of my needs and she helped me with paper, tissues, and put the requests in for remote fix and blanket. When housekeeping came on Friday afternoon, I also requested the blanket from her, but she never came through with it. The Saturday housekeeping gal was good.",Positive,,,,,
Checking in and checking out were outstanding.,Positive,,,,,
Front desk people were awful,Negative,,,,,
You could let guests know parking is $10/night additional.   It wasnâ€™t mentioned in the online reservation.   Kind of shitty to find that out after I received my final statement.,Positive,,,,,
"When I made my reservation, I was supposed to have Riverview instead looked at the rooftop, checked in late, looking for a cup of coffee, four dollars and $.50, walked to the coffee shop around the corner instead, an additional $50 for late check out? Requested creamer for the coffee I did have in my room she said sheâ€™d send it up and never did, not even a complementary water or a glass do you drink water from the sink? Just was not a good experience at all.",Positive,,,,,
Please fix your drinking fountains.,Positive,,,,,
Coffee in shop by lobby to expensive,Negative,,,,,
"The toilet in the room took a long time to flush and it did not appear to be an ADA compliant toilet - was very low to use, however, I did not request an ADA compliant room.",Positive,,,,,
Very impressed with the hotel and will stay again for sure.,Positive,,,,,
"The parking exit was not keyed to my room card. This caused delays and frustration. 
We had even check prior to attempting to leave the parking area and was assured that I only needed to use my key card to exit. Not true. It had not been set up properly.",Positive,,,,,
needs to be updated,Negative,,,,,
"The hotel shows it age and wear. Carpets rolled, furniture scratched and marred. Some agent makeup light in bathroom,  curtain covering closet,  floor between bed and patio not vacuumed, bathroom with musty? Odor. Elevator and lobby area dirty or worn. Garbage cans overflowing by Elevators. Just worn and tired, needs a  refresh.",Negative,,,,,
Nothing more to say.,Positive,,,,,
The side of the hotel next to Main St. Is very loud. The traffic sounded like it was in my room. The rooms was so clean and nice otherwise. Just loud traffic.,Positive,,,,,
Put some $ into updating the rooms .,Negative,,,,,
Some problem with wedding rooms,Neutral,,,,,
"SKYE WAS AWESOME, VERY HELPFUL!",Positive,,,,,
It would be nice if the front staff knew about these special group codes.  I had to ask 2 different people and no one knew how to help.  Then the front person at night said to come at 9 in the morning the next day when a manager could help.  Code online when going to your website does not work to get the pricing if $82-105.  92243 does not work.  Thankful Jess assisted and got it all worked out.,Positive,,,,,
Staff was attentive. This is not a staff issue.,Positive,,,,,
"I was there as part of a high school group.  After booking, I was contacted and asked to take a King bed suite.  I agreed on the condition that my room was in close proximity to my students' room.  They were on the 5th floor; I was on the 8th floor.",Positive,,,,,
Not what I expect when I go to a Hyatt.  This experience damaged your brand in my mind.,Positive,,,,,
The only thing I did not like was the cost of the snacks and drinks in the store in the lobby.  Quite expensive.,Positive,,,,,
"My room was beautiful and I had a good experience with checking in to my personal room (as the bride). However-since this stay was for my wedding, I did have issues with and was very disappointed with the room block we had set up for our guests. Rooms were scattered throughout the hotel (which defeats the purpose of a room BLOCK) and the rooms we were promised (in my signed CONTRACT) for early check in on Saturday weâ€™re not ready on time. I understand things happen, however the communication with this issue was extremely lacking. If rooms were not available for early check in (again that was signed upon in a contract) I as the person who signed the contract should have been notified of potential problems and solutions. Instead I was kept in the dark until angry guests contacted me stating they couldnâ€™t check in. I know check in was at 4, but my ceremony started at 3 and my own parents (parents of the bride) couldnâ€™t even check in until 1:50pm. Iâ€™m sure you can see how this is an issue. Again, I know the WPS workers threw the hotel for a loop, but the way our room block and early check in issues were handled were extremely lacking in communication.",Positive,,,,,
When did you start charging $10 a night for parking? That may change our minds about staying in the future and we stay several times a year.,Negative,,,,,
"Stephanie helped me when I called to check in and waited with me on the line to be sure that my reservation went through. She answered all of my questions before, during and after my stay! She is awesome~was very polite and patient. That's rare these days.",Positive,,,,,
"The staff was very friendly as well as helpful. The physical plant was nice but the interior is showing its age. Carpets ,at least in the room needed replacement or at least re- stretching- multiple lifts and ridges. The toilet was made for a four year oldâ€™s body. I am 5â€™9 and 180 lbs and was terribly uncomfortable on it, honestly could barely fit on the seat. Did you save this room for a loyal Hyatt customer using points for the stay?",Positive,,,,,
Nothing else to add.,Negative,,,,,
"I have now stayed here several times, and it gets worse every time. The constant LOUD noise coming up from the atrium until all hours is terrible. People attempting to sleep on the pull out couch stand no chance of getting any sort of decent rest. The fact that there is no sort of â€œquiet hoursâ€ or anything for the open area is unacceptable. 

I also had no ability to make any special requests when I made my reservation, and consequently I ended up with feather pillows, which I am very allergic to. It was a very long night trying to get sleep while sneezing constantly.",Negative,,,,,
Please see above,Positive,,,,,
Everything was alright.  The only concern the PAWLI conference attendees were dissatisfied with the food in the restaurant pub.,Negative,,,,,
The breakfast sandwich was not good at all but the burger was wonderful,Positive,,,,,
Had to request bottled water.  Would have been nice to have some in the room for coffee and drinking.  Also in room coffee service is convenient but a nicer touch would have been to provide the individual servings of coffeemate or half and half.  The one small packet of powdered creamer is not adequate for a two night stay.,Positive,,,,,
You may contact me for further feedback via email. My World of Hyatt account is hhantiques@gmail.com.  Do not telephone me.,Negative,,,,,
I booked and had confirmation for a prepaid rate. I paid in full then was charged again.,Negative,,,,,
"When I checked in I asked if they could validate my parking pass. I was told yes, but was never informed that it would be a $10 fee. I didnâ€™t realize I was charged for this until after I checked out.",Positive,,,,,
Jessica - I believe front service manager helped ensure we got the room we wanted!,Positive,,,,,
I asked for cups and was told no.,Negative,,,,,
The club 332 was horrible food was under cooked an nothing was fresh it was bad,Negative,,,,,
"I had to speak with the front desk about an employee walking into my room and startling my additional guest because they walked in looking for dirty towels, which sure they apologized when they ran into the guest but I reported this to the front desk as well. Considering I declined room service in the am since I was underdressed when they came knocking and I stopped later to the front desk and asked for someone to be sent to swap towels and take my garbage/recycling. So I found it unacceptable that someone came wandering in the room to which I obviously reported it to the front desk.",Negative,,,,,
new service staff needs training. one guy good othe tries but needs experience they did not return my Visa CC when i paid. i noticed when 200 miles away the next day,Positive,,,,,
My suggestion for â€œin roomâ€ experience.   Get remotes that have the â€œ-â€œ for sub channels.  Having to hit channel up and down is an annoyance.,Neutral,,,,,
The bathroom could do with a bit of an upgrade. The fixed head shower is not very useful in reaching certain parts of the anatomy that are critical to wash!!,Positive,,,,,
"Great hotel, old, but kept up!",Positive,,,,,
Jessica the front desk manager called because my credit card was declined. I just had to transfer funds. She totally understand and made me feel like I was her friend. I was not at all embarrassed because of her. It was all taken care of in minutes. She was so great. Love these group of people. We spent close to 2000.00 just at the hotel. We asked for a check out at 2 because I wanted more time to myself before going back to chaos. We could have waved the 25.00 fee right...?,Positive,,,,,
"If there were other Hyatt options in Green Bay, I'd happily leverage them.  Unfortunately, this is the closest hotel to me and the only option in Green Bay.  It's a pretty dated property that has had maintenance issues each time I've stayed and definitely doesn't reflect what I've come to expect from other Hyatt properties.  The first time I stayed there, the water was shutoff hotel-wide in the morning when I was trying to get ready to leave.  Both times I've stayed here, I was charged for parking and should not have been either time.",Positive,,,,,
I was quite disappointed in the quality of items... our bathroom had two wash clothes one white one black. The white one literally fell apart as I was using it. We had 2 shampoos and no body wash. No coffees. I understand that these are extremely petty but we have noticed a lack of attention to details the last few visits. However the staff was amazing this time which was an issue in the past.,Negative,,,,,
Asking customers if they need parking validation prior to leaving. I had never used that and did not know.,Neutral,,,,,
I stayed 2 days. The only disappointing thing was parking. I needed a ticket to enter the parking lot. The following day I left for a while..I was charged $12.00 to leave the parking lot.. and needed a ticket to get back in to the parking lot.. and charged $12.00 when I left the hotel.. I was also charged $10 for both days to park.. that's $44 to park for 2 days.. and would have been more if I came and went more those days.. VERY Disappointed..,Negative,,,,,
Looking forward to staying with you at womens state bowling in March 2025,Positive,,,,,
Validation of parking after every in and out was annoying and time consuming,Negative,,,,,
"Breakfast menu has changed, and it no longer has my favorite â€œGarden omeletteâ€ :-)",Positive,,,,,
I have called and left a message for the manager twice and a call back would be awesome.,Positive,,,,,
"#1 Could you get taller toilets?  For tall or older people, shorter toilets are difficult to get up from. 
#2 Could you add seating along the way to the conference center.  I had guests with me that found the walk very long and tiring.  A chair or two along the way would have been very much appreciated!",Positive,,,,,
Great place and stay. A bit disappointed that the hot tub was not working the last two nights but I greatly appreciate that the venue is open until midnight - it really makes a difference to guests who are out and about and want to relax a bit late at night before going to bed. Thank You!,Positive,,,,,
For the high price should have had free breakfast. Had to pay for parking on top of the high price and the gate never worked had to call for assistance everytime,Positive,,,,,
The food was mediocre. One particular thing was that the salsa made were very old.,Negative,,,,,
"We enjoyed our stay, we loved the common space that was available for all the families to use.",Positive,,,,,
"Breakfast was extremely expensive. The service was good. There was a very long wait time - for what seemed like very few people in the restaurant & the staff did a fine job of navigating that -- just very expensive. If we would have realized this, we would have gone somewhere else to eat or brought our own food. 
Also - paying for parking was outrageous. We had to pay multiple times to get out of the parking lot for the events we were in town for. There was no scanning of the hotel card to let us out. 
The hotel itself was nice.
But, due to price of food & parking -- it REALLY increased the total cost of staying there - which would then make me not able to recommend to others if they can find a different place to stay.",Positive,,,,,
The stay was fine other then the ice machine didn't work on our floor and when I traveled to the next floor it didn't work there either. A continental breakfast would have been nice.,Positive,,,,,
"Rest rooms and bedrooms need to change too taller toilets.
Expand menu for dinner. Very few and poor selection for dinner. Ice cold beer was perfect.",Positive,,,,,
"This hotel used to be very nice but has had a steep decline in cleanliness, and the restaurant downstairs is poorly run.",Positive,,,,,
Only had a few complaints. 1.) My room 227 did not have a do not disturb card. 2.) Housekeeping did not shut my door all the way. when they were done. That was quite upsetting as my stuff could have easily been stolen. I was also on alert with my pepper spray b/c I didn't know who was in there 3.) I recently attended a conference and the 3 female bartenders on Thursday night (3/7/2024) were very unfriendly and made it clear that they did not want to be there. This made ordering more drinks unenjoyable.,Negative,,,,,
Make air conditioning available to  cool off the room. Could not sleep at night because room was way too hot.,Positive,,,,,
Also told two restaurants and a lounge upon bookingâ€¦,Negative,,,,,
I wish we'd been notified the hot tub was not in working order.,Positive,,,,,
"Only critique would be bar staff seemed a bit overwhelmed after conference let out. To be expected, however, a few more staff could have made the experience more enjoyable.",Positive,,,,,
"Your staff were all amazing. I've never met a more helpful, well-trained bunch of folks at any hotel I've ever stayed at for business or pleasure.",Positive,,,,,
"ALL staff were very friendly and helpful, even the housekeeping staff were friendly when riding elevators together.  Front desk staff were VERY helpful, professional and friendly.  They answered all questions and went above and beyond.",Positive,,,,,
Breakfast was atrociously priced and there was not a single option for kids.,Negative,,,,,
The pull out couch was terribly uncomfortable.,Positive,,,,,
Disappointed that it took so long to get our room. Kids were wanting to swim and we couldnâ€™t allow them that time without the room. We had a friend get sick from the breakfast so we decided not to eat it.,Positive,,,,,
"The bartender on duty the evening of 3/6 was spectacular.  She was the only one tending.  You have a monster bar and she was hitting every customer with a smile.  She also took food orders and followed up to make sure if food was good.  Before college I tended bar in a large setting like this, but had other tenders to address a full bar.  She is a rock star.  Give her a raise!",Positive,,,,,
Parking was the only issue I had. I was told by your staff that when I left the City of Green Bay lot they would open the gate nobody responded and I had to pay $17 fee .,Negative,,,,,
I should've asked but I was disappointed there was no continental breakfast. The on site restaurant was very pricy for a family. The French toast was delicious but it the wait was very long and was overall expensive. Our waitress was not mean but not overly friendly either.,Positive,,,,,
I don't think I have ever felt as comfortable in a hotel as I did at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I was extremely pleased with my room and would definitely stay there again!,Positive,,,,,
getting door signs stating you are still in your room and not to come clean. I had leftovers that were thrown away and my room was cleaned prior to checking out of my room. I was in a conference room during the morning hours and wanted to get my leftovers at the last minute of check out time b/c I wanted my leftovers to last on my drive home. My number is 715-432-0404,Positive,,,,,
"Overall, the room was clean. The sliding window/door had not been cleaned in quite some time. There were crusty (assuming dog) prints all over the lower 3rd of the window. 2 in our party ordered breakfast off the menu. They were served partially burnt french toast. Prpobably wouldn't eat there again for the cost.",Positive,,,,,
The 8th floor was a bit overwhelming and would have to say next time I would request not to be on it.   With the glass elevators and the fear of heights.    But I know now to check on this at check in.,Negative,,,,,
"There on business travel, colleagues had there rooms overbooked and given to new parties in the middle of our conference. Will not recommend to conference we use your facility again.",Positive,,,,,
"The room (812) is starting to show a little wear and tear. Dust on the ceiling where the duct work blows out (more noticeable when lying in bed). No paper list of TV channels and didn't understand how to use the ""casting"" feature. I was surprised how much street noise I could hear through my windows on the 8th floor- I'm not sure that they can be completely closed.",Negative,,,,,
"Ticket machine was broken upon arrival so could not drive up to entrance to drop off bags conveniently at check in.  Check in staff we're not very friendly, basically said not being able to get in the parking lot was no big deal as I would only have to pay for ramp parking for a few hours.  Room was nice, bathroom a bit tiny.  Breakfast service was exceptionally slow even though the restaurant was almost empty. Very expensive for what we got.  Front desk woman working on Sunday following our stay (we checked out Saturday) was exceptional at helping with a lost item when I did not hear back from housekeeping.  She honestly was wonderful. (Front desk Saturday night assured me I would receive a call right away Sunday if I left a message and though i did leave a message, i did not hear back as of mid morning and since I had friends still at the hotel, I needed to reach someone before they left.  I tried housekeeping again Sunday mid morning with no luck but the front desk person was able to check and get back to me within 45 minutes.  Very much appreciated and saved me an hour drive because my friend was able to bring the item back for me).",Positive,,,,,
I was upset because my room wasnâ€™t ready until almost 6:30pm for a 4pm check in.,Positive,,,,,
We stayed on the 8th floor and there was a vent in the bathroom under the sink at the bottom of the wall that constantly blew cold air into the bathroom making it VERY cold while in there with the door closed.,Negative,,,,,
Hotel was a bit cold...especially convention center.,Neutral,,,,,
Earlier check in and more availability for a conference event,Neutral,,,,,
The food at the hotel restaurant was terrible and over priced for the quality. I would not recommend eating in the restaurant. And the market was also very overpriced! $3.00 for a bottle of water is ridiculous!,Negative,,,,,
"Breton and the lady that checked us in were great. I understand they have a lot of other things they were doing. Anytime I talked to them they were polite and maybe just didn't know what was going on elsewise. The time and amount of times I had to call about the internet to literally get yelled at, my spouse will vouch for this, they were upset with me when the whole party was first day gaming, second day swimming. Well things didn't go as expected the kids wanted to play games, we swam a little the next day, then I was going to go with my daughter before we left the last day, our keys didnt work not one time but numerous, they had to come unlock the door for us. I even had set up the bluetooth key still no luck. Was just all over the place, construction, lack of cleanliness, and attention to things that really do matter was unpleasant and when kids are complaining about the dirtiness you know it's bad as kids don't care about that kind of stuff normally.",Negative,,,,,
Elevators are very slow and stairs are creepy and dirty. It would have been nice to have a continental breakfast,Negative,,,,,
The elevators are really slow. The restaurant is also very slow. Our eggs didn't come with toast and we waited 25 minutes to get it and had to ask 3 people. We asked for 4 slices and the server came back with one. Eggs were cold by the time I got my toast to eat it with.,Negative,,,,,
"This is a great space and besides the broken fan in the bathroom, everything was wonderful. The breakfast at Pub 333 was delicious but the service was incredibly slow and not super friendly.",Positive,,,,,
This just was not a Hyatt worth experience at all. Expected much more with the name and the price.,Positive,,,,,
"Packer room was great, but no blackout curtains so I was up super early. Also slowest elevator in the world...only reason for the 5 rating.",Positive,,,,,
Elevators are slow and small for size of hotel.,Negative,,,,,
"I was told Iâ€™d get an emailed receipt, but I havenâ€™t received any type of email but this one. So I wasnâ€™t even communicated the final price of my stay. There was a disconnect somewhere and I was unsatisfied. I would like someone to contact me to explain in more detail.",Positive,,,,,
My husband contacted Hyatt with our incident and we have heard nothing back. Itâ€™s now been over 2 business days.,Positive,,,,,
"We didnâ€™t have the best service at the restaurant. Never received silverware or napkins, we had to go to the bar and get bar napkins for ourselves. Also never saw our servers again until the bill came. Drinks were never refilled.",Negative,,,,,
Prepare more when hosting large events and train servers to not say they are out of things when they are not.,Positive,,,,,
"The hotel appears to be an older property and has been remodeled several times.  The rooms were a little tight in spaces but serviceable. Stairwell signage could be improved, for example the southwest stairs end at the 2nd floor (not the 1st) and you have to go through several doors to get to the 2nd floor of the hotel or down the skywalk stairs to get  to the 1st floor.",Positive,,,,,
The process to get in the gate and out of the gate for parking was a real challenge as the key did not work at either date to exit and to get it was hard as well.  When we rang the bell or phone it did not pick up but ring and ring.  This should be looked at,Positive,,,,,
I carpooled with my co-worker for an event and Hyatt charged both of us for parking even though we only had one vehicle.  Have your employees check for the parking stub when guests check out before charging them a parking fee.,Negative,,,,,
"Rooms are as expected.  Lunch and dinner meals were fine at KI, but the breakfast left something to be desired.",Positive,,,,,
Breakfast anything would have been great,Positive,,,,,
Large windows by conference center need to be cleaned,Positive,,,,,
"The front desk staff and personnel were excellent!!!! Very pleasant, helpful.  The staff at the 333Pub were excellent as well and the food was great.",Positive,,,,,
I will not recommend anyone to this particular Hyatt hotel. I am very disappointed and was furious no follow up or inquiry by management was made to me during my stay. Hearing that multiple others experienced the same thing is unbelievable. I am very angry and sad for those that will stay after me. Improvement is severely needed.,Positive,,,,,
bathroom vents could have been cleaner,Positive,,,,,
Iâ€™d love to see a wide selection of Green Bay Area beers at the bar,Positive,,,,,
"The Milwaukee Hyatt had an amazing breakfast buffet, I was really sad Nothing was offered.",Positive,,,,,
Not having complementary breakfast is a huge disservice.  Then having an overpriced restaurant was a turnoff.  I ended up getting breakfast at Kwik trip.,Positive,,,,,
"We didn't have enough bathroom linens, I had to call and request. We had 3 littles in our room and 1 wash cloth. The room gets stuffy, no fan in bathroom, or room. Very loud at night on the street. A fan would be helpful to drown out noise. TY",Negative,,,,,
Carpeting in my room looked poor & was not flat against the floor in a couple of areas. Iâ€™ve machine on the floor I stayed on was out of service.,Negative,,,,,
"The lady at front desk when we arrived was Awesome and when we left Sunday, was as Awesome or more.  Sunday's lady was Super Helpful in every way.",Positive,,,,,
Elevators slow or not working bartenders very rude,Negative,,,,,
the only thing is the rooms we stayed in which was rooms 200 floor was on the side of the busy street and the car racing etc was terrible. no fault of the hotels but the sound was gard to sleep hearing,Negative,,,,,
The pull-out bed in my room was terribly uncomfortable.,Negative,,,,,
An update to the property should be done. Not just paint and carpet.,Positive,,,,,
The room was too hot and we couldnâ€™t chance the thermostat.  The front desk was able to adjust it remotely.  The restaurant was expensive and the salad was below mediocre.  But the room was a great size and the price was fair.,Positive,,,,,
"The only downside is the difficulty parking at check-in. Unless you are familiar with the hotel, you do not know to take a ticket that they will validate when you check-in. I ended up driving around and finding a temporary parking space to check in and get my key card.",Positive,,,,,
room was super clean and comfy but the temp was way too high and room super dry on the third floor,Positive,,,,,
Parking fee was not anticipated. Didnâ€™t know I had to validate the ticket. Had to insert my credit card to pay $21 to exit. Would have parked in the ramp had I known. Is monitored by the city I was told so nothing the hotel can do about it. Still watching my card for the fee. We have stayed here twice before and never paid for parking. Long line of cars trying to exit after an event so couldnâ€™t back out to see the hotel desk.,Negative,,,,,
"Adult time in the pool never happened, kids everywhere.",Negative,,,,,
Always enjoy staying here,Positive,,,,,
Noiseproofing - something to make the rooms quieter from traffic outside & kids running around the atrium. The beds also desperately need new mattresses.,Positive,,,,,
Parking fee is also a bit ridiculous when youâ€™re paying $150 for a room in February.,Positive,,,,,
The bar manager was awesome. All staff was friendly,Positive,,,,,
"This is my first time to this hotel.  For a Hyatt Regency I was expecting a nicer room.  The lobby and atrium was redone nicely but the rooms need a major facelift.  The furnishings are OK but the room is dated.   I'ts like a flash back to the 80s.   The bathroom has a toilet that is the lowest I have ever seen to the ground.   Carpet is loose/lifting in areas.    Room 230 has a locked closet in it.  Its a bit sketchy as you don't know what is behind the door and there is no deadbolt on your side of the door.    This is a old embassy suites,  it has good bones but it is not up to a Hyatt level hotel.",Positive,,,,,
Overall staff and facility met my needs. I will stay at this facility in the future when in Green Bay Area. My only negative is that the toilets in all the rooms are extremely low profile. Was not a problem for me butâ€¦. any person with leg/knee/mobility issues could find this to be a real show stopper.,Negative,,,,,
Check in was speedy and staff was friendly answering our questions.,Positive,,,,,
I've never felt so gaslighted and embarrassed while checking in to a hotel.  I've worked in hotel hospitality for many years. I've loved staying at this location yearly for over 15 years.  I don't know if I will be back Leisurely or as a coach again.,Positive,,,,,
Elevators were broken on several occasions throughout our stay,Negative,,,,,
"the Bathroom needs updating ,the toilet was way too low for elderly guests and the shower did not have any handrails.",Negative,,,,,
The halls were and rooms were very noisy until midnight. We had an athlete that had to compete the next day,Negative,,,,,
Zoe was extremely helpful getting us what we needed for our room.,Positive,,,,,
We had breakfast from the buffet Sunday morning.  Most of the hot foods were cold.  My husband broke out in a rash we believe from the shampoo,Positive,,,,,
I have stayed at this hotel 5 times I believe and have never encountered such awful service. I watched a housekeeper put his hands on two younger guys preventing them from leaving the elevator first. The front desk woman was AWFUL.,Negative,,,,,
"During our stay, we needed some extra towels, etc. When I called down for them, they were brought to our room within five minutes. Extremely quick service was appreciated. The housekeeping staff also took care of our needs very quickly.",Positive,,,,,
Offer warm quick breakfast options at the market,Positive,,,,,
Service was slow at the restaurant,Negative,,,,,
Elevators took an extremely long time.  Service and food at restaurant were okay.  Very over priced for what you got.,Positive,,,,,
No longer offer breakfast except in the wayyy over priced bar.  The elevators only worked half the time so for a period of time only 1 of 4 elevators worked meaning youâ€™d have to wait 20 mins to get up to your room or down to the lobby (from higher floors),Positive,,,,,
All interaction with the front desk all weekend was exceptional.  The staff did an outstanding job accommodating the guests at both check in and check out.,Positive,,,,,
I rated it as expected because of past stays. We have always had a great experience with every time we visited this location!!,Positive,,,,,
Parking costs up front about on webpage.,Positive,,,,,
"Over all was good, I was at the conference center.",Positive,,,,,
Need to do a better job of in the restaurant.,Positive,,,,,
The problem we had was we were late for the bank what we were supposed to attend. Because of parking we could not find a parking stall. Ended up parking in a different motels parking area. We were unable to get our money back for that banquet,Negative,,,,,
Please add towel bars or hooks to the rooms,Positive,,,,,
Check your thermostats,Neutral,,,,,
The housekeeping staff was GREAT!,Negative,,,,,
"Our banquet food was terrible.   Uncooked/woody green beans on a hot buffet, scrambled eggs was like eating sand, bacon was so over done it just crumbled when we tried to pick it up.   Server used same gloves to clear tables and combine pastries from one buffet line to another.",Positive,,,,,
Staff was great  about all of this.  Very helpful,Negative,,,,,
The room was very warm when I got there.  I turned the therometer way down but it still took awhile for it to cool down.,Positive,,,,,
Not on par with other Hyatt regency properties,Negative,,,,,
Educate your staff about room features. Get in a wheelchair and attempt to use your bathrooms without use of your legs.,Negative,,,,,
Thank you to the caring team members who made it possible for me to enjoy our conference by anticipating my needs and accommodating my physical limitations due to disability!,Positive,,,,,
It was a very enjoyable stay (our 3rd time here),Positive,,,,,
The carpet is getting a little dated but overall we love this hotel!,Positive,,,,,
I asked for a late checkout as i was running late and was told no.  Then as I was checking out the front desk clerk told someone on the phone that a late checkout was no problem.  That upset me and left a bad taste in my mouth after what was up to that point a great Stat.,Negative,,,,,
I already sent an email and pictures.,Positive,,,,,
"I was advised that due to the length of my visit there wouldn't be housekeeping, but there was. I would have preferred none.",Positive,,,,,
traffic was very noisey at night. need better insulated patio doors thet are old.,Positive,,,,,
everything was beyond what I would expect.   we especially appreciated the perfect pool and hot tub.  thank you.,Positive,,,,,
This hotel needs a total renovation. Very run down. I was there for a conference and the food at the conference was average at best.,Positive,,,,,
Staff was great. Cleaning needed to be a little better. Room lighting needs to be better. Very dim in every room. In general needs to be updated.,Positive,,,,,
There were kids 10 and under running around unsupervised from 10pm to 2am no one was able to find their mother. I was very disappointed that I could not rest and enjoy my stay in peace.,Positive,,,,,
The pool was terrible.you could not even see through the water and it had a green color.,Negative,,,,,
"When we checked in the front desk person was very helpful and asked what plans we had in Green Bay.  My brother and I stated we were here to visit a brother who was in a assisted living facility.  Our brother was injured in Viet Nam in 1967, and now had two strokes.  All three of three of us brothers were in Viet Nam.  The next day I was given a thank card with 12 thank you messages signed by employees and a gift certificate.  I have never been given a thank you card in my entire military career or after I retired from the Air Force.  The card meant more to me than the gift certificate (the certificate was very nice).  My other two brothers were very appreciative of the card and I will keep the card.  CMSgt retired after 23 years of service.",Positive,,,,,
Housekeeping for room 717 was wonderful- very tidy and clean -especially the bed prep.,Positive,,,,,
"The rooms were nice, but the bathrooms could use some updating",Positive,,,,,
The staff were great!  Held my moms 80th birthday party there and it was wonderful. Breakfast was slow to get and it was as if our waitress was also the cook. But she was great. My 5yo neice asked for the fruit bowl but only wanted strawberries and I really believe the waitress prepared a bowl of just strawberries for her.  So thankful!!!,Positive,,,,,
The a/c & heating needs to also be updated.  You could only have heat at this time.  I need a cool room and I had to have the fan shut off.  Thank goodness they had fans available,Positive,,,,,
"WE WERE HAPPY THEY KEPT THE BAR OPEN LATER FOR US TO SOCIALIZE WITH FREINDS WE DON'T SEE THAT OFTEN.
Ufortunately some of the bottles of BUD Light tasted skunky, but the bartender was great with replacing them.",Positive,,,,,
They charged me for parking & I didn't even have a vehicle there. Ridiculous! They charged $25.00 for early check-in! Really?!!,Negative,,,,,
"Very nice hotel and staff, butâ€¦
That tiny toddler toilet should come with a warning. Not good for old knees.",Positive,,,,,
Price was real affordable and the place was a palace,Positive,,,,,
Great and beautiful hotel just first time there and getting a cheap room as a good experience overall a few maintenance things which arenâ€™t a big deal,Positive,,,,,
"Pool area is clean, however the rack labeled pool towels did not have any towels. Needed to return to my room to get a room towel.",Positive,,,,,
"Maybe more pasta options for dinner at the pub, but it is still very good",Positive,,,,,
Although just an overnight stay it was great and most of the staff was great. The only negative thing I have to say was that when we went to breakfast in the restaurant the person who waited on us came over to take our food order and deliver it and then the next time we saw them was to give us a check,Positive,,,,,
"I like the floorplan, and the ease of plugging in my computer to the desk TV as a second monitor getting work done.  If I had family with me, they could have easily watched TV in the bedroom area and I could still get work done.",Positive,,,,,
"When I booked this room ""free breakfast"" was included. Not even free coffee. Matter of fact $9 for 2 cups of absolutely lousy coffee!",Positive,,,,,
"The one area of concern I have is you having Encore as part of your convention center. They are not representing you well! They dont communicate well, they are not open to suggestions and they are always looking to charge you for everything and the prices are very high! I would consider dropping them as they are NOT helping your business. They are not well liked in the industry is what we hear.",Positive,,,,,
The room was very warm.  I had to leave the sliding balcony door open all night to get the room down to a comfortable temperature.,Positive,,,,,
Not sure of the Gentleman's name but he was a shuttle driver. And was very rude I was waiting on a parking space to come available and said he security and I need to move. Also very limited parking,Negative,,,,,
Had a great stay..absolutely impressed with your fitness room..Samantha was a great host..nico was much friendlier this time too..,Positive,,,,,
"Having my room ready for early check-in was great!!! Hardly ever happens and was very appreciated!  Roomâ€™s are showing their age (90s) and everything felt expensive, with a nickled and dimed sort of energy. (Parking, breakfast, etc)",Positive,,,,,
Breakfast was too expensive,Positive,,,,,
"Truly a lovely experience, and we will be back! We loved the festive atmosphere, the live music, the kind staff, and the large rooms making it easy to gather with other family staying!! Thank you!",Positive,,,,,
The desk people were amazing and the room wonderful,Positive,,,,,
Restaurant food and service was not good especially over the weekend. Servers were not well trained. Food quality was mediocre and took 20-30 minutes to receive and the restaurant was not busy. Servers were not familiar with menu or knew drinks. I ordered a grey goose vodka and seven/sprite. Server had to have another server come over as he did not understand; this is a pretty basic order. Hubby ordered bbq pulled pork sandwich; he got a bbq hamburger. Nachos were not warm and had almost no meat/ground beef on it. Appeared to have been warmed a couple of times at least.,Positive,,,,,
"I was surprised about the $10 parking fee. That was not disclosed in the booking, nor was it expected.",Negative,,,,,
Totrally awesome experience,Positive,,,,,
"Dingy mismatched furniture looks like it was rescued from Goodwill.
Windows are dirty and/or etched. Film covering is peeling off.
Draperies are old, discolored and dirty. Pull is broken.
No place to set your drink when sitting down.
NOISE! Band playing in atrium. Cornhole game in atrium until after 11:00 p.m.
Broken gate allows parking lot to fill up; not enough parking for guests.
Carpet in room is buckled and dirty.
Refrigerator is noisy and actually vibrated the floor. We had to turn it off.
Bathroom wall vent grille is loose and dirty.",Negative,,,,,
"The hotel is very dated and not consistent with other Hyatt Regency level hotels. Although pleased with the suite upgrade, the room quality and decor was from the 1990â€™s. Very hard to compete with the Northland which is a Marriott property.",Positive,,,,,
"I had reserved a corner suite which was supposed to be slightly bigger according to website, but was placed in a standard suite. This Hyatt is the best hotel in the area for families because of the pool area. We love staying here!",Positive,,,,,
Rooms were very warm. I heard a lot of the guests turned their thermostat down but there was no real impact. The only way to really cool the room down was to open the patio door.,Positive,,,,,
"We always enjoy staying at this hotel and like the location. Staff is always very friendly,
rooms are comfortable, and sleep great in the beds.  We enjoy the pool and steam room
and always feel very relaxed and cared for on our stays.",Positive,,,,,
"Your hotel seemed tired.  It had an odor, and needs some love.",Neutral,,,,,
The condition of the room looked a bit dated & could use updating.  There were strips of scotch tape on the walls like someone at some point hung some signs for maybe a party which is fine but someone should remove the tape as it looks unkept.  When opening the sofa bed it looked as if there was a blood stain on the comforter so it wasnâ€™t used.,Neutral,,,,,
Would very much like to see buffet breakfast back. Iâ€™m willing to pay the cost of variety,Positive,,,,,
Loved the quality of the facilities.  We hope to come again!,Positive,,,,,
Disappointed in your lack of customer service for paying hotel guests regarding parking and breakfast. Under previous hotel management these were free to paying guests.,Negative,,,,,
"Overall a good experience. We did not like having a corner room as much as the rooms we've had in the past, but now we know.",Positive,,,,,
"There was no parking on Saturday night. As a woman traveling alone,it was unnerving walking from the parking structure alone after dark.",Negative,,,,,
I didnâ€™t love the new menu at the restaurant but really thatâ€™s no big deal. We stay here every year and are always so happy to be back!,Positive,,,,,
Really appreciated Margo upgrading our room. Very pleasant surprise.,Positive,,,,,
your hotel appearance seems very dated.,Negative,,,,,
Melody at the Front Desk is OUTSTANDING.  Also had some excellent work done by Bar Manager for a last minute Pop Up beverage service,Positive,,,,,
"We are looking forward to a future stay. This property is close to the Kohler Spa, Lambeau Field and a number of other Green Bay attractions we enjoy. We are also excited about the information the staff shared with us regarding pet friendly offerings. Many thanks.",Positive,,,,,
"Catered food was ok, but all meals were grossly overcooked, the chicken was dry and the steak was so tough you could barely chew it. The freeze dried candy was gross . Some of the healthy options were appreciated like the protein balls and the fresh fruit.",Negative,,,,,
Had to pay for parking and no continental breakfast,Positive,,,,,
"I guess I found myself comparing this Hyatt Regency to the San Diego Hyatt Regencies we've stayed at. I could definitely tell this was a former Embassy Suites.  Bartenders were great.  I guess my only complaint was the female front desk clerk who gave me crap about wanting 3 waters for the 3 of us in the room. She made a point of telling me my Discoverist status only allows 2 waters per day. I've never had that experience at any of the other Hyatts I've stayed, including your the Green Bay property when someone else was working.",Positive,,,,,
We will definitely come back again.,Positive,,,,,
I was very disappointed that the hotel only accepted credit cards for payment of food and drink purchases.,Positive,,,,,
myself and some others did not like the cashless aspect of food and beverage. Each time for the bar it needed the card and myself is not so much for using a card.,Positive,,,,,
"Beds too high off the floor
Toilet too low to the floor 
No grab bars or other safety features in the shower or bath",Positive,,,,,
The tub drain was slow in my room #726,Negative,,,,,
"Were very helpful in getting parking for my vehicle, as hotel lot was full upon on my arrival.",Positive,,,,,
"Our only issue was the height of the toilet, as my wife has issues with her knees & it was very difficult for her to get up without something to grab onto.",Positive,,,,,
Surprised that there was no complimentary coffee,Positive,,,,,
I wish you had free coffee,Positive,,,,,
"Anastasia was wonderful, helpful, and courteous to all my needs while staying there. Room was excellent like always",Positive,,,,,
Bri the food Cafe was wondering was very pleased but the fill in that worked may 15th was not pleasant and was rude,Positive,,,,,
Please raise the toilet. Thought I was sitting on the floor. Banquet food too little and no coffee available? Server told us we had to go to the atrium and spend $4 for a cup.,Positive,,,,,
"Only issue was there wasnâ€™t enough luggage carts for check out, but thatâ€™s nitpicking!!",Negative,,,,,
Very enjoyable and relaxing. All information was very helpful and love to come when in the area again.,Positive,,,,,
I had a very enjoyable experience in Green Bay and Hyatt took care of me like family.,Positive,,,,,
"Staff was great! Entry way was dirty, especially your glass doors.",Negative,,,,,
The food was terrible. Never had good that bad at a convention. And no coffee at the banquet.. very cold food. No gravy for potatoes green beans not done.,Positive,,,,,
Bathrooms in pool area have no mirrors or beach to sit on to change into and out of suite. Pool area very slippery no mats down to prevent falls.,Positive,,,,,
The fan in the Room Air conditioner was very loud had to shut it off at night to get some sleep.,Negative,,,,,
Room was extremely accommodating and clean,Positive,,,,,
Needs major refurb.,Positive,,,,,
No breakfast is bad.  Breakfast options in hotel was expensive and relatively mediocre.,Negative,,,,,
Housekeeping was fantastic.  Room was spotless and all the little things are taken care of,Positive,,,,,
"Itâ€™s good you have overflow parking. This came in helpful on my late night return on Saturday night. I didnâ€™t quite feel safe on the walk back, and am wondering how that could be remedied.",Positive,,,,,
"The beds were too high and hard to get in. The toilet was too low, needs to be upgraded. No fan in the bathtub, shower. Needs upgrades. Carpeting needs to be replaced.",Positive,,,,,
The cable machine in the fitness center is missing a strap/handle.  There is only 1 and there should be 2.,Positive,,,,,
"James at the front desk did a fantastic job getting us checked in and helping with a minor issue. The hotel was nice, but the rooms could use some remodeling and updating.",Positive,,,,,
"The members of staff at the Hyatt Regency Hotel Green Bay, especially these seven mentioned earlier, were very welcoming, friendly, courteous and helpful from the moment that I walked into the hotel with my wife for our vacation to celebrate my milestone birthday and attend a church event in Green Bay.

I received complimentary birthday gifts including a beautiful birthday card, greetings, coffee and a $10 voucher to spend in the hotel's Market.

They gave me advice on the local services and attractions like nearby supermarkets, museum, restaurants, car hire services and even heated up my room when I complained that it was too cold. 

I enjoyed using their clean and functioning facilities like their gym, swimming pool, sauna and steam room. 

Needless to say that I thoroughly enjoyed myself and I did not want my 10-day vacation to end as I truly felt at home as the staff catered to all my needs and when spoilt me a lot. 

This is especially after my baggage was lost on my arrival to Green Bay Airport but later found and delivered to me at the hotel by Delta Airlines, who are in partnership with Hyatt Regency Hotel.

I would definitely recommend the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Green Bay, Wisconsin to anyone planning to stay in the area, as I'm already planning to return there myself.

This is also to say a BIG thank you to the amazing staff at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Green Bay, Wisconsin. You guys are the best. You're awesome! You rock!

Keep up your exceptionally great first-class service.

Your very happy and satisfied guest, Ike.",Positive,,,,,
Ran out of the vegan option in the restaurant which was the reason we picked to stay there. The Fish was all breading and the mac and cheese was like a soup.,Positive,,,,,
I work with Hyatt Manager Leslie Rotter she did an amazing job and was great to plan my event and stay with.,Positive,,,,,
"Very polite, courteous, and helpful staff.",Positive,,,,,
Be able to find a tv channel without going through all the channels,Negative,,,,,
I booked a room with a balcony paid extra did not get a room with a balcony,Positive,,,,,
Your restaurant was very good. We ate there multiple days because the food was well cooked.,Positive,,,,,
"Absolutely everyone from the check-in, market and restaurant were exceptionally nice and helpful.",Positive,,,,,
Just didn't like paying to park. My other hotel points benefits don't charge for parking. It wasn't a busy time for the hotel.,Positive,,,,,
Ik heb geweldig genoten van het korte verblijf. Wat ik zo mooi vond dat je gezien wordt. Heel belangrijk.,Neutral,,,,,
"Overall the experience was wonderful. I feel the room could use a little attention to detail when it comes to caulking around the sink in bathroom, painting/updating bathroom, etcâ€¦ but overall it was a pleasant stay.",Positive,,,,,
"Rude security!!

I was part of the leadership and longevity seminar",Positive,,,,,
"We've stayed here for a number of years when we come to Green Bay and we wouldn't stay any where else. Very convenient. 
We really like the suite.",Positive,,,,,
Cheese on poutine was frozen and breakfast was very greasy but service was great,Positive,,,,,
The vent in our shower was disgusting! It was covered in dirt and crap. The staff was friendly and helpful.,Negative,,,,,
The food at the restaurant was not good. I ordered a french onion soup. The bowl was less than half full. When I bit into the cheese there was cheese paper still in it. I refused to pay for it and did not want to attempt another soup.,Positive,,,,,
Room was clean bed was comfortable. Appearance of hotel seemed a little outdated. Staff was excellent. Check in process was a breeze,Positive,,,,,
Would recommend to friends and family. Hope to return in the future,Positive,,,,,
"The room smelled musty, not ideal.",Positive,,,,,
The air freshener pumped throughout the ventilation system in lobby area was overpowering and not necessary.  I am very sensitive to scents and do not want to breathe in toxic chemicals.   It is not good for anyone's health.  Maybe try something natural like essential oils.,Positive,,,,,
NEED grab bars in the tub/shower,Neutral,,,,,
"The rooms are dated, but the staff was pleasant",Positive,,,,,
I was also charged parking fees for each day but I stayed across the street in the parking ramp and paid those parking fees. Chatted in for help and they couldnâ€™t help me and said it will be 3-5 business days for someone from acccounting to get back to me.,Positive,,,,,
The refrigerator in room 515 was very loud. The room key pad to get back into the parking lot was not operational (the front desk staff mentioned it had been giving people trouble).,Negative,,,,,
"It would have been nice to get a discount on the breakfast, since we were staying there and usually one gets a free breakfast. That being said, this was a better breakfast.",Positive,,,,,
I think the hotel has great potential but definitely could use some updating and remodeling to fit more of the Hyatt standards,Positive,,,,,
Hotel is cool needs some updating. Carpet in my room all bumped up and weird. This is my second stay and both times shower would fill up with water due to clog or something.,Negative,,,,,
"Everyone was very pleasant and welcoming. This is my second time staying here, and both times were outstanding experiences.",Positive,,,,,
Everyone was very friendly.  Restuarant and Marketplace food and beverage and service was excellent,Positive,,,,,
Great place and convenient.,Positive,,,,,
"Everyone in the building was helpful and welcoming, from the cleaning staff, to restaurant staff and front desk staff.",Positive,,,,,
"Room nothing special, bathroom small, toilet clogged when I got there - never really functioned well.",Positive,,,,,
Very clean and beautiful hotel. Will stay in the future.,Positive,,,,,
"I booked the room for my parents to attend a funeral near by, and they were completely amazed at the hospitality, the room itself, and overall experience.",Positive,,,,,
"We have stayed at the Hyatt Green Bay many times over the years when we visit family in Green Bay.  This was the most disappointing trip we've had.  The quality of the beds was so disappointing.  The rooms feel tired.  The carpet feels ""icky"" (the dark brown color just feels like it harbors who knows what).  The sofa bed was terrible!  This might well have been the last time we stay at this hotel given how poorly we slept.",Negative,,,,,
"My brother passed away, I had to get to my family and when asked if I could check out early due to the circumstances I was told Iâ€™m not sure we can turn over the room.  We had come back to the hotel for our bags and the room was already clean.  This was early enough in the day the room could have been still used; however, there wasnâ€™t a demand for the room.  The parking lot was almost empty when we departed.  I just donâ€™t understand why the rate couldnâ€™t have been refunded given the unforeseen circumstances.",Negative,,,,,
Was a great stay. Really loved it there.,Positive,,,,,
Our room was extremely room and there were no instructions on how to rectify this matter. We called rhe front desk to ask for help. They said they would send someone who NEVER came!!,Positive,,,,,
"Jenny, Harsh Savath all in pub333 were amazing",Positive,,,,,
"Absolutely everything was top-notch!! Service was consistently stellar with every single person we encountered treating us as if they truly enjoyed helping customers and truly wanted us to be as happy as possible with our stay. Really, customer service like this is exceedingly rare. It was delightful to stay there and my family will all have extremely fond memories of our stay. I very much hope to stay there again in the future.",Positive,,,,,
"I know it sometimes happens in hotels, but there was lots of running and screaming in the hallways from kids",Negative,,,,,
Very clean and nice!,Positive,,,,,
"the place was beautiful, well cleaned and maintained, the room was comfortable, minus the thermostat not turning down.",Positive,,,,,
"We were unable to address these issues because they were all discovered the next morning as we attempted to shower and unfortunately could not. Upon our departure, the front desk attendant took off charges to help to defray our disappointment with our room/shower/patio etc. I still feel as though the charges for the room were much higher than I would have paid had I known the condition of the room. In truth, I would not have stayed in that room. Hopefully these problems were addressed. If I received a voucher for a free night in the future, I may stay again to see if this Hyatt can meet expectations, and if not, I will stay elsewhere in the future.",Negative,,,,,
"We were very happy to have an extra hour of time for check out and very pleased for the early check in as well. The cafe/restaurant staff were very friendly as well and we had a great meal, and the 24/7 store was really convenient. We look forward to staying there again.",Positive,,,,,
Without a doubt best hotel and staff you can find! Thank you!,Positive,,,,,
Traffic noise was pretty significant making it difficult to sleep.  If there had at least been a fan on the thermostat that could be turned on that may have helped drown out that noise some.,Positive,,,,,
We had a great stay! Loved the pool area - my grandkids loved it! We will most definitely be back!,Positive,,,,,
Why do you have a daily parking fee?,Negative,,,,,
Gorgeous large room. Better than expected. Bed weâ€™re sooo comfortable.,Positive,,,,,
Should include parking and Continental breakfast would have been nice.,Positive,,,,,
"Water bottles in the fridge  
Would be absolutely amazing",Positive,,,,,
Guests should not have to pay for parking if you are paying to stay in the hotel. Also did not like that the hotel bar was cashless.,Positive,,,,,
Food at restaurant is way over priced for portions and quality of food.,Positive,,,,,
"The hotel is beautiful and the amenities were great. The rooms themselves were a little worn, but am thankful they were clean. Overall great value!",Positive,,,,,
Getting out of the parking lot was horrible. It took us over an hour just to leave the parking lot because they allowed unregistered guests to park,Negative,,,,,
"My husband and I ate a quick dinner on Friday evening, April 11th, seated at the bar in the restaurant. For drinks, we ordered only non-alcolholic:  a coffee and an Arnold Palmer, along with our food. The two bartenders, Isaac and Tristan, were exremely good to us, and very friendly: chatting with us about ""this and that"" and got our order together very quickly. We were very impressed with their friendliness and sense of humor !

The beds in the room were very comfortable, with firm mattresses and lovely bedding.

Thank you for your usual ""Hyatt Excellence"" !

Most Sincerely
Nancy Jo and John Baratti in Brookfield, WI",Positive,,,,,
"My stay was excellent. I am so impressed by the staff who were friendly and polite. The room was very clean and comfortable.
My only slight complaint is that first we were told parking was free but I was charged $10 per night. When I left, it took 35 minutes to get out of the lot. One exit was closed and the other not working properly. That was frustrating

I will definitely return when I am in GrrenBay again.",Positive,,,,,
"A few disappointments. The hotel is a little bit dated. It's nicely appointed and I like the suites.  But it was not as comfortable as expected. I brought my brother, who is disabled, for his birthday. He got the king bed with the gigantic and wonderful TV, and I slept in the ""sitting room"" on the sofa sleeper. I can barely walk now, after sleeping on it and driving home yesterday. My lower and upper back are extremely sore. It was also very noisy in the room itself. Cold air blew through the seams around the door to the point that the drapes moved. When someone let their door slam it caused a loud noise that sounded like thunder and rattled everything, scaring my little senior dog and of course people were rude and loud in the hall until very late.  I do not think she relaxed or slept the entire time we were there. She also didn't want to eat. The dog relief area is full of cigarette butts because there was no receptacle for people to use for them. I didn't know I needed to use my parking ticket to get in and out. I thought I was supposed to somehow use my room key. That's on me but it was not clear. 
I bought a sandwich in the snack bar which I assumed was open 24 hours? The server was cleaning everything and when I asked if I could purchase something she was rude and dismissive but took my money. It happens. None of this is terrible. But our bill for two nights was about $500. I purchased the pet package which I assumed was just the pet fee. I am not sure that is true because I think it was more than the pet fee, but there was nothing extra included for the extra expense. I'm an old lady and maybe have some of this wrong. I have a lot of trouble navigating Green Bay. I think it would help if hotels with multiple exits post a sign as to which street they are exiting to and what direction is runs. Provide a decent city map too with directions to highlights from your hotel. GPS is not all that helpful when going through roundabout after roundabout and your passenger is disabled and not able to help much. My dumb phone refused to connect to Bluetooth and he had to try to read the directions. That did not work and we were lost trying to find places we wanted to visit and just wasted so much time. Not the hotel's fault. But overall the trip was not enjoyable. It's a great place if you are attending something at the convention center.  We thought this downtown location would be great for us, but I couldn't walk far with my back so it was not convenient for us.",Positive,,,,,
"Sitting area: Brown carpet, brown accent wall, brown sofa + poor lighting, no windows, no natural light = a depressing, unattractive room.  No climate control.",Negative,,,,,
"When I made the reservation,  I requested a quiet room. Should've specified ""location"" of room. The room was quiet but they gave us our room right next to the elevator!!",Positive,,,,,
Shocked at the condition of the hotel. Stunned that it is allowed to carry Hyatt name.,Negative,,,,,
Above and beyond service! Fri t checkin staff was great and so friendly!,Positive,,,,,
I think that the $10 parking fee is not needed.,Negative,,,,,
We were there for convention and on the first night did not have enough staff in the bar/ eating area.,Positive,,,,,
Just wondering what the quiet hours are. I could hear kids yelling in the center until at least 12:30 am,Positive,,,,,
"The hotel itself seems to be in need of updates.  The windows are water etched or dirty, and the wood surfaces such as room entry doors and cabinetry in the rooms is scratched and marred.",Negative,,,,,
"Breakfast prices too high, toast & jam paying additionally forâ€¦ridiculous",Negative,,,,,
Donâ€™t know whoâ€™s responsible for food catering at conferences but it was awful.,Negative,,,,,
"We will stay here again on our next visit to Green Bay, WI.",Positive,,,,,
Continental breakfast is something every guest would enjoy. We were disappointed we didnâ€™t see any option.,Positive,,,,,
"just an average hotel, but the people there act like it is a 5 star.  I do a lot of work travel and it's unfortunate that our experience last weekend will not have me look at Hyatt Regency GB or any other properties under Hyatt.",Positive,,,,,
Restaurant was poor. Out of food choices on menu. Service slow. Food tasteless,Negative,,,,,
Restaurant wasn't very good and over priced but the hotel was excellent!,Positive,,,,,
Very disappointed because I used to love this hotel and my family had the worst time ever.,Positive,,,,,
Thank you!!!,Positive,,,,,
"The pub food was very poor this time compared to others. Along with that there was no snacks in the breakfast area at all housekeeping was nonexistent to grab her own towels, and the room was not clean",Positive,,,,,
Check was great.  Bartender was great - remembered me from last year.,Positive,,,,,
"When I checked in, the lady working the front desk made a notice about how she saw I am with Associated Bank, but didn't use the code that would have given me free parking, and something else. I did the reservation through our system, and had no idea what she was referring to, and there was a ton of people in the lobby and waiting in line, so I didn't have the opportunity to ask as it was just her. The only options I had at the time of booking was a member rate, which I didn't have, and then standard rate. I didn't see anything for Associated Bank, nor was there a way to enter a code/ID of any kind in the system that I saw.",Positive,,,,,
"The meal service at the Pub 303 was so bad at lunch April 2nd and breakfast April 3rd that both meals were comped. LONG waits for both, with neither time being  busy at all. Staff were aware.",Negative,,,,,
"The housekeeping staff are amazing. The man that checked the van was very rude. It was very disappointing and he was not welcoming.
It was disappointing that you had to pay parking to stay at the hotel.",Negative,,,,,
"You guys have the most comfortable beds. I absolutely love the pillows, sheets and comforters.  I would like to know what kind of pillows, sheets, and comforters you guys use so I can purchase some for at home.",Positive,,,,,
"Room service was disappointing. I splurged for the steak, which was delivered in carton (not on a plate) with plastic silverware and no salt & pepper. Described as having peppercorn sauce and had absolutely none.",Negative,,,,,
Always love staying here but would like the rooms to be lighter. To much brown and it makes the room look and feel darker.,Positive,,,,,
They screwed up one of our registrations and I waited at front desk for 35+ minutes. They kept explaining why it happened instead of apologizing and getting it fixed.,Negative,,,,,
The food was much better two years ago.i stayed there frequently for work. We came for a quick getaway and was bummed by the food. Please correct! Tristan kept the drinks flowing and we appreciated it!,Positive,,,,,
"I would have liked to have had housekeeping services during my stay, but I understand I was there for a conference and it was very busy. However, when I did request new towels and coffee it was delivered to my room quite quickly.",Positive,,,,,
"I love the gym facilities and the equipment; the hotel is well located and accessible.  I had trouble sleeping because of the beds, I never have issues with this, but the beds were really uncomfortable.",Positive,,,,,
The room and public areas were clean and tidy but the overall impression was one of being outdated. The bathroom was small and dowdy. Thought the room would be more swankier.,Positive,,,,,
Family friendly. Nice to take the grandchildren.,Positive,,,,,
Absolutely loved this hotel!,Positive,,,,,
No exhaust fans in the bathroom,Positive,,,,,
"Stay is Green Bay was adequate. Very surprised to have to pay for parking in just a lot. Not underground parking. Was waive if we joined the Hyatt club, but only for first time. Definitely lessens the likehood of staying here when we come to Green Bay every other month. 
Was also taken aback by the only choice for saugivnon blanc was $17 per glass. Also that it was Duckhorn, not even from New Zealand. Room was tired looking.",Positive,,,,,
First time staying here! Very happy with our stay! Great sized room! Kids loved the pool area! Overall great experience and will definitely be staying here again!,Positive,,,,,
"Inappropriate to pay for parking at hotel. Also, the room that I was given had been occupied with a maintenance person. Breakfast was gross, get a real chef.",Negative,,,,,
Went to get breakfast one morning and waited for over five minutes and never saw a server. Ended up leaving because I didn't have a lot of time before I had to leave for work.,Positive,,,,,
The room wasnâ€™t ready when we arrived to the hotel and we waited two hours for a room. The pool was out of towels at one point too. Overall our family enjoyed the rest of the time there! I miss the palm trees in the lobby though,Positive,,,,,
"The hotel is showing age. Time for some investment.
No grab bars on the shower. Tub floor is slippery. Not so good for older guests.",Positive,,,,,
"In recent years we would receive a free drink ticket, parking was free, and they had a wonderful breakfast buffet with cook to order eggs, hotcakes ... etc.  Not anymore, disappointing.",Positive,,,,,
Could be more help in bar when bartender has to go to the kitchen and get things,Neutral,,,,,
Very disappointed in my stay.. more than likely won't return,Positive,,,,,
"The only issue was the room was very hot, and it would not cool off no matter how much I turned the thermostat down.",Positive,,,,,
"The guy working the front desk was very helpful and nice.. Luke maybe was his name? He was wearing a creme colored jacket.. Anyways, helpful and respectful!",Positive,,,,,
Difficult to use the TV,Negative,,,,,
House keeping and front desk staff were very helpful and happy to assist. They are who made a difference in our stay. We will be returning.,Positive,,,,,
it needs some remodeling but overall the experience was really good,Positive,,,,,
"I wasnâ€™t impressed from the moment I walked in. When I was trying to check in, there were two lines & two attendants. There was a sign marked world of Hyatt discoverist, explorist & globalist members, so thatâ€™s where I fell in line since I am a discoverist member. It should be noted that there was an attendant at the computer in front of the line that I was in. That attendant proceeded to move to another computer and started pulling other customers from the main line (not the line I was in for world of Hyatt members) & these were customers who had arrived after me. When one of the customers in the main line so kindly let me in front, I asked the attendant what even is the point of having a separate line for WOH members & she said there is only one line from which they operate from. Which is super silly because it was very clear that WOH discoverist & etc members were to fall in line there. But also both attendants knew I was present before the three people they checked in prior to me so It was not a good start to spend 20 min for the check-in process. 


The second thing Iâ€™d like to mention is the noise level at night time. On our first night, there was drag racing outside, which made it extremely difficult to put my young kids to sleep & settle in myself. I texted the front desk & they offered to switch rooms &/or bring up ear plugs. At that point, it was too late to switch rooms but it was very kind of the front desk. I was hoping they would call the non-emergent hotline for Green Bay PD to shut down the drag races outside. When I brought up the issue to the front desk in the morning, the attendant informed me that it is a normal occurrence, and that if it happens tonight that I, the customer, should be the one to call Green Bay Police Department, which seems very silly to put that responsibility on me.",Positive,,,,,
It took a while to be seated at Pub333 I understand they had a huge party and quite understaffed but we werenâ€™t seated for some time and just ended up seating ourselves. They were apologetic abt the wait and but I think personally if you just acknowledge me and tell me to take a seat or wait to be seated itâ€™ll feel less like you hope I donâ€™t stick around and end up leaving so you donâ€™t have to serve me.,Positive,,,,,
"No more, thank you.",Positive,,,,,
Beautiful the moment you walk in. It was like a city with beautiful plants. Loved that the room had a living room in front and a bar! Beds in the back. Nice set up. We all noted how quiet the room was never even heard a door close.,Positive,,,,,
I had researched a block of rooms would have been nice if we were together or at least on the same floor,Positive,,,,,
"The entire staff was friendly. Please make sure the staff, employees and the cleaning crew get recognized and appreciated, if not in monetary terms, then at least w/a lunch with manager.",Positive,,,,,
"The staff in the lobby restaurant were very friendly, but service was slow and the food was less than great.  I had eggs Benedict for breakfast and everything was swimming in the hollendase sauce and the ham/bacon was burned.",Positive,,,,,
"The pool was cloudy.
The rooms are nice but the facility could use updating.",Positive,,,,,
"My stay at Hyatt Regency was great! The gentleman who checked me in was courteous and attentive! My 2 night stay was great - not 1 complaint. Yes, I would highly recommend your hotel!",Positive,,,,,
Stayed was good,Positive,,,,,
"The customer service was amazing. The bartender, Chase was also amazing and kind and very attentive to our drinks being low and refilling them when we needed the night after our ceremony!",Positive,,,,,
Please make parking free for this staying at the hotel,Positive,,,,,
"Super impressive customer service and maid service. Our room was very clean, even the headboard was vacuumed.",Positive,,,,,
"My card statement did not match my bill. Apparently, there is a holding fee for each night. It would be helpful to know this when checking in.",Positive,,,,,
Should consider having a time for adult swim & hot tub.,Negative,,,,,
"The public areas of the hotel need some attention. The hallways were littered, did not appear to have been vacuumed for some time. The stairwells were pretty dark and dirty as well. Stairwells were used due to elevators being so slow.",Positive,,,,,
"Cash options in Store, bar and restaurant would be nice.",Positive,,,,,
Will definitely stay again and will recommend other to stay at this property as well.,Positive,,,,,
Hotel is due for refurbishment. It was better as an Embassy Suites.,Positive,,,,,
"I stayed in room 210 and this is the loudest room I have stayed in in a very long time.  The sliding door had just about zero noise insulation from the road, which was surprisingly busy and loud 24 hours a day.  This was a huge disappointment and made sleeping just about impossible without ear plugs.",Negative,,,,,
"Very pleasant, helpful staff. Was able to check-in early as Hyatt member. Staff recommended a great restaurant (based on dietary restrictions).",Positive,,,,,
Liked being able to select having no house cleaning.  Then could always use my room since it was close to the conference.,Positive,,,,,
I was disappointed that there was not a complimentary breakfast for the price we paid for the room. And the pet fee was extremely high.,Positive,,,,,
Housekeeping staff were great with room refresh and set but a deep cleaning is needed.,Positive,,,,,
Did not reflect the Hyatt brand well.,Positive,,,,,
The restaurant at this location has declined overall. The availability of food selections were very minimal and poor quality. There was no fish fry available on a Friday during lent. No kids options on any menu. The overall value was disappointing.,Negative,,,,,
I didn't like that the thermostat is not adjustable,Positive,,,,,
Parking not good had to wait for someone to leave to find place to park. 4 different times. No other options???  Will not stay there again.,Positive,,,,,
"The room itself was fine, but a little noisy being open to the lobby downstairs. The food at Pub33 was terrible and took a long time to come out (though it wasn't that busy when we were there). Worst sandwich I've ever had (sent it back), way overpriced, and what I received was NOT what the menu described.",Negative,,,,,
Fantastic!!!,Positive,,,,,
"Stocked Mini - Bars in some of the larger suites would be wonderful. Or just various items a few sodas, snacks. Sometimes things are forgotten to be grabbed on the way and you don't notice right away. Even with 24/7 access to such items in the lobby, going down 8 floors when you want a late snack is not always.",Positive,,,,,
Unfortunately we were there on a weekend with many children. Their behavior with running the halls to very late to early Am was annoying,Negative,,,,,
"The elevators were dirty, slow and a little scary. The bathrooms could use some updating. There were places where carpeting is puckering and created tripping hazards.",Negative,,,,,
"The wait time for the elevators seemed very long at all times, especially since there was no alternative way to get from floor to floor easily accessible.",Positive,,,,,
"Main lobby area tables were filthy. Wet carpet between bed and patio during rain event. Food was terrible in hotel restaurant. Soggy lunch sandwich, inedible fish, mushy overcooked rice and vegetables.",Negative,,,,,
"There wasn't a complementary breakfast served which would have been nice.  Also, the toilets were very low and anyone with knee or hip difficulty would not have been able to use it comfortably.",Positive,,,,,
I was so impressed with the young man that checked us inâ€” he was so polite and making sure that everything that we want or need was taken care of. And of course Samantha is always so attentive and nice.  That is why we love it at this hotel because they always make sure that we are totally taken are of.,Positive,,,,,
Restaurant price high,Neutral,,,,,
Love the front desk staff!  Kolten knows my name now when I check in and Samatha is always smiling in the morning when I leave for work!  Awesome staff,Positive,,,,,
"I'm 78 years old.  There was no grab bar in my bathtub.  That is highly unusual, and I was uncomfortable getting in and out of the tub to take my shower.",Negative,,,,,
It was so beautiful and I loved my room. Wished I could of stayed longer.,Positive,,,,,
"The hotel is in need of a face lift as many areas are worn & need to be replaced. The staff was helpful & pleasant. The elevators are slow and need maintenance. 
It is a 3 star hotel.",Positive,,,,,
I did not like that you have to pay for parking as a guest.,Positive,,,,,
It was awesome! We will book there again for sure!,Positive,,,,,
Front desk staff were nice to talk with and they started my trip on a bright start.,Positive,,,,,
"Unfortunately, the rooms are due for a much needed update. I had just come from the Hyatt Regency in Jacksonville where the rooms were much nicer and the staff was phenomenal, so the comparison was noticeable. The food at Pub33 was not good at all. I understand the need to have a limited menu when having so many people present for a large event, but the food and service was significantly lacking. I hate to provide such honest feedback that isnâ€™t positiveâ€¦ 

On the plus side, the front desk was very responsive when resolving an issue with the bill.",Positive,,,,,
Room could use some updating. They seem dated. Beds were comfortable. Room was clean.,Positive,,,,,
"I made a reservation in June not knowing if I would need 2 or 3 nights for my February stay.  Found out 2 weeks prior, I only need 2 so tried to cancel one night on Thursday and was told I would need to pay 40 more overall to cancel one night and when I said I could see charging me the same total for the 2 nights as 3 (in essence I pay the same whether I stay the 3 nights on my reservation or 2) but not more as I had a reservation for 3 nights and if I showed up Thursday it would be the quoted rate but because I can't check in until Friday I suddenly have to pay what I was paying for 3 nights(even though I'm now staying 2) plus 40 more when you can resell the Thursday night room besides.  The staff was rude, said rates were only going to ho up more and refused my request to speak with a manager to get clarification so I booked elsewhere.  Around 3 days later your rates went to 50 less per night than what my original reservation was for so I switched back only because my event was at your location but if the staff had been kind and honored my rate I would have paid you 50 more a night because I would have no reason to shop around an i would be happy.  I now feel like I was being scammed.
On a side note, the housekeepers were very friendly which is not something you see in many hotels.",Positive,,,,,
"Upon check in we found out that there was a dance competition that weekend which they were all very nice but young girls screaming in the lobby area until 1130-midnight is a bit much. We requested a ""quite room"" but we're given a room that was right on the main street with very loud vehicles driving by and right by the stairs with people going in and out all night all. Multiple issues with our room keys as well.",Positive,,,,,
bigest issue was the restaurant that was attached did not anticipate the big group that we brought in.,Positive,,,,,
The two young women in charge of the event were amazing. They were very helpful and kept coming back to see if I needed anything!,Positive,,,,,
The room temperature was overly warm. we opened the balcony door to cool it down,Positive,,,,,
"I sat on couch and  a liquid came in from below the cushion cover, and my rear end got wet",Positive,,,,,
Counter in room felt dirty and there was a cup between the couch and end table that should have been picked up!,Negative,,,,,
Toilet could have been bigger in the bathroom. The bowl is small for an adult.,Negative,,,,,
"by 5pm my room wasnt ready and i was told that i would be given a text message that it was available, i never received a text message. instead i had to go to the front desk again to see if my room was ready.",Positive,,,,,
It was a very nice stay. The staff were kind and helpful.,Positive,,,,,
"The hotel is just VERY OLD.  Bathroom was clean, but it was worn out.  Water pressure poor, hot water luke warm.  Elevators very slow, the decor very dated.  Needs major update.",Positive,,,,,
"I liked the electronic check in. 
Place was comfortable and modern.",Positive,,,,,
"I attended the Conference last year at the Hyatt, it was a good experience, I expected this year to be the same and it was. Thanks",Positive,,,,,
"The restaurant was not child friendly.  Being a hotel that was marketed as a ""family friendly"" establishment, I was disappointed that there was not a kids menu and a substitution/modification was provided with push back.",Negative,,,,,
Rooms had weird placement of the furniture in it. A bit outdated. The staff at check in and out was so professional and personable.,Negative,,,,,
"Overall great! Food was decent...chicken was dry and completely unseasoned. Minimal salad dressing, but they did bring more when asked. Other than that, everything was truly wonderful.",Positive,,,,,
The parking is very inconvenient.  Having to park across the street when non-paying clients took up parking stalls was not appreciated.,Positive,,,,,
"Love the room, it was fantastic.  Look forward to next trip",Positive,,,,,
We will definitely keep your hotel in mind if we travel to Green Bay in the future.,Positive,,,,,
Room only had 1 bath towel had to call for more towels and wash clothes.,Positive,,,,,
"Only difficulty was parking, but there was another large conference, so it was understandable.",Positive,,,,,
"We were in room 619 and felt there could be more light in the living area, it was fairly dark",Negative,,,,,
"We were in town for my sonâ€™s 4th surgery at Bellin hospital, told by surgery team stay at Hyatt they will honor a discount. No discount honored, told surgery team and they will not recommend hotel to future patients.",Positive,,,,,
We have been staying at this hotel for five years. This stay the highlight was the drastically improved pool conditions!! The lower temperature and less chlorine made swimming a much more enjoyable experience. It was the highlight of our stay.,Positive,,,,,
I have stayed here before with good service. Hairs in the shower and a shower that didn't drain were disappointing for the price of $140/night,Negative,,,,,
"Hotel staff was great, breakfast service was quite slow.",Positive,,,,,
Only had 1 water glass in room. That is not acceptable.,Positive,,,,,
"The lack of parking the first night was inconvenient, and I thought having someone in the area between the check in area and the elevators checking to see if I was a guest was sort of random.",Negative,,,,,
"Parking is not great
Larger vehicles do not fit in Parking structure.",Positive,,,,,
I have stayed once a year for a conference and I have had any problems and I have enjoyed my stay.,Positive,,,,,
Have a â€œreceptionâ€ from 9pm to 11 pm. Arborist conference.  Really ??  Drunks were loud until 1 am !!!  I was so pissed off makes me never want to stay at a Hyatt again â€¦.. in the middle of the atrium where sound carries very clearly and loudly itâ€™s inexcusable in my mind,Negative,,,,,
Great mgr,Positive,,,,,
Everyone was very nice and pleasant to talk to - I only had to talk to anyone at the front desk...,Positive,,,,,
Room is very dated. Crack in bathtub. Check in was not smooth. Booked party on separate floors. Had to downgrade to be near each other.,Negative,,,,,
"I have stayed here before and am overall happy with the experience. I have commented before on the woeful toilets, they are too low and too small for even the average person. Also the TV remotes are way outdated and once a person stumbles onto an analog channel, maintenance has to come up and solve the mystery.",Negative,,,,,
"Updates are definitely needed. Painted Wood in the bathroom has paint chipping.
Not what I would have expected from a Hyatt property.",Negative,,,,,
Only stayed for the night but as always the cleanliness and comfort is greatly appreciated,Positive,,,,,
A little chilly in convention center.,Positive,,,,,
"I used the gym and while it had everything that I needed to work out the machines were dirty.  I cleaned the machines before and after I used them, but they really needed to be cleaned.  I use a gym on a regular basis, and it is used by hundreds of people a day and they are cleaner than the machines in your hotel.  That includes the glass on the walls.",Negative,,,,,
The coffee was great. We didnâ€™t otherwise eat at the venue. We had a large group of college kids and the breakfast options were pricy,Positive,,,,,
Conference rooms were cold,Negative,,,,,
I'm 67 and everyone helped guide me so that my stay was very pleasant!,Positive,,,,,
"Beautiful hotel, the restaurants staff was amazing and attentive.",Positive,,,,,
"I did not like the restaurant in the hotel. It took over an hour and twenty minutes to get our food. When the food came, it was almost inedible. I would rather have gone to McDonald's. I feel frustrated even thinking about it.",Positive,,,,,
The bedroom could use more lighting.  It is very dark.,Positive,,,,,
"I was surprised by the parking fee. Only $10, but Inwas not aware.",Negative,,,,,
Rooms are very big,Positive,,,,,
The mattress on the sofa bed was horrible.  They need to be upgraded.,Positive,,,,,
I disliked the availability of stairs to the main/ common area. Food was good but not exceptional. Our room was immaculate/ very clean. Staff were kind and seemingly had strong work ethics. We did not need special accommodations but overheard requests from others and those were handled appropriately.,Positive,,,,,
The elevators didnâ€™t always go the direction that they said they were going and were super slow with how busy the hotel were.  My only complaint.,Positive,,,,,
Most Hyatts have a complimentary hot breakfast buffet with your stay. I was disappointed when there was not one. The elevators also need some work as they are very slow.,Positive,,,,,
"3rd year stay in a row- great hotel, front desk staff were awesome when we had to rebook for the snowstorm!",Positive,,,,,
I would definitely stay here again.  Check in was quick.  Rooms were spacious and clean.  Staff was friendly and helpful.,Positive,,,,,
"Quiet at night, nice bar. Warm room. Kitchen bar was great and loved bathroom mirror. Bed was great, but could of used an extra blanket
 The comforter was to narrow for a king sized bed.
,",Positive,,,,,
I've stayed in hotels hundreds of times and have never been treated with the care and professionalism of the staff from green bay Hyatt. And James was an absolutely amazing person! Thank you!,Positive,,,,,
As a rewards member I would have liked a late check out without payment.,Positive,,,,,
Anastasia is fantastic at the front desk and it was my birthday this time and Samantha and Jess made it very special for me and I truly appreciate these ladies even when we are there without it being a special occasion,Positive,,,,,
Your pub closed at 11:00 on a Friday night. You might want to think about keeping an open to at least midnight or 1:00 a.m. to serve your guests. This is the primary reason I am giving the Hyatt low marks,Positive,,,,,
Service was fine. Property is a little tired.,Negative,,,,,
"One thing to consider is an expedited breakfast for global members.  Many mornings I don't have 30+ minutes for breakfast, but I would grab something quick on the go if it were available.",Positive,,,,,
Special thanks to Cassianna for always getting my reservations done where I have never had an issue,Positive,,,,,
"Front desk is very polite and professional 
The locked down parking with a need to open the gate seems excessive when there is no event and like 6 cars in the lot!",Positive,,,,,
"I believe parking that is not covered or secure should not be charged.  I believe that breakfast should be included in my stay.  The food at the restaurant was mediocre, at best.  The restaurant staff was friendly, but the food is terrible.",Positive,,,,,
Night front desk staff was great in giving me a late checkout for the next day,Negative,,,,,
"Overall, a very nice hotel with a beautiful lobby and nice room rooms. However, both beds in the room were saggy and very uncomfortable. I tried both to see if the other one was maybe better than the first, but it was not. I was in room 714. Also, subpar water pressure for the shower. I would definitely hesitate before staying at this hotel again because the beds were so uncomfortable.",Negative,,,,,
several,Neutral,,,,,
The stay was wonderful except when I first entered the room and opened the sheer drapes to have quite a large spider drop down in front of my nose. I have quite a fear of these 8 legged creatures.  I proceeded to closely inspect the entire room.,Neutral,,,,,
Please change toilets they are very low had to fallo. To ita little scary.,Positive,,,,,
"The hotel is really dated. I did not like my corner King room at all. Television way too far from the bed. Bed coverings were so thin. It was like sleeping with a sheet. unfortunately, I chose a different hotel the next night.",Negative,,,,,
"I would like a refund for my $10 parking charge. I was not expecting this charge, as I was not charged during my previous stays here.",Positive,,,,,
Canâ€™t remember names but two women from sales and the front desk folks were phenomenal to work with.,Positive,,,,,
No additional feedback about the stay.,Positive,,,,,
"James, the manager deserves kudos for his helpfulness",Positive,,,,,
All I was offered was a roll-in- mattress for the broken bed,Negative,,,,,
The lobby was great. We just had to change our room because of cleanliness issue described earlier.,Positive,,,,,
I like your workout room. The hotel as a whole is about ready for a refresh in some areas. A in room safe would be nice. The coffee maker looked quite clean but the iron leaked water.,Positive,,,,,
"Really appreciate the recognition of my status and is the reason I continually choose Hyatt generally and this property specifically, for my frequent stays in GB.",Positive,,,,,
"Having traveled a ton, I was pleasantly surprised by the Hyatt Green Bay. Great stay and we will be back!",Positive,,,,,
I ate dinner twice in the Restaurant/Bar and the food was bad both times. The bartender was great though!,Positive,,,,,
Amazing hospitality at this hotel,Positive,,,,,
TV was a bit small and old but the worst part was the guide and having to go channel by channel to find out what you wanted to watch.,Positive,,,,,
Only issue was fridge door would not stay closed other than that loved everything! As soon as notified about fridge they were looking into it,Positive,,,,,
Free bfast would be nice.,Positive,,,,,
"The entire facility is super outdated.  Everything shows it age. Also, very poor overall planning. There is a mirror in the bedroom, but no nearby plug.  the only plug at that counter has no mirror. the bathroom has no exhaust fan. The rooms are very drafty and cold, even with the heat cranked. I had to use both comforters and my own personal blankets just to stay warm at night. No extra bedding provided for the sleeper sofa, or I would have used that blanket too.",Negative,,,,,
I really enjoyed my stay . Enjoyed it so much that I booked another stay for this upcoming March . The staff was absolutely amazing and the hotel is gorgeous . Best place I have ever stayed and will be my go to from here on out !,Positive,,,,,
James was great everyone is always so amazing when I come visit! This is my favorite place to stay especially room 808 itâ€™s my favorite,Positive,,,,,
The carpet in my room was all bubbled up. Kept tripping on it.,Negative,,,,,
"Our room was not up to the standard of a Hyatt hotel. The room itself was a corner room and was not like the other rooms in the Hyatt of Green Bay. ( 2 room set up). It was one big room with one couch, one desk chair, very little lighting, and the few pieces of furniture were worn, chipped, and mismatching.  We had difficulty getting on and off the toilet as it was so low. On the bright side, the beds were very comfortable,and the shower and towels were nice.  It was almost like the room we were in was an afterthought filled with mismatched furniture and odds and ends.  We will have a difficult time staying here again.",Positive,,,,,
The bathroom toilets are WAY to small and to low to the ground,Neutral,,,,,
"The staff deserves a raise. At the minimum, appreciation of what they do for their guests.",Positive,,,,,
Had to pay for my parking. No breakfast included.,Positive,,,,,
"This property . The Hyatt Regency Greenbay , needs a complete interior renovation to bring the interior finishes to current expectationsâ€¦ very disappointing..",Negative,,,,,
"Some parts of the room could stand upgrades. However, my opinion on that is mostly based on the high cost for a room during packer game day. Honestly I stay at hotels on business travel quite often and my service in GB was on par or better",Positive,,,,,
Friendly and helpful front desk staff. The corner suite was miserably cold due to the poorly insulated window. Made sleeping on the pullout couch very uncomfortable.,Negative,,,,,
"It is better than expected with the front desk and housekeeping, but the fact we pay per night to park and are not offered breakfast or coffee, we may not stay again.  Plus, anyone can get in from the street.  We felt very unsafe.",Positive,,,,,
"This hotel could use a remodel (was told it would be upgraded after the 2025 NFL Draft taking place in Green Bay).  But the staff was very welcoming, responded quickly to requests, and even allowed me to check in super early so that I could take business virtual meetings from my room.  The room did not have a hair dryer, but a brand new one was delivered to my room after I reached out to the front desk.",Positive,,,,,
"Hotel needs some upgrades around the facility. 
.i.e. restroom needs fan and update on fixtures etc.",Neutral,,,,,
Good location to the Meyer theater and places to eat.,Positive,,,,,
"Disappointed sauna was out of commission but enjoyed the steam rroom other than that everything was fine. there was 4 of us needed additional towels in room,  the pullout needs more support, and maybe additional items available at little corner store, like toiletries,  people forget stuff.",Positive,,,,,
4pm check in is quite late and we were rushed,Negative,,,,,
"Our room was really clean.  Sometimes when we travel with our dog, the â€œdog roomsâ€ are really gross.",Positive,,,,,
Front desk staff were very helpful! Looking forward to a 2nd stay!,Positive,,,,,
Itâ€™s just TOO far from the lobby to the ballrooms at the other end by river. Wearing heels for functions is nearly impossible of a walk. But no solution I can offer except a little wagon ride pulled by golf carts! ðŸ˜„. Not a fan of foodâ€” a bit cold. All in all it was a wonderful experience. Again your staff was remarkable.,Positive,,,,,
Hotel is getting old and worn down.   The elevators were horrible.,Negative,,,,,
It was a challenge to get an early check in. Eventually was able to but it took a lot of calling as my phone was not working.,Neutral,,,,,
There was no fan option on the thermometer and the room was very hot. There was a scary domestic incident two floors up from us and I didnâ€™t like that I had to pay $10 to park on top of my stay,Negative,,,,,
We didnâ€™t have hot water in our shower and it seemed itâ€™s been well known.  We had to move rooms after all situated.  The lobby staff did help get a new room with hot water.,Positive,,,,,
"Check in/out was easy. 
 No mattress in fold out couch. 
Very dusty room. 
No fault of hotel but a fist fight broke out at 1am and they were kicked out when police came. Noise from adjoining rooms was disrespectful",Negative,,,,,
"The parking was annoying. There needs to be a scan in and out pass given with the room key. 

I just press the need assistance button.",Positive,,,,,
"Always stay here when visiting family in the area and staff has always been kind, accommodating and a reason to return. $10 parking was a surprise and disappointingâ€¦ never had to put this before.",Positive,,,,,
