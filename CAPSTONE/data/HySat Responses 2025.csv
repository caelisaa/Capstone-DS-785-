2025-05-24 07:56:45] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good morning, Michael, 

My name is Kolton, and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager for the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. Thank you for taking time to complete feedback on your recent stay with us and thank you for being a World of Hyatt Discoverist. 

I am sorry to hear about the poor experience you had with out front desk staff member. Per World of Hyatt Policy, it is stated that 2 bottles of water per day is allotted for our Elite Guests. With that being said, when asked for additional, it is common practice to hand out more. I have reviewed with my colleague on this to ensure she knows going forward that the rule is flexible, and that the guidelines on the 2 bottles of water per day is not a steadfast requirement, and is flexible.

We do hope we can host you again in the future. 

Sincerely,

Kolton Madlem
Assistant Front Office Manager
Hyatt Regency- Green Bay

My name is Kolton, and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager for the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. Thank you for taking time to complete feedback on your recent stay with us, and thank you for being a World of Hyatt member. 

I am happy to hear that your stay went well overall! With that being said, I am sorry to hear about the continual issues with the toilet height, and lack of availability with an ADA guest room. We continue to investigate alternate solutions to help guests with having grab bars or an alternative placed in more of our rooms. We also have a renovation coming up which will increase our number of ADA rooms onsite. 

Thank you again for your feedback, and we look forward to hosting you again in the future.

My name is Kolton, and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager for the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. Thank you for taking time to complete feedback on your recent stay with us, and thank you for being a World of Hyatt Member. 

I am happy to hear overall your stay had gone well, outside the overflow parking situation, and the clogged shower drain. I have forwarded the concerns about the tub to our engineering team to investigate, and for the overflow parking, I will continue to work with my team to make it a more straightforward, and comfortable walk. 

Please feel free to reach out with any other concerns, and we hope to be able to host you in the future!
Sincerely,

Kolton Madlem

2025-05-19 04:32:03] Email received from: ""Burgener, Lisa"" <lburgener@gbp.com>: Good Morning Steven,
The Market was great - well stocked with a good variety.  Our conference had meals at the hotel so I'm not sure if they were catered in or supplied from hotel.  There were a couple meals that weren't that good.  Food was a bit overcooked and at times the buffet didn't seem to ""match"", but honestly that could be that I'm from a different part of the US and we may pair foods differently.  I appreciate you following up.
Best regard,

The Social (formerly Pub 333) Manager Minoj;The members of staff at the Hyatt Regency Hotel Green Bay, especially these seven mentioned earlier, were very welcoming, friendly, courteous and helpful from the moment that I walked into the hotel with my wife for our vacation to celebrate my milestone birthday and attend a church event in Green Bay.

I received complimentary birthday gifts including a beautiful birthday card, greetings, coffee and a $10 voucher to spend in the hotel's Market.

They gave me advice on the local services and attractions like nearby supermarkets, museum, restaurants, car hire services and even heated up my room when I complained that it was too cold. 

I enjoyed using their clean and functioning facilities like their gym, swimming pool, sauna and steam room. 

Needless to say that I thoroughly enjoyed myself and I did not want my 10-day vacation to end as I truly felt at home as the staff catered to all my needs and when spoilt me a lot. 

This is especially after my baggage was lost on my arrival to Green Bay Airport but later found and delivered to me at the hotel by Delta Airlines, who are in partnership with Hyatt Regency Hotel.

I would definitely recommend the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Green Bay, Wisconsin to anyone planning to stay in the area, as I'm already planning to return there myself.

This is also to say a BIG thank you to the amazing staff at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Green Bay, Wisconsin. You guys are the best. You're awesome! You rock!

Keep up your exceptionally great first-class service.

   My name is Steven Alves and I am the Food and Beverage Director here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I wanted to thank you for choosing us to stay with and for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. 
At Hyatt Regency we are here to provide authentic service exceeding guest expectations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. I do apologize that you had a poor dining experience with use. Not having dining options for you is unacceptable and to hear that the food that was ordered has sub-par just makes it worse. I have no excuses; however I will promise to work with my team to ensure an experience like yours never happens again. As a loyal WOH member I would like to offer you 1000 WOH points as a gesture that we appreciate your business and your feedback. Please let me know if you would like to share anything else with me. I hope next time you are in Green Bay you well give us another chance.

I am sorry to hear that your body wash was empty in your bathroom. We understand the importance of reliability of amenities being stocked, and we are sorry we fell short. I have forwarded this to our housekeeping team to ensure our inspectors are checking all dispensers are full prior to guests arrivals. With that being said, I'm glad to see the rest of your stay went well. 

If there is anything additional feedback you would like to provide, please feel free to reach out. We hope to be able to host you again in the future.

2025-05-26 02:22:28] Email received from: 85.neigh-undated@icloud.com: Dear Kolton,
Thank you for reaching out. I hope this message finds you well.
Overall, my recent stay was pleasant, and I appreciate the hospitality. However, I would like to bring a couple of issues to your attention:
Noise Disturbance in the Room: The room I stayed in was quite noisy throughout the night. There appeared to be a recurring mechanical sound, possibly from the air conditioning unit or another system, occurring every 15–20 minutes. Unfortunately, this significantly impacted my ability to sleep and made the stay less restful.
Missing Loyalty Points: I’ve also noticed that the stay points for this visit have not been credited to my loyalty account. It seems someone else may have received the points instead. My loyalty member number is 586718231W, and I would appreciate it if you could look into this matter and ensure the points are properly credited.
Please let me know if you need any additional information from my end to assist with the above.
Additionally, I’m planning a trip with my family around the June 6th weekend, and I would love to stay with you again. Once the above matters are resolved, I’d appreciate your help in making a new reservation.
Thank you for your attention to these matters. I look forward to hearing from you.
Best regards,
Dhyey Naik

My name is Kolton, and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager for the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. Thank you for being a World of Hyatt member, and thank you for taking time to complete feedback on your recent stay with us. 

Upon reviewing your reservation, I see that you had booked a Deluxe King Suite with Sofa Bed via Booking.com. These room types are one of our larger suite style rooms, but do not have a balcony attached to those. When booking in the future if you are looking for a balcony guest room, it is only our King Suite with Sofa Bed and Balcony. Those room types are guaranteed to have a balcony attached to the guest room. I do apologize for the confusion with this. 

If you have any further questions in regards to this, please let me know. 

Sincerely,

Kolton Madlem

At Hyatt Regency we are here to provide authentic service exceeding guest expectations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. It sounds like you had multiple unsatisfactory experiences in our restaurant. I do want to apologize for that as that is not the experience we want anyone to experience. Here at Hyatt our standards are much higher than you received, and I will use your feedback to work with the staff to retrain culinary of proper preparation. For your inconvenience I would like to offer you 1000 WOH points to be credited to your account and I hope it will be a small gesture in the hope you will try our establishment again next time you are in Green Bay.

At Hyatt Regency we are here to provide authentic service exceeding guest expectations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. I am happy to hear that you enjoyed your food, however hearing that you had long wait times at every meal period is unacceptable. I will be following up with both my kitchen staff and dining room staff to ensure retraining of expectations and time management. I hope if you are in Green Bay again soon you will choose to dine with us.

My name is Kolton and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager for the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. Thank you for taking time to complete feedback on your recent stay with us, and thank you for being a World of Hyatt member. We appreciate your feedback on your recent stay with us. 

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. I'm truly sorry to hear about the heating issue during your stay. I understand how difficult it must have been to keep your family comfortable, especially with the added challenge of managing two separate rooms and only one portable heater.

While I'm glad to know our staff were apologetic and supportive, I recognize that this situation was an inconvenience, and not the level of comfort we strive to provide. Please accept our sincerest apologies.

Your feedback has been shared with our maintenance team to ensure we address this issue more effectively moving forward. We value your comments as they help us improve.

If you choose to stay with us again, we’d love the opportunity to provide you with a much more comfortable experience. Please feel free to reach out to me directly so I can personally ensure your visit is a positive one.

Sincerely,

My name is Kolton, and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager for the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. Thank you for taking time to complete feedback on your recent stay with us, and thank you for being a World of Hyatt member. 

I’m sorry to hear about the issues you encountered with the carpet and the shower drain. That’s certainly not the experience we aim to provide. I’ve shared your comments with our maintenance team so they can address these problems promptly.

We're also in the process of planning some updates to the property, and feedback like yours is very helpful in guiding those improvements.

We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back again soon—and provide a more seamless stay.

My name is Kolton, and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. Thank you for taking time to complete feedback on your recent stay with us, and thank you for being a World of Hyatt member. 

We regret that the heating system did not properly warm your room—this is not the standard we aim to uphold, and we are having our maintenance team look into the issue immediately. We also apologize for the lack of in-room coffee supplies and the condition of the furniture. These are details we should not have overlooked, and we are taking steps to ensure that our housekeeping and maintenance standards are reinforced.

Your concerns are being shared with our team so we can make the necessary improvements. We truly value your feedback and hope to have the opportunity to better serve you in the future. 
Sincerely,

Kolton Madlem

food and beverage a good rating, I think I was just upset about some of the
hotel room issues.
We had 2 meals in the restaurant, 1 breakfast and 1 dinner.  Both meals
were very high quality , the food was excellent.  Even more memorable was
the servers. Both times our service was above and beyond expectations.
Thank you again for reaching out.

When I checked out yesterday my tax was still on my room bill.  I reached
out later and spoke with Melody who told me something about a form. I am
confused as I provided the tax exempt form upon check-in.  Do I need to
complete another form?

I think I filled this out wishing there was more than just coffee offered for the breakfast at the hotel in case you didn't want to purchase market items.  The items were good from the market and their quality was good too, so it had nothing to do with that.  I'm pretty sure that was all I was thinking when I filled out the survey.
Thanks so much,
Amanda

My name is Kolton, and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager for the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. Thank you for taking time to complete feedback on your recent stay with us, and thank you for being a World of Hyatt member. 

We are sorry to hear about the issues you encountered during your stay with us from the television in your room, to the difficulties with the guest room phone. I will pass along the concerns to our engineering team to review. As for the guest rooms themselves, you will be happy to hear that we are going to be completing full property renovations slated to start in the latter half of 2025. They are expected to be fully completed by 2028. 

I am glad to see overall the rest of your stay went well with staff interactions.

Actually the stay was great, I wasn’t able to taste any food or drinks, but I know the man working bartending was a little bit unwelcoming. He was doing his job, but he almost felt dismissive or seemed like he couldn’t handle a few people at the bar. It almost felt like we were a burden on him instead of him happy to be there or even happy to have us as guest there.

2025-04-08 15:18:22] Email received from: Kathleen  Chai <ktc1@cox.net>: On the first morning I ordered breakfast.  It took quite awhile and I had asked for the bacon to be crispy.  It was thin and flubbery.  That night I asked for fish and chips and was told they were out.  I picked a Rueben pannini.  It was inedible.  It was on 2 slices of white bread, barely toasted, a very, very thin portion of corned beef, about a teaspoon of sauerkraut with minimal dressing.  I ate the fries and the waiteress did not charge me for the sandwich.  On the next morning I ordered breakfast and it took over 40 minutes to get there.  The food manager came and apologized.  The corned beef has was a few pieces of overcooked shredded corned beef with few potatoes or onions.  For a hotel with this name, I was very surprised and being on a business trip did not have time to follow up.  Kathy Chai

My name is Kolton, and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager for the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. 

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback, and I sincerely apologize for the issues you experienced during your recent stay. We understand how disappointing it can be when a stay does not meet your expectations, especially when it’s a place you’ve enjoyed before. I’m truly sorry for the inconveniences you encountered.

Regarding the breakfast, I apologize for the misunderstanding. While we’ve made changes to our breakfast offerings for certain membership levels, we certainly understand how important this is for families. Your comments will help us ensure better communication about these changes moving forward. If you can forward where you saw that breakfast was included with your room, it would be greatly appreciated so we can get this updated to not cause further confusion. 

I’m also very sorry for the issues with the air conditioning and the toilet in your room. This is definitely not the standard we aim to provide. Our maintenance team will be investigating the room to ensure everything is in proper working order.

Your feedback is valuable to us, and I can assure you that we will be addressing these issues to improve the experience for future guests. If you’re open to it, we’d love to have the opportunity to make things right. Please feel free to reach out to me directly, and improve your stays in the future. 

Again, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and hope we have the opportunity to welcome you back in the future.

I do see where the confusion came from on Priceline's website on the type of breakfast offered, though all breakfast options on property are for a fee. I do see for other hotels that have complimentary breakfast included with the stay outlined on the main page for selecting the hotels on Priceline.com. I do apologize again for the confusion. 

Due to the toilet issue, and heating issue, I would like to extend 4,000 World of Hyatt Bonus points to your account. Please confirm if you would like these applied to your account, and I will be happy to do so.

2025-04-07 08:32:34] Email received from: ""Olson, Lisa"" <Lisa.Olson@SevitaHealth.com>: Hi Steven,
I appreciate you reaching out.  I do want to share that the quality of the food was not of concern.  It was presented well and tasted amazing.  I was a bit frustrated though that I waited for about 15 minutes for the yogurt to be refilled and actually had to tell the server it was out.  Once it came, I grabbed utensils and went to my seat, only to find that there wasn't a spoon in the rolled up utensils.  Upon returning to the buffet, I shared with a server that I needed a spoon, they handed me another rolled up utensil pack, but I told them there wasn't spoons in there.  They insisted there was and actually unrolled a set to prove it to me.  I think they felt a bit silly when they saw that indeed, there wasn't a spoon.  I was one of the last ones that went through the line, so I anticipate that others gave up and ate with a fork.  Two people said they would get me a spoon, but again - this took quite a while to retrieve.  Perhaps not a huge issue, but an area for improvement in the prep.
With you being in charge of food/beverages, I do want to share that my biggest concern was with the condition of the hotel room itself, items left behind by a previous guest that led me to have concerns, especially after seeing the amount of dust behind the side table when I dropped my cell phone in between the bed/side table.
I never complain or give negative feedback, but given other peers that also stayed had issues, I felt you would want the feedback.
Lisa

At Hyatt Regency we are here to provide authentic service exceeding guest expectations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. I apologize for the long waits in our restaurant. I believe I may have spoken to you on sight during breakfast. We have no excuses just that it is unacceptable, and we will continue to improve our efforts for our guests. As a loyal WOH member I would like to add 2000 points to your account for the issues in our establishment.  I hope that you will accept these points from us and next time you are in Green Bay you will stay with us again.

Thank you for sharing your feedback. We deeply apologize for the inconveniences you experienced during your stay. We truly understand your frustration, and we appreciate you taking the time to provide specific details about your experience.

It’s clear we fell short in a few areas, including the room assignment delays, the missing blanket for the pull-out couch, and the wait times for pool towels. These are all matters we take seriously, and we are addressing them with our team to ensure they don’t happen again.

We are also sorry for the lack of immediate acknowledgment and apologies at the front desk when you arrived. Your time is valuable, and we should have handled your situation more efficiently and with greater empathy.

We appreciate your patience and understanding, especially considering the busy convention period, but please know we are committed to improving these aspects of our service.

Thank you again for bringing these matters to our attention. We hope to have the opportunity to provide you with a more seamless experience in the future.

Thank you for your reply. I did mention it to the front desk but the lady
had a horrible attitude and seemed like she didn’t care. However did
mention it to the lady that was there the next morning and she was
wonderful. Things go out I totally understand that I just didn’t appreciate
the attitude. Also I show the $50 deposit they said would return back to me
as still pending can you verify if that will be getting returned.

I do apologize for the poor experience you had with one of our agents, and will have a review session on how to handle guest interactions with the team overall. That is certainly not the appropriate response on an issue.  

As for the incidental hold, we release that at check-out. Depending on your banking institution, it normally takes 3-5 business days for them to release that back to your card. If it is still there after 5 business days, please reach out to them to see the reason for the delay. 

Sincerely,

   My name is Steven Alves and I am the Food and Beverage Director here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I wanted to thank you for choosing us to stay with and for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. 
At Hyatt Regency we are here to provide authentic service exceeding guest expectations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. I appreciate your honest feedback on your dining experience. I have no excuses for you, all I can do is apologize and use this experience to better prepare and train my team so experiences like yours don't happen again. I see you have frequented our establishment, and I hope next time you are in Green Bay you will give us another chance. As a loyal World of Hyatt member I would like to offer you 2000 WOH points to be credited to your account for your poor experience in our outlet. I hope that will go a little way in showing you that we truly honor our guests and would love to have you back.

Hi Kolton
Thank you for reaching out, I appreciate your note.  My room was 704, I have stayed at your hotel a couple of times but I don’t remember having trouble with the bed before.  Perhaps it is something with that room. The bed felt lumpy and uncomfortable.
I will be returning to Greenbay in a couple of weeks, I look forward to staying at the Hyatt again
Good night

I am happy to see you had a great stay with us overall, outside a less than ideal check-in experience.

My name is Kolton, and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager for the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. 

Thank you for taking time to complete feedback on your recent stay, and thank you for being a World of Hyatt member. 

I am sorry to hear about the issues you encountered with your first guest room, but am happy to hear this was remedied with the second guest room. I will ensure to pass alone the cleanliness feedback to our housekeeping team to review. 

As for the overall state of the guest rooms, we are going to be completing a full property renovation starting in the latter half of 2025 and set to be completed by roughly 2028. 

If there is anything we can do to make up for the issues encountered during your stay, please let us know. 

I hope to hear from you soon.

We are happy to see service we did well for your stay with us, but are sorry we fell short with the overall condition of the property. We have a full property renovation slated to begin in the latter half of 2025, and set to be completed by 2028. 

We hope we will be able to host you again in the future once these improvements are completed.

My name is Kolton, and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager here for the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. Thank you for taking time to complete feedback on your recent stay with us, and thank you for being a World of Hyatt member. 

I wanted to reach out in regards to your poor stay with us. I am sorry to hear about the cleanliness issues you encountered with your guest room, as well as the issues you had with the room type change without being advised. The reason for the room type change occurred was due to an room inventory shortage that occurred, and I do apologize that was not communicated at the point of check-in. 

As far as it goes for the room cleanliness issues that did occur, please let me know if there is anything I can do to try and rectify your poor experience.

I hope to hear from you soon.

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us. I want to sincerely apologize for the issue you encountered with the cleanliness of your room. Finding an empty liquor bottle is completely unacceptable, and I deeply regret that we did not meet our high standards during your stay. 

Please know that I take this matter very seriously. I will be addressing it with both the housekeeper and the inspector responsible for your room to ensure this does not happen again. If you could provide a bit more detail on where the bottle waws located, it would help us better understand how this was overlooked and take the necessary corrective actions. 

Additionally, I would love the opportunity to make this right for you. Please let me know how I can do so, and I truly appreciate your patience and understanding. Your experience is very important to us, and I hope we have the chance to welcome you back for a much-improved stay.

 (6276365)",,2,Wouldn’t recommend (especially if you’re a WOH globalist or above member),"Our stay was extremely subpar. The only pro to our stay was the indoor pool area. 

Here were the cons: 
I spent 20 min for th check-in process. They did not honor the expedited check-in line for WOH Discoverist, Explorist & Globalist members. When I finally was helped, they acted like they didn’t have two separate line sections & that it was my fault for not falling into the main line. 

Elevators are extremely slow. The only reason we didn’t take the stairs because it was so far from the elevator area & we stayed on the 8th floor. You may think it’s a silly thing to write about but if you stay there, you’ll see it truly is a nuisance.

The thermostat does not allow for any personalization. The fan blew all night, making it such a dry environment. My children & I left with sniffles because of it. It seems as if the facility is pretty outdated. Carpets were in poor condition. Popcorn ceiling in full effect —how is that still a thing in the luxury hotels? 

The worst thing is that the noise level at night is extremely disruptive. Close to 11 PM, there were drag races occurring outside. It made it difficult to put my young kids down, let alone settle in myself. When I contacted the front desk that evening, they offered to switch our room &/or send up ear plugs (which was super accommodating, I will acknowledge). In the morning, when I went to get my two free water bottles of the day, the attendant asked how my night went. I mentioned the noise level, & she said that it is a regular occurrence, and that I should call the non-emergent Green Bay Police department, if it were to happen that following evening. It seems silly to put that responsibility on the customer. The front desk should call Green Bay PD themselves.

We stayed at this Hyatt as a stay-cation but don’t think we will return. For close to 20k points redemption, it was not worth it. I had high hopes for this Hyatt Regency but you’re better off using points for other Hyatts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Received,,Did not receive,Did not receive,Did not receive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,53,,Post-Stay Survey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,10,,,,"The thermostat in the room was not functioning.

Thank you for reaching out regarding my recent stay at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.
I wanted to follow up, as I called and left a voicemail for you on Wednesday, March 26th at 2:07 p.m., and again yesterday, Thursday, March 27th at 4:13 p.m. Unfortunately, I have not received a return call.
Your lack of response is, unfortunately, beginning to feel consistent with the less-than-ideal experience we had while staying in Room 827 over the weekend. I had hoped to speak with you to resolve the matter directly, but the continued lack of communication is disappointing.
Please let me know if and when you are available to discuss further.

Thank you for your email. I appreciate you reaching out and giving me the
opportunity to provide additional feedback regarding my recent experience
at your food and beverage outlets.
While I appreciate the chance to share my thoughts, I must admit that I was
quite disappointed with several aspects of my dining experience. The wait
time for the food was longer than necessary, and the salad I ordered looked
unprofessional, as if it had been prepared carelessly. Additionally, the
dressing was sparse. Furthermore, both the appetizer and steak were
excessively salty, and the meat tasted as though it was starting to spoil.
I rarely complain about food, but this experience was subpar. As a result,
I chose to purchase pastries from Walmart for the remainder of my stay.
I hope this feedback is helpful. I trust that you can address these issues
and improve the quality of your food and service. I look forward to the
possibility of trying your service again in the future and having a more
positive experience.
Sincerely,
Felix Ogunmokun, Ph.D

My name is Kolton, and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. Thank you for taking time to complete feedback on your recent stay with us, and thank you for being a World of Hyatt Member.

I am sorry to hear that you had issues with noise with your guest room during your stay with us. I understand the importance of a tranquil guest room during your stay, and am sorry we fell short. I have added a note to your profile for future stays, to have you placed in a guest room away from the main road to help you have a more restful stay. 

As for the microwavable dishes, I am sorry that none were offered to you. Our Pub onsite would have been happy to lent you a bowl or plate if needed for your room during your stay with us. 

If there is anything I can do to right the issues with your stay, please let me know by either replying to this email, or calling me at (920) 432-1234 Ext. 4233. 

I hope to hear from you soon.

My name is Kolton, and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I wanted to thank you for being a World of Hyatt Member, and for taking time to complete feedback on your recent stay with us. 

I am sorry to hear about how uncomfortable the room was during your stay due to the heat, and outside road noise. We understand the importance of a restful nights sleep, and are sorry we could not deliver. That is not the kind of experience we want our guests to have. 

With that being said, I want to try and make this right for you. 

When you have a moment, please either call me at (920) 432-1234 Ext. 4233, or reply to this email on what I can do to make things right. 

I hope to hear from you soon.

At Hyatt Regency we are here to provide authentic service exceeding guest expectations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. I deeply apologize for how you were treated in our Market. This is unacceptable and I will be looking into this. I will also share with our chef your comments and feedback about your dining experience in our Pub. We take guests feedback very seriously and will use it to continue to improve for our guests. I hope next time you are in town you will give Hyatt Regency Green Bay another try.

Points expire after 24 months of no travel with your account. So as long as you have your membership attached to at least 1 stay within Hyatt during a 24 month period, the points should remain active. 

I am submitting the points request tonight, so you should see it on your account within 7-10 business days.

My name is Kolton, and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assist us in improving our overall guest experience.  

 We here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in not only meeting but exceeding our guests' expectations, however based on your response we have some room for improvement. I do apologize that your experience was impacted by the cold water in the shower for Thursday during your stay, as well as the loose toilet in your room. I have passed this along to our engineering team to complete these repairs. Due to the issues you did have, I am extending 3,000 World of Hyatt bonus points to your account. Please confirm that it is okay for me to do so, and I will get it completed. I will also pass along the feedback for the coffee cups. 

 If there is any additional feedback in regard to how we can exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly.  

Once again, thank you for your response and don't hesitate to let me know if there is anything further that I can do for you.

 My name is Kolton, and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I'd like to extend my sincere gratitude to you for choosing our hotel for your recent stay.  

We here at Hyatt truly strive to care for people so they can be their best. I am so grateful that you took the time to complete our post-stay survey as your feedback assists us in ensuring the needs and desires of all of our guests are not only met but exceeded. I'm thrilled to see you had an overall great experience; however, based on your responses it seems there may be some room for improvement in a few areas. I sincerely apologize that you were uncomfortable with the bathrooms in our rooms, as they did not have grab bars in the shower. We want to ensure a comfortable and safe stay for our guests, and I am sorry we fell short with this. I had added notes to your profile with your World of Hyatt membership on your preference of guest rooms with grab bars in the shower. Please note, if we do not have a room with permanent grab bars available during your stay, we do have temporary bars that are able to be installed in your bathroom to help with getting into and out of the shower. Simply let the front desk know at check-in and we will be happy to get this installed for your room during your stay. 

 If there are any additional thoughts or feedback you have that you would like to share, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly. Otherwise, thanks again for your response, safe travels and I look forward to welcoming you back to Green Bay in the future! 

Sincerely,
Kolton Madlem

My name is Kolton, and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assist us in improving our overall guest experience.  

 We here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in not only meeting but exceeding our guests' expectations, however based on your response we have some room for improvement. I do apologize that your experience was impacted by the reservation portion of your stay. For clarification, I show the original 3 night reservation you had booked with us was $137.08 per night, plus tax for staying with us. Then when the reservation was updated on 02/22/2025, I show the rate for the 2 night stay being $160 plus tax for Friday (02/28) and $165 plus tax for Saturday (03/01). While reviewing the reservation notes, it shows that the changes were processed by the Central Call Center for Hyatt, and not on property. I do apologize for the issues they have caused you for your reservation, and as a one time courtesy, I am going to honor the rate of $137.08 for each night. I have completed the rate adjustment and submitted the refund request on your behalf. You should see this back on your card within 3 to 5 business days. I have also emailed you the updated receipt reflecting this refund. 

 If there is any additional feedback in regard to how we can exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly.  

Once again, thank you for your response and don't hesitate to let me know if there is anything further that I can do for you.

To cancel one night, I was told the rate changed to over 450 for 2 nights so around 225 per night.  I was just asking to at least keep the 411 total for 2 nights since I already had a reservation for 411 for 3 nights.  (I worked almost 20 years in hotel sales and know rates change but my request was very fair considering the Thursday could be resold and revenue would not be decreasing).  I rebooked to the new rate online for the 167 price later when i went to cancel the original booking.  I do thank you for reaching out and making this right.  I will stay again based on your customer service and as I mentioned in the survey, your housekeeping staff was so friendly!

My name is Kolton, and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assist us in improving our overall guest experience.  
 We here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in not only meeting but exceeding our guests' expectations, however based on your response we have some room for improvement. I do apologize that your experience was impacted by the reservation portion of your stay. For clarification, I show the original 3 night reservation you had booked with us was $137.08 per night, plus tax for staying with us. Then when the reservation was updated on 02/22/2025, I show the rate for the 2 night stay being $160 plus tax for Friday (02/28) and $165 plus tax for Saturday (03/01). While reviewing the reservation notes, it shows that the changes were processed by the Central Call Center for Hyatt, and not on property. I do apologize for the issues they have caused you for your reservation, and as a one time courtesy, I am going to honor the rate of $137.08 for each night. I have completed the rate adjustment and submitted the refund request on your behalf. You should see this back on your card within 3 to 5 business days. I have also emailed you the updated receipt reflecting this refund. 
 If there is any additional feedback in regard to how we can exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly.  
Once again, thank you for your response and don't hesitate to let me know if there is anything further that I can do for you.

Sunday night we came in and sat down to eat. It took a long time to get someone to give us service. 
Monday morning we came done for breakfast and it took the server time to get to us. I watched multiple people that left because the wait was too long. It looked like to me you were understaffed for the group of guest you had come in.
This is something to help you.
When the food came it was really good.

My name is Kolton, and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I'd like to extend my sincere gratitude to you for choosing our hotel for your recent stay.  

We here at Hyatt truly strive to care for people so they can be their best. I am so grateful that you took the time to complete our post-stay survey as your feedback assists us in ensuring the needs and desires of all of our guests are not only met but exceeded. I'm thrilled to see you had an overall great experience; however, based on your responses it seems there may be some room for improvement in a few areas. I sincerely apologize that there were issues with the fridge door not being able to open and close properly. I have submitted a maintenance request for them to review and get that fixed. Please note in the future, if you do experience any issues like that at all, please let us know, and we will be happy to have someone check on it immediately. 

If there are any additional thoughts or feedback you have that you would like to share, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly. Otherwise, thanks again for your response, safe travels and I look forward to welcoming you back to Green Bay in the future! 

Sincerely,

Kolton Madlem

2025-02-26 03:51:13] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good morning, John, 

 My name is Kolton, and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assist us in improving our overall guest experience.  

 We here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in not only meeting but exceeding our guests' expectations, however based on your response we have some room for improvement. I do apologize that your experience was impacted by our bathroom fan not working properly, and the parking lot being full from non-guests of our property. For the fan, I will pass this along to our engineering team to ensure that the fan is repaired. As for the parking lot, we are working on ways to mitigate non-guests parking in our lot. We do apologize you had to park across the street in the parking ramp during your stay. 

 If there is any additional feedback in regard to how we can exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly.  

 Once again, thank you for your response and don't hesitate to let me know if there is anything further that I can do for you.  

Sincerely,
Kolton Madlem
Assistant Front Office Manager
Hyatt Regency- Green Bay

 My name is Kolton, and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I'd like to extend my sincere gratitude to you for choosing our hotel for your recent stay.  

 We here at Hyatt truly strive to care for people so they can be their best. I am so grateful that you took the time to complete our post-stay survey as your feedback assists us in ensuring the needs and desires of all of our guests are not only met but exceeded. I'm thrilled to see you had an overall great experience; however, based on your responses it seems there may be some room for improvement in a few areas. I sincerely apologize that the heating system was giving you issues during your stay with us. We strive to provide a comfortable experience for our guests, and I am sorry we feel short on this. 

If there are any additional thoughts or feedback you have that you would like to share, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly. Otherwise, thanks again for your response, safe travels and I look forward to welcoming you back to Green Bay in the future! 

Sincerely,
Kolton Madlem
Assistant Front Office Manager

My name is Kolton, and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I'd like to extend my sincere gratitude to you for choosing our hotel for your recent stay.  

 

We here at Hyatt truly strive to care for people so they can be their best. I am so grateful that you took the time to complete our post-stay survey as your feedback assists us in ensuring the needs and desires of all of our guests are not only met but exceeded. I'm thrilled to see you had an overall great experience; however, based on your responses it seems there may be some room for improvement in a few areas. I sincerely apologize that  there were issues with the refrigerator in your guest and the heat in your room. I am glad to hear we were able to get these issues addressed for you during your stay. 

If there are any additional thoughts or feedback you have that you would like to share, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly. Otherwise, thanks again for your response, safe travels and I look forward to welcoming you back to Green Bay in the future! 
Sincerely,

able to type very well.
When eating breakfast at Pub 333 we found the prices very high and the
bacon was burned.  The staff was very friendly and helpful but the prices
and quality of food was not the best.
I hope this was helpful.

2025-02-12 15:05:14] Email received from: kathy leatherberry <kathylea1950@gmail.com>: Hello. In answer to your reply. I found the lamp on the end of the sofa did
not work. Also the quilt on our king size bdd was not as wide as it should
be. Also an extra blanket would of been nice, as the 2 sheets and the quilt
are not warm enough for wisconsin winters. We were pulling the quilt from
one side to the other just to be warm. Pillows were great and the room was
very nice. A better menu in restuarant would be better with more, regular
food without all the added, so called fancy stuff . Not everyone cares for
that vegetarion types of food. Kids in particular could not find much of
what they like. This is steak and usual restuarant  country up north in
Green Bay. Most people were going else where too eat
Drinks were great , but highly priced. We enjoyed our time there and its a
beautiful place. We will be back, but may have to bring an extra blanket
and extrs food. We will not be dining there. The lady that checked us in
was great and very helpful.

We had very positive interactions with all of the Hyatt team members.  In addition we thought that the food was excellent.  The only shortfall was the facility itself.  The hotel needs a total physical makeover.  The toilet in the bathroom looks like it should be in a grade scool or pre-school bathroom - I've never seen a toilet that small.

When checking into Hyatt Regency Green Bay, we place a temporary authorization of $50 per night on your credit or debit card. This hold covers any incidental charges you may incur during your stay, such as dining, parking or the event damages are found to the room. This is not an actual charge-- any unused portion of the authorization is released after checkout. However, the timing of the release depends on your bank's processing time, which may take a few business days.  The total amount charged for your stay was $197.51 and should balance out within a few days. You can reach out to your banking institution for a better understanding of a timeline. If there are any other questions please let me know. Did you want to go forward with the 3000 World of Hyatt points? If you could let me then I can go forward with that process so you'd be able to see those points within 3-5 business days.


Sincerely,

Jess Stewart

My name is Kolton, and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I'd like to extend my sincere gratitude to you for choosing our hotel for your recent stay.  

We here at Hyatt truly strive to care for people so they can be their best. I am so grateful that you took the time to complete our post-stay survey as your feedback assists us in ensuring the needs and desires of all of our guests are not only met but exceeded. I'm thrilled to see you had an overall great experience; however, based on your responses it seems there may be some room for improvement in a few areas. I sincerely apologize that there were issues with your heating system in your guest room during your stay. I understand the importance of having a cooler room to sleep comfortably, and I am sorry we fell short in delivering that. Please note, if you stay with us in the future, do not hesitate to reach out to the front desk for any issues, and we will be happy to have our onsite engineering investigate the issue. 

 If there are any additional thoughts or feedback you have that you would like to share, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly. Otherwise, thanks again for your response, safe travels and I look forward to welcoming you back to Green Bay in the future! 
Sincerely,

My name is Kolton Madlem, and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I'd like to extend my sincere gratitude to you for choosing our hotel for your recent stay. 

We here at Hyatt truly strive to care for people so they can be their best. I am so grateful that you took the time to complete our post-stay survey and thrilled to see you had an overall great experience! We appreciate all of the feedback we can get as it assists us in ensuring the needs and desires of all of our guests are not only met but exceeded. That said, we do completely understand the need for some updates throughout the property and are working diligently to get the ball rolling on a number of improvements! We appreciate your feedback nonetheless, though, as it assists us in noting areas to prioritize in future renovations.  I also apologize for the issues with the iron in your guest room, and hope no staining occurred to your clothing. 

If there are any additional thoughts or feedback you have that you would like to share, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly. Otherwise, thanks again for your response, safe travels and I look forward to welcoming you back to Green Bay in the future! 
Sincerely,

Kolton Madlem

My name is Kolton Madlem, and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I'd like to extend my sincere gratitude to you for choosing our hotel for your recent stay.  

We here at Hyatt truly strive to care for people so they can be their best. I am so grateful that you took the time to complete our post-stay survey as your feedback assists us in ensuring the needs and desires of all of our guests are not only met but exceeded. I'm thrilled to see you had an overall great experience; however, based on your responses it seems there may be some room for improvement in a few areas. I sincerely apologize that you had poor experience with your meals here. We strive to provide guests a great dining experience, and we are sorry we fell short both times. If you could please advise of what went poorly with your food, we would be happy to pass this onto our food and beverage department. 

  If there are any additional thoughts or feedback you have that you would like to share, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly. Otherwise, thanks again for your response, safe travels and I look forward to welcoming you back to Green Bay in the future!

My name is Kolton Madlem, and I am the Assistant Front Office Manager here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I'd like to extend my sincere gratitude to you for choosing our hotel for your recent stay.  

We here at Hyatt truly strive to care for people so they can be their best. I am so grateful that you took the time to complete our post-stay survey as your feedback assists us in ensuring the needs and desires of all of our guests are not only met but exceeded. I'm thrilled to see you had an overall great experience; however, based on your responses it seems there may be some room for improvement in a few areas. I sincerely apologize that you had a poor experience in our restaurant for breakfast during your stay. We strive to provide guest satisfaction all around, and we are sorry we fell short. With that being said, I did go ahead and adjust off your market charges that were on your room, as you paid separately for your biscuits and gravy. You will receive an updated receipt reflecting this change, and the refund. Please allow 3 to 5 business days for the refund to reflect on your card. 

If there are any additional thoughts or feedback you have that you would like to share, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly. Otherwise, thanks again for your response, safe travels and I look forward to welcoming you back to Green Bay in the future! 

Sincerely,

Kolton Madlem

2025-01-10 13:19:04] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good afternoon Ashley,

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Breton Spiller, and I am the Guest Experience Specialist here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I want to thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us. Your comments are invaluable in helping us improve the overall guest experience at our property.

We take great pride in meeting and exceeding our guests' expectations, and I sincerely apologize that your experience did not reflect that standard. I’m truly sorry for the cleanliness issue you encountered with the comforter. This is certainly not the level of cleanliness we strive for, and I understand how concerning this must have been. Occasionally, our blankets may show rust stains from being used on the sofa beds/getting caught in the metal pieces, but this is not typical, and we are actively working to address it. While I cannot say for certain what the stain on your comforter was from, I just wanted to acknowledge the possibility. Regardless, we will certainly follow up with our housekeeping and laundry teams to ensure more care and attention detail is present when preparing linens for our rooms. 

I would also like to clarify that our front desk team did offer to move you to another room and to have housekeeping come up immediately to inspect and resolve the issue, but I understand you chose not to take us up on that offer. Please know that we would have gladly taken the opportunity to address this matter during your stay, though I do apologize if this was not made clear.

That said, I would like to, as an act of good will and a supplement to our sincerest apologies for the cleanliness issues, offer you 5,000 points awarded to your World of Hyatt membership account. These would be able to be utilized towards a free stay or other on-site amenities at any Hyatt property. Let me know if you'd like to move forward with that and I'll get those submitted for you right away.

If there is any additional feedback or suggestions on how we can exceed your expectations in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me directly. Once again, thank you for sharing your experience, and I hope we can have the opportunity to provide you with a much better stay in the future.

Sincerely,

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Breton Spiller, and I am the Guest Experience Specialist here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I want to thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us. Your comments are invaluable in helping us improve the overall guest experience at our property.

We take great pride in meeting and exceeding our guests' expectations, and I’m glad to hear that our front desk and housekeeping teams met your needs. However, I do apologize that your experience with some other aspects of your stay fell short.

Regarding parking, I understand that paying a nightly fee can be frustrating, however, this fee helps us maintain and secure our parking facilities. If you prefer to park elsewhere in the future, though, we do have a parking ramp connected to our hotel via skywalk that is free on weekdays after 6pm (until 6am), weekends, and holidays! Additionally, we do offer complimentary coffee in our guest rooms as well as daily in our atrium from 6am to 11am, though I do apologize if you were unaware of this during your recent stay.

I also understand your concerns about safety. Please be assured that we have 24/7 security monitoring the property to ensure the safety of all our guests. I will make sure your concerns are shared with our security team for further review.

In terms of your dining experience, I apologize for the menu limitations and issues with drink preparation. We are currently working on updating our menu, and I’ll be sure to pass your feedback along to our restaurant team so they can take it into consideration as we work to improve the overall guest experience. We will also be sure to work with our staff on some re-training surrounding the preparation of beverages.

If there is any additional feedback or suggestions on how we can exceed your expectations in the future, or anything further that I can do for you, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me directly. Once again, thank you for sharing your experience, and I hope we can have the opportunity to provide you with a much better stay in the future.

That said, while we do not have fire sticks or fully functional smart TVs with Netflix in the rooms, all of our TVs should have the ability to be casted to from your personal device. If you download the World of Hyatt app, there will be instructions on how to utilize this feature on there - you can also contact our on-site team for assistance with this at any time! I hope we can get you set up with that in the future so you can truly enjoy every part of our hotel's experience. 

Very glad to hear that our team had such a positive impact on your stay, though! I'll be sure to pass the recognition along.

2025-01-09 09:42:58] Email received from: Shannon Jackson <smjack0920@yahoo.com>: Thank you so much for responding that truly says that the customer experience really means something and that's greatly appreciated. With that being said we literally was looking for a different hotel (very reluctant) for our anniversary weekend on the 24th of January. Just for this small feature because like I said we was pleased with everything else. And now because of this email we can download the app and go with the hotel we know for sure we originally wanted to stay for our anniversary weekend. So thank you so much for responding just goes to show the great customer service you guys continue to give.

My name is Breton Spiller, and I am the Guest Experience Specialist here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I'd like to extend my sincere gratitude to you for choosing our hotel for your recent stay.
We here at Hyatt truly strive to care for people so they can be their best. I am so grateful that you took the time to complete our post-stay survey as your feedback assists us in ensuring the needs and desires of all of our guests are not only met but exceeded. I'm thrilled to see you had an overall great experience; however, I understand the desire for more seamless streaming on our in-room televisions. That said, while we do not have fire sticks or fully functional smart TVs with Netflix in the rooms, all of our TVs should have the ability to be casted to from your personal device. If you download the World of Hyatt app, there will be instructions on how to utilize this feature on there - you can also contact our on-site team for assistance with this at any time! I hope we can get you set up with that in the future so you can truly enjoy every part of our hotel's experience. 
Very glad to hear that our team had such a positive impact on your stay, though! I'll be sure to pass the recognition along. 
If there are any additional thoughts or feedback you have that you would like to share, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly. Otherwise, thanks again for your response, safe travels and I look forward to welcoming you back to Green Bay in the future!
Sincerely,

I'm so glad to hear that this information helped you decide to stay with us for your anniversary! Once you get your room reserved, let me know and I can see if we have any room upgrades available for you guys so you can have an even more exceptional experience.
For reference, too, as I see you may have been enrolled during your recent stay at our property, you can sign in to your World of Hyatt membership account through the app. Your membership # is - 582850836L, and the email address associated with your account is SMJACK0920@yahoo.com.
You can then use the app to manage your reservations, book directly through us at special member rates, and more!
Looking forward to welcoming you again - let me know if there's anything further that I can assist you with.
Best,

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Breton Spiller, and I am the Guest Experience Specialist here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assist us in improving our overall guest experience. 

We here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in not only meeting but exceeding our guests' expectations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. I do apologize that your experience was less than ideal due to the need for a number of updates to our hotel. I can assure you we are working diligently to get the ball rolling on some major renovations that will ideally address all of your concerns! We appreciate the feedback nonetheless though as it assists us in addressing areas to prioritize in our renovation plans. Renovations are tentatively set to begin within the next year, although, we are working to improve what we are able in the meantime. 

If there is any additional feedback in regard to how we can exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Once again, thank you for your response and don't hesitate to let me know if there is anything further that I can do for you.

My name is Breton Spiller, and I am the Guest Experience Specialist here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I'd like to extend my sincere gratitude to you for choosing our hotel for your recent stay.

We here at Hyatt truly strive to care for people so they can be their best. I am so grateful that you took the time to complete our post-stay survey as your feedback assists us in ensuring the needs and desires of all of our guests are not only met but exceeded. I'm thrilled to see you had an overall great experience and enjoyed our steam room, though I do apologize that the sauna was out of commission during your stay. We are certainly working to have it back up and running as soon as possible.

I also appreciate your comments about the towels and the pullout bed. I will make sure to share this with our housekeeping team so we can improve on proactively providing ample towels for larger parties, and we will certainly look into the comfort of the pullout beds for future stays. Additionally, I’ll pass along your suggestion regarding the availability of more toiletries at our little corner store, as we always aim to anticipate the needs of our guests. That said, I would like to acknowledge that we do have some small complimentary amenities such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, combs, soap, etc. at the front desk, too. 

If there are any additional thoughts or feedback you have that you would like to share, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly.

Thanks again for your response, safe travels, and I look forward to welcoming you back to Green Bay in the future!

I will certainly share the details about the hairs in the bathroom and the spots on the walls in the kitchenette area with our housekeeping team. We will work to ensure more mindfulness in these areas moving forward.
Additionally, we completely understand the need for updates hotel-wide and I'm happy to share that we have plans for major hotel-wide renovations that are tentatively set to begin (early stages at least) following the 2025 NFL Draft here in Green Bay. That said, I do know that we are working on improving what we are able to in the meantime!
So glad to hear our staff were welcoming and supportive during your stay, though! I'll be sure to pass the recognition along.
Thank you again for your feedback. Hope to welcome you again soon.

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Breton Spiller, and I am the Guest Experience Specialist here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I want to thank you for taking the time to share your feedback from your recent experience attending a wedding at our hotel. Your comments are truly valuable to us, and I deeply regret that your experience did not meet the high standards we strive to uphold.

I sincerely apologize for the issues you encountered with both the house-brand vodka and whiskey, as well as the food at the reception. It is certainly disappointing to hear that the drinks were not up to your expectations and that the food served was cold and details not properly communicated to guests. This is certainly not the level of service we aim to provide, and I will ensure that our food and beverage team reviews the event and addresses both the quality and presentation of the offerings.

If you would like to discuss your experience further, or if there is anything else I can assist with, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Once again, thank you for sharing your thoughts, and I regret that we did not meet your expectations. I hope that you will give us another opportunity to serve you in the future.

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Breton Spiller, and I am the Guest Experience Specialist here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I want to sincerely thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey and for sharing your experience. Your feedback is incredibly valuable in helping us improve the overall guest experience.

I apologize for the discomfort you experienced with the thermostat during your stay. It is certainly concerning that the room was much warmer than expected despite setting the thermostat at 69 degrees. I understand how frustrating it must have been to have to sleep with the patio door open, especially with the colder temperatures outside and the noise from the busy street. I will be sure to share your comments with our maintenance team so they can address the thermostat issue and ensure our rooms are properly regulating the temperature for future guests.

We strive to ensure the comfort and relaxation of every guest, and I deeply regret that we fell short of meeting those expectations during your stay. Your feedback will help us take the necessary steps to avoid this situation moving forward.

If there is any additional feedback in regard to how we can exceed your expectations in the future, or anything further that I can do for you, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Once again, thank you for your response.

It is feedback from our valued guests such as yourself that assists us in improving our overall guest experience.

We here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in not only meeting but exceeding our guests' expectations. However, based on your response, we recognize that there are areas where we can improve. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you experienced with the fridge freezing your food. I also regret that after adjusting the temperature, you had issues with the fridge not cooling properly. I’ll be sure to share this feedback with our maintenance team to investigate and resolve this issue.

Additionally, I understand that the temperature of the room and the pool did not meet your expectations. We always aim to ensure our guests are comfortable, and I’m sorry this wasn’t the case during your stay. I’ll be sure to share this with our engineering team as well to ensure all future guests are fully comfortable!

As a token of our appreciation for your feedback, and since you are a valued World of Hyatt member, I would like to offer you 3,000 World of Hyatt points to supplement the cost of any lost food due to the fridge issue. These points can be used toward future stays or other World of Hyatt rewards. Please just allow up to 7-10 business days for these to fully process and post to your account (though they may appear sooner).

If there is any additional feedback in regard to how we can exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Once again, thank you for your response, and don’t hesitate to let me know if there is anything further that I can do for you.

Sincerely,

2025-01-06 10:12:43] Email received from: Jill Hanson <jillshanson@gmail.com>: Hi Breton,
Thanks for your email!  I often wondered if anyone reads the survey
results.  I'm glad you did!
The only point of feedback I'd share is that I saw a picture somewhere on
the Hyatt website of a dog bed and water bowl, so I expected those to be in
the room when we arrived.  Of course, I can't find the link now that I'm
looking for it to show you.
It was not a problem for us, because we had what we needed in our vehicle,
so it just took a 2nd trip downstairs to get the rest of our stuff. But -
it could be confusing for other guests in the future.  Perhaps a note to
say ""this hotel does not provide dog bowls or beds"" would be helpful to
prevent confusion.
That's all!
Jill

2025-01-06 10:49:53] Reply Sent: Thank you, Jill! That is wonderful feedback.
While we don't manage our website, I will certainly share this suggestion with our corporate team! While I believe we do have a few dog bowls available on-site, we do not have dog beds and that could surely be more clear.
Thank you again for your thoughts and I'm glad my response had a positive impact for you!
Best wishes,

I am so grateful that you took the time to complete our post-stay survey as your feedback assists us in ensuring the needs and desires of all of our guests are not only met but exceeded. I'm thrilled to see you had an overall great experience! I do understand, however, that the walk to the convention center spaces can be a bit long, especially in heels, but I'm glad you made it over okay! At least you get to stay inside where it's warm instead of walking outside somewhere! I also understand that the food offerings were less-than-ideal, and I will certainly share this feedback with our food and beverage team. 

That said, so glad to hear that you found our team helpful and accommodating! I believe I was actually the one who assisted you with the room moves, and our Front Desk Supervisor Samantha would have been the other young lady at the desk that day. We both appreciate the recognition and are so glad to have been able to assist you during your stay.

2025-01-02 20:12:17] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Dear Julie Peick,

My name is Breton Spiller, and I am the Guest Experience Specialist here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us. Your comments are incredibly valuable as they help us continually improve and ensure a better experience for all of our guests.

I’m truly sorry to hear about the temperature issue in your room. Unfortunately, our HVAC system operates on a centralized system, which can sometimes make it difficult to control individual room temperatures. I can imagine how uncomfortable this must have been. If you had reached out to our team about this, I do apologize if they did not offer a fan during your stay, as we always have them available for guests to ensure they are as comfortable as can be. 

I also understand your frustration with the parking fee. While the $10 parking charge is intended to cover the convenience and security of our on-site parking, I recognize it was an unexpected cost in light of the other issues you experienced. As a gesture of goodwill, I am happy to refund this charge as a one-time courtesy. Please allow up to two business days for the refund to be reflected on your account.

Regarding the domestic incident you mentioned, I deeply regret any concern or discomfort it caused. Your safety and well-being are our top priority, and I can assure you that our security team, in collaboration with local authorities, was able to de-escalate the situation. We have taken note of the individuals involved and will take appropriate action to prevent any future disturbances.

Lastly, I’m sorry to hear about your experience with the hot tub and sauna. This is certainly not the standard we strive to maintain, and I have shared your feedback with our maintenance team so they can investigate and resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

Thank you once again for your valuable feedback. We truly hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back and provide a more seamless experience. If you have any additional concerns or need further assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me directly.

Sincerely,

Breton Spiller

My name is Breton Spiller, and I am the Guest Experience Specialist here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. First and foremost, I want to thank you for choosing our hotel for your recent stay and for taking the time to share your feedback with us. We truly appreciate you helping us identify areas for improvement so we can provide an even better experience for future guests.

I am sorry to hear about the challenges you encountered with the parking and your room. I would like to clarify that the room key serves as both the key to your room and your in/out pass for the parking lot. We regret that this wasn't clearly explained to you upon check-in, and we will ensure our team makes this process clearer to future guests. We certainly understand how frustrating it can be when expectations are not fully met, and we appreciate you bringing this to our attention.

In regard to the shampoo holder in the shower, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you experienced with the way these adhered to the wall. This is definitely something we will address promptly to ensure the room is fully functional for future stays.

Additionally, I am very sorry to hear about the communication challenges you faced when trying to contact the front desk. It is never our intention for guests to feel disregarded, and I truly regret that you were hung up on and placed on hold multiple times. This is certainly not the level of service we strive to provide, and I will follow up with our team to ensure that communication is more efficient moving forward. Additionally, you can always text our hotel assistance line as well at 920-354-8620 any time if you find yourself here with us again in the future. 

Thank you again for your feedback and your understanding. If you have any further comments or suggestions, or if there is anything else I can assist you with, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly. We look forward to welcoming you back and providing you with a much more seamless experience.

My name is Breton Spiller, and I am the Guest Experience Specialist here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I'd like to extend my sincere gratitude to you for choosing our hotel for your recent stay.

We here at Hyatt truly strive to care for people so they can be their best. I am so grateful that you took the time to complete our post-stay survey as your feedback helps us ensure that the needs and desires of all our guests are not only met but exceeded. I'm thrilled to see that you had an overall positive experience. However, I understand that the temperature issue in your room made getting ready for the wedding and staying comfortable challenging, and I truly regret the inconvenience that caused.

Unfortunately, our HVAC system operates as a centralized system, so adjustments in individual rooms may have limited impact depending on the building’s set seasonal mode. We completely understand how this impacted your stay, and we are actively working on implementing a more reliable, long-term solution for all rooms to better manage the temperature. These improvements are part of a broader renovation plan for the hotel, which is tentatively set to begin after the 2025 NFL Draft. In the meantime, we will continue to assist guests in making their rooms as comfortable as possible in any way we can. If you ever find yourself staying with us again in the future, please know that we do have fans available as well as the ability to turn off the heat in your guest room - just call the front desk and they will assist you! 

Please know that your feedback is very much appreciated, and I will be sure to share it with the appropriate team members. If you have any additional thoughts or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly.

Thanks again for your response, and I look forward to welcoming you back to Green Bay in the future!

Hopefully you get the changes by the time the NFL draft comes through. They were suppose to bring up a fan but never received it. We did get a piece of paper about the water and did joke about it and thought that was the fan we were got. We are understanding and I have been a travel agent and get what it takes to run the hotel. Not everything can be perfect. Thanks for the feedback but would definitely return or tell others to stay.
Best,

Unfortunately, most of the major renovations will not begin until after the draft as to ensure the building is functional during that period of high occupancy, however, shortly after is when balls should get rolling on that. We will also work to improve as much as we can in the meantime!
Glad to hear you will continue to stay, though and appreciate you recommending our hotel to others. If there's ever anything I can do to assist you or your acquaintances in having an exceptional stay, don't hesitate to reach out!

2025-01-02 14:39:24] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good afternoon, Katie,

My name is Breton Spiller, and I am the Guest Experience Specialist at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I want to personally thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us. Your input is invaluable in helping us improve our services and enhance the guest experience.

I'm pleased to hear that you consistently choose our hotel when visiting family, and I truly appreciate your kind words about our staff. We take great pride in providing exceptional service, and I’m glad that it has contributed to your loyalty.

That being said, I sincerely apologize for the issues you encountered during your recent stay. Providing a clean and well-maintained room is a top priority for us, and I’m sorry that your experience didn’t meet that standard. The cleanliness issues, missing amenities, and malfunctioning equipment you mentioned are certainly not reflective of the high standards we strive to maintain. I will make sure that these concerns are addressed with our housekeeping and maintenance teams immediately.

Regarding the $10 parking charge, I apologize for any surprise it caused. While this charge is not new, I understand how it may have been unclear, especially if previous visits involved a membership perk or another factor that waived the fee. I’ll work with our front desk team to ensure more transparent communication about parking fees in the future. For additional context, the $10 charge helps save guests $2 compared to the $12 standard fee for overnight parking at the gate. While this doesn’t eliminate the inconvenience, I hope it provides some clarity.

As a gesture of appreciation for your continued loyalty and to supplement our apologies for your recent experience, I’d like to offer you 5,000 bonus points to your World of Hyatt membership account. These points can be redeemed towards a future stay at any Hyatt property or other on-site amenities/offerings. If you’d like me to proceed with this, please let me know, and I’d be happy to get that submitted.

Once again, thank you for your feedback. We look forward to the opportunity to welcome you back for an improved stay. If you have any further suggestions or need anything else from me, please don’t hesitate to reach out directly.

Sincerely,

Subject: Your recent feedback at Hyatt Regency Green Bay
Good afternoon, Katie,
My name is Breton Spiller, and I am the Guest Experience Specialist at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I want to personally thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us. Your input is invaluable in helping us improve our services and enhance the guest experience.
I'm pleased to hear that you consistently choose our hotel when visiting family, and I truly appreciate your kind words about our staff. We take great pride in providing exceptional service, and I’m glad that it has contributed to your loyalty.
That being said, I sincerely apologize for the issues you encountered during your recent stay. Providing a clean and well-maintained room is a top priority for us, and I’m sorry that your experience didn’t meet that standard. The cleanliness issues, missing amenities, and malfunctioning equipment you mentioned are certainly not reflective of the high standards we strive to maintain. I will make sure that these concerns are addressed with our housekeeping and maintenance teams immediately.
Regarding the $10 parking charge, I apologize for any surprise it caused. While this charge is not new, I understand how it may have been unclear, especially if previous visits involved a membership perk or another factor that waived the fee. I’ll work with our front desk team to ensure more transparent communication about parking fees in the future. For additional context, the $10 charge helps save guests $2 compared to the $12 standard fee for overnight parking at the gate. While this doesn’t eliminate the inconvenience, I hope it provides some clarity.

It's so great to hear that the response had a positive impact for you. We certainly do take all of our guest's feedback seriously and want to ensure they feel heard and valued.
I have gone ahead and submitted those points for you, they should appear in your account within 7-10 business days, if not sooner. Let me know if for any reason they don't reflect by then.
I'm also very glad to hear that you intend to continue staying within the Hyatt brand and we truly appreciate your loyalty.
If there's anything further that I can assist you with, please let me know.
Best wishes,
Breton Spiller
