2019-12-28 07:01:43] Email received from: Melanie O'Brien <melanie.krause.obrien@gmail.com>: Hi Kolton,
We had a great stay, these were really minor things that I wouldn't have
brought up if not asked. We did call down about the TV. Basically, when you
turn it on it has static and doesn't work when you use the channel button
to go up and down or if you try to change the inputs. When the staff member
came up to help, she told us to just key in the channel we wanted to watch
and that worked. So, the questionnaire asked if anything didn't work as
expected and that was the TV in the bedroom part of the room.
Thank you for the follow up and have a great day,
Melanie

Thank you for staying with us recently at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay, as well as for being a loyal World of Hyatt member. I appreciate you providing us with such detailed feedback regarding your stay, as it allows us to have a guest's perspective in aspects of a stay we both excelled and fell short on.  I am sincerely apologetic that you received the service that you did/did not when you were our guest both for breakfast and dinner during your stay. We will utilize your feedback as a learning opportunity for our colleagues to grow and improve upon, so that they may better serve our guests in the future. In addition, I apologize that one of our colleagues was outwardly complaining about not feeling well around you and other guests. We will also address this with our team members. I sincerely hope that should you find yourself in Green Bay again, that you allow us the opportunity to serve you as a guest again so that we may provide you with the service and care we aim to provide to our guests.



Sincerely,

Rob Peterson

We ate twice in the bar.
First time we had wings and quesadilla, both we're hot, fresh and tasty.
Second time we ordered Pizza (crust very hard - you can tell the dough is not hand made on site, dry, not enough sauce or cheese), cheeseburger  (over cooked, dry , fries cold) and a Rueben tasted good, fries cold.
Thanks,
Sue

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and thank you for being a World of Hyatt member with us. We do appreciate hearing your feedback about your stay. 

We are sorry to hear that your room was not as tranquil as it could have been. We do place out the games on weekends, but make sure to have them put away by the evening. We are sorry that it was a bit loud. For the drink pricing, I will make sure to pass that along to our Banquets department in regards to that. We do hope that the rest of your stay went well. If you have any other feedback or comments you would like to pass along, feel free to reach out to me directly. 

We hope to see you again soon at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and thank you for being a World of Hyatt member. We do appreciate hearing your feedback about your stay. 

We are sorry to hear that your room did not meet your expectations. We strive to provide the best guest experience and we are sorry we fell short. I will make sure to pass along the feedback in regards to the bathroom. We are currently in the process of updating the hotel over the next few years. We are sorry about the rate change, as we have to match the local rates when home Packer games are released with their schedule. We are happy to hear that the staff was able to treat you well during your stay, and that the rest of your room was clean and comfortable. 

We hope you have a great day, and a happy holiday!

2019-12-19 08:13:19] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Dear Ms. Likens,

I sincerely apologize for the experience you had while staying with us at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I'm finding it difficult to convey through an email how horrified I am by the treatment you received from our colleagues.

I have already spoken with our Head of Security and Food & Beverage Manager regarding your experience. After putting some of the puzzle pieces together, I feel that there was misinterpretation and miscommunication surrounding the situation and our staff acted completely out of line. We are working with the colleagues that were involved and will be coaching them on better ways to asses a situation with guests and certainly handle situations better. Much to my frustration, a situation was created over ice cream - I can imagine how frustrated you that this situation got to the level it did.

I would also like to apologize that housekeeping did not clean your room while you were out of the room for 9 hours. I have spoken with our Executive Housekeeper so that she can work with her team to see where the ball was dropped. 

As a goodwill gesture, I have already credited back 1-night's room and tax. You will see $432.42 refunded back to your VISA in 7-10 business days if you view your account online. 

Again, I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences you experienced while staying with us. I want to assure you, we are coaching our team so that this never happens again. If you wish you discuss anything further with me, please do not hesitate to reach out - I will be glad to speak with you.

I wish you an your family the happiest of holidays.

Warm regards,

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. We appreciate your World of Hyatt membership with us and for choosing Hyatt Regency Green Bay from your recent stay. I have looked over your reservation and billing, and you do in fact have breakfast included. I have refunded the $27.32 to the card you provided on file, please allow 3-5 business days to reflect on to your account. There was an error in our system that caused it to have charged your room. We are trying our best to resolve this issue as we can. I apologize for the inconvenience and any confusion for this. Additionally, I apologize that we missed a mark during your breakfast experience. I hope you give us another chance to welcome you back to Hyatt Regency Green Bay! Please feel free to email me if you have any additional questions or concerns.

I have looked over your reservation and billing, and you do in fact have breakfast included. I have refunded the $27.32 to the card you provided on file, please allow 3-5 business days to reflect on to your account. There was an error in our system that caused it to have charged your room. We are trying our best to resolve this issue as we can. I apologize for the inconvenience and any confusion for this. Additionally, I apologize that we missed a mark during your breakfast experience. I hope you give us another chance to welcome you back to Hyatt Regency Green Bay! Please feel free to email me if you have any additional questions or concerns.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and thank you for being a World of Hyatt member. We do appreciate your continued loyalty to Hyatt. 

We are sorry to hear your stay did not go as well as expected. We strive to provide the best guest experience, and we are sorry we fell short. We will discuss with our team to ensure there is follow through with our front desk team for housekeeping requests, and ensuring they are completed. We are also sorry about the cleanliness of the ottoman, I will pass along the feedback to our housekeeping team. As for parking, we do charge $7 nightly for parking. As a one time courtesy, I have credited back the $7 charge, but do know in the future, you will have the parking charged to your room. I have emailed you an updated copy of your folio with the parking credited off. 

If you do stay with us again, know that there is an option to book a rate that includes the breakfast buffet up to four people. It tends to be more cost effective than paying for breakfast at the hotel. 

We do hope to see you again soon at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

Warm Regards,

Thank you for staying with us recently at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay, as well as for taking the time to complete the guest satisfaction survey for your stay. It appears that overall you enjoyed your stay with us. However, you indicated that we fell short in delivering a great experience when you dined with us. I am wondering if you would be willing and able to please provide any details on how we missed the mark in this aspect of your stay? We utilize feedback from guests such as yourself as a means to learn and grow from, so that we may better serve our guests in future stays. Please let me know if there is anything else regarding your stay I may assist you with as well. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience Ms Rinehart.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and thank you for being a Globalist with the World of Hyatt with us! We appreciate your continued loyalty to Hyatt hotels, and Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

We are sorry about the issues you experienced during your stay. We as a hotel strive to provide the best experience and we are sorry that we fell short. 

With check-ins, we try to get everyone in as soon as they arrive, but unfortunately we were only able to get you into one of the two rooms early. With being a Globalist, we select the best room to meet your specified needs and notes on your profile, to ensure that we can get you the best stay experience overall, and hope that both rooms met your expectations for the duration of your stay. For our hotel shuttle, it is based on availability. Unfortunately we cannot accommodate  every ride a guests needs. In the future, and you would need the shuttle during your stay, please call, or email ahead of time, and we will be happy to accommodate you. Please try to reach out 5-7 days before arrival to ensure we can accommodate it. As for the city shuttle for the Packer Game Day, we have discussed with all agents at the desk to ensure that we are on the same page for the shuttle game day times to ensure no confusion going forward. We are sorry that it was not expressed to you at check in when the shuttle stopped running. 

If you have any other questions or concerns from your stay, please feel free to reach out to me at kolton.madlem@hyatt.com. 

We hope to see you again soon, and Happy Holiday's!

When we went in, a girl seated us and asked about drinks. We asked if you had Prosecco. She disappeared and never returned. We also asked if she could put the Wisconsin game on the two TVs we were facing and she never returned. We went to the bar and the man there would not help us either. We then had another server come over and it felt like it was his first night ever working. It took 3 times to get us water. We ordered prosecco and what we got was definitely not prosecco.  He later came back and said it's only served by the bottle so they weren't going to charge us. I'm not sure what wine it was, but it was old. We finally ordered but that was a challenge too. We asked if the chicken wings were breaded and if there were other types of cheese but he did not know and had to go check and took forever to come back. We finally got our food 45 minutes later (was not busy). They never checked on us until much later when we finally ordered a bottle of wine. We were very nice the whole time and not sure why were treated so poorly.

On saturday, we came in after the Packers game and went straight to the bar. We were not greeted in a nice way but we did ask to order a bottle of wine to go and some chicken wings. The first bottle of wine she brought wasn't even the right one (my friend is allergic to California wines) and when we told her she didn't apologize or anything and just rudely walked away and got the new bottle, opened it up away from us and then brought it back. A server finally brought our wings to go but the bartender never thanked us or said anything more.

Thank you for sharing your feedback with us. 

I sincerely apologize that the condition of your room was not up to the Hyatt standard we strive for every day. I have shared your feedback with our Executive Housekeeper so that we can ensure our housekeepers are trained properly and ensure rooms are inspected prior to guest's arrivals. As for your request for 2 pack-n-plays, your request was in the system for two to be sent to your room. I will be following up with my team to see where the breakdown of communication was and how we can improve following through on guest requests in the future.

As a goodwill gesture for the inconvenience you experienced, I am applying 8,000 points to your World of Hyatt account. This is the equivalent of a 1-night stay at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. We appreciate your loyalty to the Hyatt brand and hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back to Green Bay in the future. 

If there is anything else you would like to discuss with me, please do not hesitate to reach out. I will be glad to speak with you.

Warm regards,

Thank you for your honest feedback in our survey. I sincerely apologize that your stay with us was more frustrating than it was relaxing and comfortable on your drive.

I logged into my World of Hyatt app and I could see what you're referring to. I spoke with my contact from our Global Technology Team and pet fees and other hotel fees are not listed on the app aside from parking. Parking and Transportation takes you to a different page in the app where they can post information about both options. Hyatt Hotels that are pet friendly list it as an amenity and that list can vary from hotel to hotel and does not take you to a separate page - it's just a list of amenities. I checked 6 properties around the United States that are pet friendly and none have their fees listed in the app. Our website, as well as other properties sites, do make the hotel fees available to you - that's on the website though, not the app. I have shared your feedback with the Global Technology Team to see if that is an update that can take place in the future on the app. 

In regards to the interactions you had with the front desk staff, I will be speaking with all of them individually in regards to your concerns. I will personally be working with my staff to ensure they know the proper way to assist guests in situations where there is a conflict of information.Your concerns could have been handled better; however, the policy of the Hyatt Regency Green Bay covers all guests with pets and you were provided with our policy, regardless of where it was posted. Pet cleanings are handled by housekeeping differently and do take more time upon check out. The policy is applied equally to all guests with a pet. There was no malicious intent by Hyatt Hotels to hide information and I sincerely apologize that you feel that way. If you do choose to stay with Hyatt Hotels in the future, please reach out to the hotel directly to ask about their pet fees. I would highly recommend checking with all hotel brands as well as many do charge pet cleaning fees. 

As a goodwill gesture for the confusion and inconvenience, I have gone ahead and waived the pet fee for you. You should see the refund posted in your account in 7-10 business days. 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. 

Warm regards and have a happy holiday season,

Thank you for your quick response Paul, it is very much appreciated as is the refund.
I would expect there to be a pet fee for hotels, and have found these to sit around the $25 mark.   But what I found inconsistent was the lack of information on the App.  I am pleased this has been passed onto the IT crew as a comment.
Thank you again

920.321.5080",,1,,"I had to stop to break up a long drive, so using the App I looked at Green Bay Hyatt for a stop.  Very clearly the App states that the hotel is pet-friendly, and that parking is avaialble for $7 per night.  I read all the terms and policies of the App for the pet fee and could find nothing.  Great, I booked in and arrived 20 minutes later.  On arrival I was told that $100 pet fee applied for my chihuahua and no explanation could be given why this is not stated on the App.  I had the choice to cancel the booking and forfeit the room payment, or pay the $100.  I would loose $100 bucks either way, so I stayed.  I did complain and speak to management.  They were unhelpful and could only find the pet fee on their full website, which defeats the purpose of having an App for ease of booking.  My chihuahua went from dog transport container to travel crate without ever touching the ground.  Hope the $100 deep clean fee I paid meant the person after me enjoy the extra work the staff had to do on my departure!!",,1,1,4,4,5,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,27,,Control,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,""""",,,,,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thank you for sharing your feedback in our Guest Satisfaction Survey! We appreciate the positive review.

I will be sure to share this with our Engineering Team so that they can inspect the refrigerator. Also, the room category that you were booked into has an armoire and does not have a chair to allow for the most floor space for Guests. It is also considered a Studio Suite. For your future visits, if you would like, please request a One Bedroom Suite. The rooms are arranged a little bit differently to accommodate your needs.

If there is anything else we can do to assist you, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for staying with us recently at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay, as well as for being a loyal World of Hyatt member! I also thank you for submitting our guest satisfaction survey regarding your stay. It appears that you had an enjoyable stay overall. It does, however, appear that we fell short of your expectations when you dined with us during your stay. I am wondering if you would be willing and able to please provide any feedback on how/why we missed the mark in this aspect of your stay? We utilize feedback such as this from guests like yourself, to learn and improve upon so that we may better serve our guests in future stays. In addition, please let me know if there is anything else about your stay I may assist you with. I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for sharing your feedback on our Guest Satisfaction Survey. 

I'm disappointed to read that we did not meet your expectations and that you would not recommend our hotel due to our parking fee. Due to the limited size of our parking lot and the high demand for parking in Green Bay, we do have a fee to ensure our guests have a safe, clean lot close to the hotel. Our parking fee is aligned with other hotels in the area. I have reviewed your hotel folio from your stay and upon check-in, the fee was never applied to your room. You were not charged for parking on your reservation.

Please do not hesitate to reach out if you would like to discuss this further. We look forward to welcoming you back to Green Bay in the future.

Sincerely,

Thank you for taking our Guest Satisfaction Survey. I sincerely apologize that we did not meet your expectations during your stay.

I would like an opportunity to know what I can do to assist you. When we saw your reservation in our pre-arrival report and read the reviews you left on Google and Facebook, we wanted to make sure we did everything in our power to make your stay comfortable and relaxing. We attempted to reach out to you twice. I was advised by our Director of Sales, Tracy and our Reservations Manager, Carrie that they both attempted to reach out to you and their request to assist you were not responded to. 

Prior to your arrival, we blocked your room so that no other guests were in the room the night before. Our Executive Housekeeper and one of our senior housekeepers personally attended to your room to ensure the room was prepared for your arrival. The day of your arrival, our Executive Housekeeper then inspected the room again to ensure nothing changed prior to your arriving. Your room was handled with the utmost care so that your experience was better than before. No one had access to your room aside from you and our Executive Housekeeper. 

I personally checked you out of your room on the morning of departure. You did not bring any of your concerns to my attention. Also, our attempts at reaching out have been going unanswered. As discussed in previous communication, you and your father were compensated for your inconveniences from earlier in 2019. 

My question for you is what can I do to assist you? How can we resolve your concerns and your multiple negative reviews? 

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help. I am available via email and or phone call.

Thanks for the follow up. I really have no details about the no soy, no almond, and no other non dairy milk at the cafe downstairs, other than I was told they were out of all three. Other than that and the temperature (boy those meeting rooms are cold too!), it was a pleasant stay.
Thanks again.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and thank you for being a World of Hyatt member.  We do appreciate hearing feedback from our guests about their stay. 

We are sorry to hear about the heating issues you experienced during your stay. We strive to provide the best guest experience for our guests during their stay and we are sorry we fell short. With our heating system in our hotel, it is always a struggle to meet everyone preferred temperature as we use an HVAC system.  The HVAC system has two modes, hot and cold mode. With whichever mode is chosen, it is the same mode throughout the hotel.  Depending on the mode, the room is either heated, or cooled, by air being blown over hot water pipes, or cold water pipes. This can cause issues with the rooms not heating up as fast as guests would like. For your stay, we were experience computer issues with some of the rooms and being able to control the temperatures in the room and not being able to heat the rooms properly. Our engineering department works on this daily to try and provide the most comfortable stays for our guests. When the heating system doesn't cooperate, we will use space heaters to help out in trying to keep the guests comfortable. If all else fails, we move a guest to a new room. We do hope the room move was able to provide a better experience for the second part of your stay. 

Due to the heating issues you did have, I have gone ahead and applied 8,000 bonus points onto your World of Hyatt account as compensation. 

We do hope to see you again at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. We do appreciate hearing feedback from our guests about their stay. 

We are sorry to hear that your room was not as clean as it should have been. That is not up to our standards, and we are sorry you experienced this. I will make sure to pass along the feedback to our housekeeping team to ensure this will not happen going forward. 

We hope to see you again soon at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

2019-11-25 11:35:40] Email received from: rsebanc dsebanc <sebanc1@yahoo.com>: Hi Kolton!
Thank you for reaching out! I will say that other than a few encounters I had with a particular gentleman at the front desk, our stay was fine. He was in his 30s ish, light hair and well dressed. Due to the fact that we had a very busy schedule that weekend, I had a few questions as the weekend went on, and at one point the gate to exit the parking lot was not working so I simply let the front desk know about this situation. This particular fellow was very condescending and dismissive to my questions and comments. I made a point of avoiding him for the remainder of our stay. I would like to again reiterate that the rest of the front desk staff was fine.
This was disappointing, especially as a new rewards member I was hoping for more. I have been an IHG rewards member for many years and have never ran into such entitlement at a front desk.
I hope this helps.
My very best,
Robert Sebanc

I am very sorry to hear that you were treated that way by one of our agents. I will make sure to address this with the agent in question to ensure that it will not happen again.
As compensation for the unpleasant experience, I’m going to apply 5,000 bonus points onto your World of Hyatt account. It can take a few days to be processed, but I have the request submitted and is being processed.
We do hope to see you again soon at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. We do appreciate to hear feedback from our guests about how their stay was with us. 

We are sorry to hear about the heating system being rather noisy in your room during your stay. I will make sure to have maintenance take a look at that room and make sure it is working properly. 

We are, however, happy to hear that the rest of your stay seemed to go well especially with breakfast and the Pub 333. We strive to provide the best guest experience overall, and we are happy we hit the marks with you. 

We hope to see you again soon at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and thank you for being a World of Hyatt member with us. We do appreciate to hear feedback from our guests. 

We are sorry to hear about the poor experience you had with our hot tub. We strive to provide the best guest experience in all aspects, and we are sorry we fell short. It turns out that the emergency shut off switch was hit on the hot tub, causing the heater to shut down on the hot tub over the course of the weekend. This explains for the cold temperatures during your stay. I will ensure we discuss with our maintenance staff to ensure that we are thoroughly checking the water temperature more frequently to ensure it does not occur again. 

We are happy to hear the reset of your stay had gone well overall and that your room was quiet for you. I know when hockey teams are in house, it is not always the quietest, and I'm happy it was for you. We are also sorry about the accidental breakfast overcharge, but we are happy it was able to be corrected. 

We hope to see you again soon at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey and thank you for being a World of Hyatt member. We do appreciate your feedback from your recent stay with us. 

We are sorry to hear that the TV guide did not correspond with the channels on your TV. I can understand that can be frustrating and we are sorry for that. I will make sure to pass along that feedback so we can get those updated. 

We hope to see you again soon at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and thank you for being an Explorist with the World of Hyatt. We do appreciate your continued loyalty to Hyatt. 

We are sorry to hear your stay was not as tranquil as it could have been. We strive to try and provide guests with the most tranquil experience and we are sorry we fell short. This past weekend was more noisy than usual due to a few hockey teams being in house. With that being said, it was no excuse for it being loud and we are sorry for that. We do hope the next time you stay with us, it will be a more tranquil experience for you. 

We hope to see you again soon at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. We do appreciate hearing feedback from our guests.

We are sorry to hear that the heat in your room was not working properly during your stay. We strive to provide the best guest experience, and we are sorry we fell short. 


We are also sorry about the poor experience in the pool and hot tub. It was brought to our attention and was discovered that someone had hit the emergency shut off switch, which causes the hot water pump to shut off and cause the hot tub to cool down. We are sorry that did happen, but know if you stay with us in the future, it will be much warmer than it was during your stay. 

We hope to see you again soon at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and thank you for being a World of Hyatt member. We do appreciate hearing feedback from our guests about their stay. 

We are sorry to hear your rooms cleanliness fell short during your stay. We strive to have each of our guest rooms be as clean as possible, and we are sorry we fell short. I will make sure to pass along the feed back to our housekeeping department so it can be addressed. We hope the rest of your stay went well.

Thank you so much for taking the time to fill out our survey and providing us with feedback about your stay. While I'm glad to see you enjoyed the majority of your stay, I sincerely apologize, as we fell short on your dining experience and missed the mark with our service. We will use the information you provided as a learning experience and hope to surpass your expectations if we have the opportunity to serve you again.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey and thank you for being a World of Hyatt member. We do appreciate hearing feedback from our guests. 

We are sorry to hear that your stay was not as tranquil as it could of been. We strive to provide the most tranquil stay for our guests, and we are sorry we fell short. We will take your feedback into consideration going forward with how we put out our games in the atrium. We currently place them out only on Friday's and Saturday's, when primarily families are visiting the hotel for something to do during the day. We make sure to enforce quiet hours from 9 PM to 7 AM to the best of our abilities, and we are sorry we had fallen short. 

If there were any other noise concerns that you did not address in your comments, please feel free to reach to me at kolton.madlem@hyatt.com, and I will be happy to address them. 

We hope to see you again soon at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

2019-11-18 11:28:54] Email received from: MICHAEL BULL <michaelpbull@aol.com>: Thank you for reaching out to me regarding my review of my stay at the Hyatt.. I don’t think it was anything that you personally did or any one individual that caused me to be not fully satisfied with the food, but probably more of the fact that it is a buffet. I just felt like the eggs were overcooked and have been sitting in the pan for a while and we’re not fresh and soft, and even when the coffee was poured directly from the pot into the cup I just did not feel like it was hot and it was warm at best. Of course being from the south I would like to have seen grits but I knew that was not going to happen, laughing out loud. I did not think the bacon was cooked enough. It was soft and rubbery rather than Crisp and chewy. Again I think it had more to do with it was a buffet rather than me ordering directly from the menu. Thank you for requesting my input

I would first like to thank you for choosing the Hyatt Regency of Green Bay for your stay, and for taking the time to leave us vital feedback. It looks like your overall experience with the hotel was good, but that we seriously fell short in PUB333 for expectations. I apologize for the poor service that you received that evening. From my understanding, I know that we were exceptionally busy, but that is still no excuse for poor service. I will be taking this feedback back to our team and our leaders to use as a learning experience and training tool, so that we can effectively handle such high volumes better in the future. I hope that you will return to PUB333 during your next stay so that we can have the chance to show you how we have improved on our service. 

Have a great day.

Thank you for sharing your feedback with us.

I sincerely apologize that you were disappointed with your stay and the rates we offered as park of your event. While Green Bay Packer home games can affect room rates throughout the city, we value our weddings guests and their families. Brides and grooms work with our Weddings Team and contract discounted rooms as well as other benefits, too. The bride and groom signed a contract that offered discounts of $160/per night as well as offered complimentary parking, one-night requirements, the option to change/cancel reservations within 48-hours, and available late check-outs. Guests staying with us during game day weekends and NOT part of a wedding group are required to book 2-night minimum stays that are pre-paid and non-refundable reservations. They are also charged for parking and are limited for late check-outs.

As for your concern about the temperature of the room, thank you for bring that to our attention during your stay. I am glad that our team was able to get you moved into a more comfortable room. I will share your feedback with our Leadership Team. 

Please let me know if there is anything else you would like to discuss.

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski
Front Office Manager

I'm surprised to hear about this type of reaction coming from a member of my team. I apologize for your experience with this.

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. We appreciate your loyalty with World of Hyatt and appreciate guest feedback as it is utilized as a training and coaching opportunity for our colleagues. I apologize for the lack of cleanliness in your guest room and if this impacted your overall stay. I have passed on your concerns with housekeeping so we can prevent it from happening in the future. This certainly was not up to our standards and I apologize for the experience you had. I hope our team was able to assist you to your satisfaction  and that we can improve your impression of the hotel. Once again, thank you for addressing this concern. We hope we can provide experience for you in the future.

Thank you for being our guest here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay, while you were attending the FISS convention. I am pleased to see that overall you enjoyed your stay with us.

We utilize feedback from guests such as yourself as an opportunity to continually improve and learn from; so that we may meet---and hopefully exceed---the expectations of our guests in all facets of their stay(s).

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. We appreciate guest feedback as it is utilized as a training and coaching opportunity for our colleagues. I would like to apologize about the issues experienced during your stay especially the lack of cleanliness and inadequate parking spaces in the front lot.  Our overnight parking fee in the front lot is normally $7 with in and out access, we did not charge your reservation for this parking fee. The overflow parking ramp is in place during full occupancy for our hotel rooms and convention events. I apologize if the front office host did not mention the pricing during check-in. I will certainly pass on these concerns with our front office host so that we may better inform guests. Once again, I am sorry for the lack of information and for the guest room cleanliness. We hope to provide a better experience for you in the future. Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns.

Sincerely,

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and thank you for being a World of Hyatt member. We are sorry to hear about the heating issues you had during your stay. With our hotel, our heating and cooling systems have two modes, heat and cool mode. At this time of the year, the property is in heat mode, where we are unable to activate the cool mode for certain areas. We are sorry we were unable to have engineering take a look at your room, and see about turning off the fan to your room so it does not continue to blow warm air into the room. I will make sure to pass along the feedback to ensure that we address any heating concerns with the utmost priority. 

We hope to see you again soon at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.


Sincerely,

Kolton Madlem

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. We do appreciate hearing feedback from our guests. We are sorry to hear about the issues that occurred with the television and phone in your room. I will make sure to pass along feedback in regards to the television guides, and see about getting it updated to prevent future complications. I am happy to hear we were able to fix the telephone in your room. We are also sorry to hear about the issues with getting a luggage trolley. Unfortunately with larger groups in house, our fleet of five luggage carts get utilized for long periods of time and are not always returned in a timely manner. 

We do hope to see you again soon at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. We do appreciate to hear feedback from our guests from their stay.  We understand that you are upset in regards to the parking fee. As a one time courtesy, I have credited off the cost of the parking in the amount of $14 for you. Do know in the future if you stay with us again, there will be a parking fee associated with your stay when parking in our lot. We hope that the rest of your stay went well with us. If you have any other concerns about your stay, please feel free to email me at kolton.madlem@hyatt.com. 

We hope to see you again soon at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

2019-10-30 11:14:14] Email received from: sandra mcguire <mcguires44@yahoo.com>:      I only answered the question about the dining negatively because we came to have breakfast at the hotel and two of our group got the buffet and myself and my husband ordered breakfast.  I tried avocado toast which I had never had before.  It took so long for us to get our meal even though there were very few people in the dining room and the others had gotten the buffet that we were in danger of being late for getting to the airport in time.  I had to remind the waiters and when we finally got the meals, I gave half to my son and had to eat fast even though we had given ourselves plenty of time.  My son said the avocado toast was not good.  He had had that dish in other restaurants. The buffet was good and we should have gotten that.  I don't mean to complain but I was trying to be honest when I completed the survey.  Sandra McGuire

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. We do appreciate hearing feedback from our guests about their stay. We're sorry to hear that your rooms bathroom did not meet your satisfaction. We will pass along your feedback to housekeeping to address this, so it will not occur in the future. As for our televisions in the guest rooms, they are equipped with Chrome cast, which allows you to stream from your tablets or phone to the television to simulate those features of a smart TV. So unfortunately, it is not a full smart TV, but does have some of the features of one. 

We hope to see you again soon at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

2019-10-30 14:16:40] Email received from: Ed Johnson <ejfromwi@gmail.com>: Hello:
Thank you for your interest.  The problem was not with my food, as I had
the fish tacos, and they were fine.  The reubens that two other guests
ordered were not up to any kind of standard.  One person complained that it
was ""fatty,"" and I didn't think much of that until he stripped off the
bread and several of the pieces were almost entirely fat.  I had never seen
that in a piece of corned beef before.  The other person's reuben had the
same trouble.  Several pieces that were nearly entirely fatty.  This in a
piece of meat that was approximately 2.5 inches by 2.5 inches.  So it
wasn't a little strip.  Then the other problem was a diner at our table of
seven that had ordered fish and chips, his order did not come until nearly
30 minutes after the other six were served.  As it is often polite to wait
until all are served before eating, this would have made everyone's dinner
cold.  Instead, we ate while he waited . . . and waited.  Finally, upon
pointing out to our server the difficulties, it took an inordinate amount
of time to get our checks and then get the checks processed.  The manager
of the hotel came over and made an adjustment of taking off the 18%
gratuity because we were a table of seven, but the time this took to do all
this processing was altogether too long.
I am not by nature a complainer -- have never sent back a meal in my life,
and am typically very generous with my ratings.  However, I felt this
experience overall was just not up to the Hyatt's standards and needed to
be registered.  I look forward to staying there again at some point, and
certainly will give 333 another chance.  But again, thank you for asking.
I am sure this is an aberration.  Take care.

Thank you for being our guest here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay; while you were attending the League of Municipalities convention. It appears that overall you enjoyed your stay with us.

Please let me know if there is anything else related to your stay I may assist you with Mr Pasha.

2019-10-30 17:27:37] Email received from: M Murphy <melissamurphy922@gmail.com>: Hi Rob, I just want to take another opportunity to say how much we enjoyed
our stay.  I don't recall our servers name, she was a blond, and it was
Thursday evening, around 4pm-maybe a little later, if that helps at all.
The bartender who served our food didn't introduce himself, but was super
pleasant.   I hope that providing the time that we were there was helpful.
We are already trying to find a time to visit again. The gentleman who
checked us out was also very nice. (Sunday morning, around 8am- I'm
terrible at remembering names!)
Warmest regards,
Melissa

Thank you for sharing your feedback with us in the Guest Satisfaction Survey. I want to apologize that your experience during your daughter's special weekend was not as you were hoping for.

We work with brides and grooms to make sure their accommodations are comfortable and we look forward to celebrating with families on their special day. Wedding rooms are blocked and the rates that are set are approved by the bride and groom and signed into contract. Green Bay Packer home games can affect those rates; however, there is still a significant savings plus other benefits for wedding parties. There is also a lot of other times during the year where rates are not as high. 

The standard rate for the weekend of your daughter's wedding was $469.00. The wedding rate that was contracted was $309.00. We also offer complimentary parking, do not require a two-night minimum, and allow wedding guests to cancel their reservations with 48 hour notice. Guests staying in Green Bay during Green Bay Packer home games are required to book a 2-night minimum stay, pre-pay for the reservation in full, and are not allowed to cancel their reservations. They are also charged for parking as well.

I apologize that some of your guests felt that the accommodations that the bride and groom selected did not meet their needs. 

If you would like to discuss anything else about your stay with me, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. We do appreciate to hear feedback from our guests about their stay. I am sorry about the miscommunication in regards to the parking charges not being removed. It did show the charge on our end on the final receipt, but I have since gone ahead and removed the charge, credited back the card, and you should receive a new email copy of the receipt. Typically with Hyatt Regency brand hotels, there is some form of parking charge, and removing it is a one time courtesy. Know in the future, parking will be charged out at $7 if you do stay with us. 

Thank you again, and hope you have a wonderful day.

The next morning my dad and I got up at 3am - got ready and went downstairs to check out at 3:45am. We were putting our items in the car at 3:50 when the shuttle left without us.

Thank you taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. We do appreciate to hear feedback from our guests on their stay. I am sorry to hear about the issues you had with initially trying to book the reservations. I do know that with the honors flights, there was some confusion of it being named the Flight of Champions, which had differed from years past. We are also sorry about the shuttle confusion in the morning. I will make sure to discuss with our shuttle team to verify with people who reserved for the shuttle to get boarded before allowing additional passengers to board. We will make sure to address that issue so it does not occur again. We appreciate your father's service and sorry about the issues that did occur. We hope the rest of the day went well.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and thank you for being a World of Hyatt member. We are sorry to hear about the issues you had during your stay with your room. We strive to provide our guests with the best experience, and we are sorry we fell short. We appreciate the feedback in regards to our rooms, as we are always looking for ways to improve our guest rooms. Our ADA rooms have handicap bars in the shower, as well as around the toilet. So next time you do stay with us, please request either of those room types. I am sorry about the noise from the atrium. Unfortunately with the design, voices do carry easily. We try to quiet any loud guests down after 9:30 at night, as our quiet hours are from 9:30 PM to 6 AM. We are also sorry about the parking situation. With street parking, we cannot guarantee it will be safe or the car will not be towed, as they typically do not allow overnight parking on the roads. 

We hope to see you again soon at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

Good Afternoon Ms. Bennett, 

I would, first, like to thank you for being a guest with Hyatt Regency of Green Bay, and for providing us with this vital feedback. I apologize for the service that you received within our establishment on Monday evening. This is not our standard and with feedback like yours we can strive to do better. You are correct in stating that being busy is no excuse for poor service. I will be taking this feedback back to our team so that we can use this as a learning experience to improve. I hope that in your next stay with Hyatt Regency of Green Bay, you will give the team here at PUB333 a second chance to show you how we have learned and taken our service to a higher level.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and thank you for being a Discoverist with the World of Hyatt. We do appreciate your continued loyalty with Hyatt. We are sorry to hear about the issues you had during your stay with the A/C panel, and not having it fixed. We strive to be attentive and be able to fix any issues that arise and we are sorry we felt short. We are happy to hear you were able to the room to cool down by ventilating the room with the patio door. Also, when the hotel first opened in the 1980's, it was an Embassy Suites. It has had quite a few remodels over the years, but we are always looking for new ways to improve the hotel rooms. We will keep the feedback for the bathroom size in mind with our upcoming remodels. 

We hope to see you again soon at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and thank you for being a World of Hyatt member. We are sorry to hear that your room was not as clean as it could have been. We strive to provide clean rooms for our guests, and am sorry that we did not meet that standard with your room. We will make sure to pass along the feedback to our housekeeping department to address this. We are also sorry about the room temperature not being warm enough. Unfortunately, our hotel only has two modes, heat or cool mode, and at the time of your visit, our hotel was in cool mode. We are only able to have one mode at a time, and not able to adjust to a per room basis. 

We hope to see  you again soon at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

We are sorry to hear about the issues you had on arrival and during your stay with locating luggage trolleys.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and thank you for being a World of Hyatt member. We are sorry to hear you had issues with the temperature in your room during your stay. Unfortunately with our hotels heating and cooling system, we either have a heat mode or cool mode. At the time of your visit, we were in cool mode, so the best we could do to try and rectify the situation is offer a space heater and more blankets. We unable to adjust the rooms to guest individual needs more than a few degrees. We are also sorry about your poor lunch service in our Pub 333. I will pass on the feed back to our Food and Beverage Department for them to review as well. We are also underway with plans to renovate our hotel in the upcoming year, hoping to make the stays more enjoyable for our guests. We are sorry that you were not satisfied with the state of the room, I will pass along the feedback to our Housekeeping department to be able to assess going forward. 

We hope to see you again soon at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey and thank you for being a World of Hyatt member. We appreciate your continued loyalty to Hyatt. We are sorry to hear you had issues with the working order of your room. We are sorry that the remote for the bedroom TV and the night light did not work. We strive to try and have everything in the room be in working order for our guests and am sorry we fell short. Do know the next time you stay with us that you can call down and we will have someone up as soon as possible to promptly rectify the issue. 

We hope to see you again soon at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. 

Sincerely,

Kolton Madlem

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. I am pleased you chose our hotel to enjoy your husband's birthday! However, I would like to apologize that your card was charged for your complimentary breakfast, there seemed to be an error posting when it charged to the room. I went ahead and adjusted off $27.32 from your total bill, please allow a few business days to reflect on your account. I hope that we were able to assist you to your satisfaction. Please let me know if you have any additional concerns, we appreciate guest feedback as it is utilized as a training and coaching opportunity for our colleagues.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out the guest satisfaction survey and thank you for being a World of Hyatt member. We appreciate your continued loyalty to Hyatt. We are sorry to hear that you had some issues with the working order of your room. We strive to have everything in working order for when our guests arrive and sorry we fell short with this. We are happy we were able to rectify the toilet issue as soon as it was brought to our attention. We are also sorry about the issues with the thermostat and the heating and cooling system in your room. Do know in the future if you stay with us, and the fan is too loud, or the room is too cold, please call the front desk and we will try to have maintenance adjust it for you. Otherwise, we can always try to do a room move to another room. We are sorry we were unable to do either of these options for you.

We hope to see you again in the future at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

Good Evening Ms. Carlson, 

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. I am sorry to hear that you had miscommunication issues during your stay. For your tax exempts, you are still able to send that in to have taxes removed. Feel free to email the tax exempt form to my email and I'll happily remove them for you and credit back the card. As for parking, I do not see any parking charges on your room for your stay. Normally, parking is $7 per night, with unlimited in and out privileges. You should never have to pay at the gate, as the ticket should validated each time before you head out. I am also sorry to hear that the room was not to your liking for the temperature. We strive to provide the best experience for our guests during your stay, and am sorry we were unable to meet that for you. I am also sorry about the water leaking in  your room, we try to keep the maintenance up to par with the building, and are sorry we fell short. 

Again, please feel free to email me your tax exempt form and I will be happy to credit back the card. I will then send you an updated folio with the taxes taken off. 

Sincerely,

Kolton Madlem

Dear Ms. Hisel,

Thank you for taking the time to complete our Guest Satisfaction Survey. 

I sincerely apologize that your check-in experience was not up to the high level of service we strive to provide at Hyatt. So that I have an opportunity to provide feedback to Rey, if you are comfortable wish sharing more information about your experience, I would greatly appreciate it.

I am constantly working with my team to provide an efficient and welcoming check-in/-out experience. Your feedback on how we can improve that process is welcomed.

If there is anything else I can do to assist you, please do not hesitate to let me know. I look forward to hearing from you.

2019-10-01 05:41:57] Email received from: Paul Papadopulos <paul.papadopulos@atriumhospitality.com>: Hello Pavy
Great stay but when we had breakfast at 9.30ish the scrambled eggs looked as if they had been there for some time.  My colleague also commented on the taste of the gravy as she had the biscuits and gravy.  That was it from a food standpoint.  As far as the atmosphere of the space, it was a little uncomfortable being seated in an area that meeting and convention guests use as a thoroughfare for gaining access to the convention center.  Not super intimate for a quiet breakfast.
Gravy is subjective and there is not much you can do about the location your breakfast space occupies so take it for what it's worth.
Thank you for caring.  Neither of these items would prevent me from returning.
Have a great day!
Paul P.

Thank you for staying with us recently at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay, and for taking the time to provide us with feedback about your stay. I apologize about the issues you encountered with the cleanliness of the pillowcases and bathroom during your stay. I will pass your remarks along to our Housekeeping team for follow-up. I also apologize for any misunderstanding and/or inconvenience you and/or anyone in your room experienced regarding breakfast during your stay. During breakfast service if a guest has breakfast included in their room, we do require that they still sign for the charges and the charges (except for gratuity) will be removed upon check out. I apologize if that was not explained to you and/or your daughter more thoroughly at check-in. We will utilize your feedback as an opportunity to learn and grow from for all teams involved. Please let me know if there is anything else related to your stay I may assist you with. I sincerely hope we have the opportunity to serve you as our guest again in the future!

We try to provide the most tranquil setting for our guests for their stay, and are sorry it fell short this time.

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. We appreciate your World of Hyatt membership and guest feedback as it is utilized as a training and coaching opportunity for our colleagues. I would like to apologize for the experience you had with our customer service at the desk and the miscommunication with reservations. I have double checked your billing and want to confirm that no amount was charged on your credit card, and the authorization hold of $394.20 has already been released by the hotel. Additionally, I have added 8,000 points to your World of Hyatt membership that you may redeem at any Hyatt property. I truly am sorry for the experience you had as it was certainly not up to our standards as well. For any future reservations, you may visit Hyatt.com or speak with an on-site reservations manager so that we can book the best available rate. You may also contact me directly if you have any future questions or requests. Thank you for staying at Hyatt Regency Green Bay, we certainly hope we can change your mind with staying with Hyatt in the future.

2019-09-26 09:49:18] Email received from: Kevin Ryan <jaspers31@aol.com>: Perhaps my expectations were to high. The breakfast buffet was not very impressive in terms of choices French toast was not very good and the eggs were cold when I visited. Also, I would have expected a broader menu then offered at the Sports Bar.  Also selections in the small shop for bringingto room in terms of soft drinks and snacks were limited. All of the staff was very nice and professional.  The hotel seems to be in need of renovation.  Given the price of over $300 when Packers play not at all worth it.  Thank you for your follow up.

Thank you for being our guest recently at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay; as well as for taking the time to fill out the guest satisfaction survey regarding your stay. In addition, thank you for being a loyal World of Hyatt member. I am pleased to see that overall you enjoyed your stay, but apologize for the inconvenience regarding the charge for parking for guests. I also regret that the drafts of Spotted Cow your party ordered were not consistent with the quality of said beer. I truly apologize if it felt as if you were not being listened to during the interaction you had with myself and any other colleagues regarding the feedback you offered about the beer not tasting like Spotted Cow. However, after your party opined that it didn't taste right, the decision was made to change the keg out to ensure taste & quality expectations for our guests, such as yourself, were being fulfilled. I sincerely hope we have the opportunity to serve you as our guest again in the future, so that we may serve you  better than we did this time around. Please let me know if there is anything else regarding your stay I may assist you with.

Thank you for taking the time to complete our Guest Satisfaction survey and sharing your feedback about your check-in experience.

I apologize that the charge amounts for your stay were not acknowledged by our Front Desk Host and verified by you at check-in. I have spoken with the Front Desk Host that checked you in and have made sure that our entire front desk team is verifying charges and/or authorizations to Guest credit cards before any action takes place.  If you would like to change credit cards for your past stay, we can certainly work with you to do that. 

If there is anything else you would like to discuss about your stay with us, please do not hesitate to reach out.

2019-09-25 16:15:14] Email received from: Tom and Patty <tomandpattym@yahoo.com>: Hi RobThanks for the follow up.We never actually saw the full menu.  We arrived at 9:55pm on the first night, and my wife ran in and ordered two bacon cheeseburgers while I checked in.The second night we dined out, but we snacked there during the day, and had dinner there on the third night.  It was just really difficult trying to find something a little more interesting that fried chicken tenders, burgers done three ways etc.and there was nothing appealing on the menu than the sort of food that was available at the stadium.My wife ordered the burger, but contrary to the menu, it was absolutely not a half pound patty, but more like a quarter pound.  She was not particularly hungry, so we didn't say anything as it was more than enough.  Our friend ordered a cobb salad, which was nothing like any cobb salad we have had before, more like a loose collection of mixed greens with a few extra ingredients.  It was not the head of lettuce he was expecting.  Tasted fine, but definitely not a cobb salad.Hope that helps!ThanksTom Muir

Good evening Mr. Paradis, 
Thank you for taking the time to fill out our survey and provide us with feedback about your stay. I’m glad to see you enjoyed the majority of your stay, and am particularly happy you had a great interaction with our outstanding front desk staff.  I noticed, however, you rated your overall food and beverage considerably lower than the rest of your ratings, and was wondering if there was anything specific that you felt was not up to your expectations that you would like to share. We will use any information you provide as a learning experience, and hope to be able surpass your expectations if we have the opportunity to serve you again. If you have any concerns or comments please feel free to contact me at the email below

Good evening Ms. Jenkins,
Thank you for taking the time to fill out our survey and provide us with feedback about your stay. While I’m glad to see you enjoyed the majority of your stay, it appears that you were disappointed in the selection we provide on our breakfast buffet. While we attempt to have a consistently changing and fresh array of foods on our breakfast buffet it seems as though we fell short of your expectations. Thank you for your feedback, as we will use this as teaching experience for our team to improve our performance if we have the opportunity to serve you again.  If you have any other concerns or comments please feel free to contact me at the email below.
Thank you.

I appreciate you taking the time to complete our Guest Satisfaction Survey. Your feedback is invaluable as we continually strive to create a warm and inviting home away from home for our Guests.

I apologize that you found the room in a less than desirable state and that we did not have additional sets of towels in the room for you upon arrival. I have passed along your concerns to the appropriate leadership to that we can meet your expectations in the future. As a goodwill gesture, I have added 8,000 points to your World of Hyatt account. You should see this reflected in 7-10 business days. 

Should you wish to discuss anything else regarding your stay, please do not hesitate to reach out. I hope we have the opportunity to welcome you back to Green Bay in the future. 

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. We appreciate your guest feedback as it is utilized as an opportunity for improvement for our hotel. I apologize about the guest room type not being available for your stay. We try to honor all requests but unfortunately it looks as though it was not available at that time. I have alerted the culinary team regarding your concerns about the prime rib. I thank you for bringing this to our attention so that we may provide the necessary changes so that we may provide top of the line food and beverage at our hotel. Should you find yourself in Hyatt Regency Green Bay again, please inform the front desk for any issues so that we may improve your stay for you. I am sorry that we were not able to assist you to your satisfaction. We hope to welcome you back and provide a better stay for you.

Dear Ms. Jacobson,

I want to thank you for choosing to stay with us and sincerely apologize for the condition your room was in when you checked in. 

I have researched with Housekeeping and we have coached our team to make sure that our rooms are being cleaned appropriately. We have notated your profile of your concerns so that your future stays with us will be more comfortable.

Should have any questions or wish to discuss this further, please do not hesitate to reach out.

However when paying $1016.00 for a two night stay - an update to my profile and coaching your housekeeping staff is really insufficient for us.  The room should have sparkled for that price!
In my opinion a refund of some amount should seriously be issued to us.  I didn’t want to sit on a chair, set anything on the desk (the desk chair had to have MONTHS of dust and crumb build-up on it) much less sleep there but we didn’t really have any choice after spending that kind of money at your hotel.
Thanks for the email - Jackie

Thank you for your response.
I had to do some research today and I’m wondering, did you speak to anyone at the hotel regarding your concerns? Did you allow us the opportunity to move your room or send housekeeping in to deep clean the room for you?
I look forward to your reply.

2019-10-01 08:13:18] Email received from: Jackie Jacobson <jax1414@hotmail.com>: Sorry for the delay in response.  No we did not approach the desk.  We overheard a conversation between employees about the hotel being full - and made an assumption we couldn’t move to another room.   Being Vikings/Packer game we assumed and probably shouldn’t have.
As for asking for a deep clean - we did not.  So I guess the condition of the room was our fault for not saying anything.
It’s unfortunate in all accounts - that your hotel provided a less than desirable room and we failed to discuss with anyone.  I am taking some responsibility for not speaking up and it would be appreciative if the hotel could do the same or some kind of a small refund or something.  I’d like to believe someone inspected the room after our claim and could see how dirty the desk and chairs were.

Dear Mr. Lai,

We appreciate you being a World of Hyatt member and sincerely apologize for the inconveniences you experienced during your stay. 

Looking at the availability for a late checkout during your stay, we did not have the availability to accommodate them and I am following up with my team to make sure that we have a consistent message when assisting Guests. When rooms are assigned, our system does its best to place you in a room that meets all of your preferences. I apologize that you were placed in a room near the elevators. I have updated our system to reflect your request; however, these are internal for the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. For future stays at other Hyatt properties, I do recommend that you update your preferences through your profile to ensure that your requests are met.

As a goodwill gesture for your inconveniences, I am having 5,000 bonus points added to your account. 

Please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions or concerns. 

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for being our guest recently at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay; as well as for providing feedback related to your stay. I apologize that your stay was not as enjoyable as possible due to the issues you experienced with both your room and our breakfast service. I will definitely pass along your comments about the water infiltration to the appropriate departments. Both myself and the other leaders in our Outlets department will utilize the feedback you have provided about your breakfast experience as a coaching opportunity for our team to learn and grow from. It is through feedback from guests such as yourself that enables us to learn and improve throughout our entire property; so that we may better meet our guests' needs in the future.

Thank you for replying with some feedback on what we can improve. Do know we have toilet seat raisers available on request for guests who would like them. We also have higher toilets in our ADA King and ADA Queen Suites, as well as lower beds and a walk in shower. We do appreciate the feedback, and will consider when we do update our hotel and bathrooms.
Thank you, and hope you have a great day.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and thank you for being a World of Hyatt member. We do appreciate your continued loyalty to Hyatt hotels. We are sorry to hear about the miscommunication in regards to a wheel chair being available. Unfortunately, the one we did have was broken beyond repair and have been unable to replace it. We are also sorry to hear about cleanliness issues with the coffee maker in the room. We hope that someone was able to replace it or clean it thoroughly for you. We are also sorry to hear that there were some loud guests in the atrium after the weddings. We normally try to have them moved either into their rooms or to a separate area away from the atrium to limit noise. We try to strive to provide a relaxing environment for our guests and are sorry we were not able to provide that for you. 

We hope to see you again soon at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

Thank you for being our guest recently at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay, and for taking the time to provide us with feedback regarding your stay. I am sincerely sorry that you endured the experience you did with the desk chair in your suite, but am pleased that our colleagues were swift in remedying the situation for you. It appears that we fell short of your food & beverage expectations during your stay, and I am wondering if you would be willing and able to provide me with any details as to how and why we fell short in this area? We utilize feedback such as this from guests like yourself as a way for our team to learn and grow from.

Thank you for being our guest recently at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay; as well as for taking the time to complete the guest satisfaction survey related to your stay. It appears that overall you had an enjoyable stay. However, it seems as if we did not meet your expectations when you dined with us. I am wondering if you would be willing and able to please provide with me any information on how we fell short of your expectations in this area of your stay? We utilize feedback from guests such as yourself as a means to learn and grow from, so that we may better serve our guests in the future. I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience. In addition, please let me know if there is anything else regarding your stay I may assist you with.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. We do appreciate hearing back from our guests on how their stay was. 

We are sorry to hear that your stay did not meet your expectations. Do know that our parking rates are listed on our hotel site under the Map, Parking + Transportation section. Due to this being your first time with us and not expecting that, I did credit off the parking charge and credited the $7 back to your card on file. 

We also appreciate the feedback in regards to the buffet description on our website, and will look into updating this for future guests to cause less confusion with upcoming stays. It does include a wide variety of what is provided, but not all, so we will update with some of the hot offerings with the buffet. 

Thanks again for taking time to complete our survey, and hope you have a great evening.

Thank you for being our guest recently at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay; as well as for taking the time to complete the guest satisfaction survey regarding your stay. It appears that overall, you enjoyed your stay. I can't help but notice that we seemed to have missed the mark with regards to your food & beverage expectations. I am wondering if you would be willing and able to please provide me with any details as to how we fell short in this regard? We utilize feedback from guests such as yourself as opportunities to learn and grow from, so that we may better serve our guests in the future. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. In addition, please feel free to let me know if there is anything else regarding your stay I may assist you with.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and thank you for being a World of Hyatt member. We appreciate your loyalty to Hyatt as your choice of hotel to stay in. We are sorry to hear that we were not able to meet your expectations for you stay. With Hyatt hotels, our Hyatt Regency tend to not include complimentary breakfast or drinks. Do know you can book a bed and breakfast rate to include breakfast in the morning when booking through Hyatt.com or by calling our reservations department. We are sorry to hear that your guest room did not meet your expectations either. We are always trying to find ways to improve our hotel for our guests, and will consider your feedback in what we can do to better our hotel. 

We hope to see you again soon at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

We're sorry to hear that your experience with us did not meet your expectations. We try to make our guests stay as tranquil as possible, and we are sorry to not be able to make that for you. Typically, the room you were in is quiet, but with the lot resurfacing on the 28th of August, it unfortunately was not. Do know in the future if you stay with us again, that if you are not satisfied with your room, please call down to the front desk and we would be happy to move you.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and being an Explorist with us. We do appreciate your continued loyalty to Hyatt. We are sorry to hear about the issues that did occur with your stay. Unfortunately with our hotel, we do have limited parking and have to redirect to the city owned parking garage for overflow parking on nights where we have near full occupancy. Do know that if you do park at the hotel, our normal parking fee is $7 for all guests per night. 
We're also sorry about the miscommunication with breakfast. At our property, as a courtesy, our World of Hyatt Globalist are extended complimentary breakfast, unless they book a rate with breakfast included. If you do stay with us in the future, know there is a bed and breakfast rate that can be booked that will include the breakfast with it. Please feel free to reach out the next time you will stay with us, and I can personally assist with making a reservation to include the breakfast with it. 

We hope to see you again at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for being a World of Hyatt member with us. We do appreciate your loyalty to Hyatt as your choice of place to stay. We are sorry about the issues that you did have with your bathroom. I know I did talk to you about it briefly at check out, and am sorry you did not have time for us to be able to go up and see what had caused the issue. We would have been happy to have engineering go up and take a look at what was causing the blockage of the tub. It turned out the the plug was blocking the drain. Our maintenance team was able to open it and got it to drain. We're sorry for the complications with it. 

We also apologize for the issue with the air conditioner being too loud. I know that cooling system can be a bit finicky. If you do stay with us in the future, please feel free to call down and we will happily have engineering take a look at the fan for the air conditioner in your room, and turn down the fan to a lower speed to reduce the noise. 

We do hope that the rest of your stay was enjoyable, and that you will stay at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay in the future.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. Thank you for being a World of Hyatt member with us. We do appreciate your continued loyalty with Hyatt. We apologize for the inconvenience of the noisy guests in the hall. We strive to provide a tranquil setting for our guests during their stays. We did do our best working with our security team to quiet down the guests the best we could as quickly as possible. I do understand my colleague took off half the room rate for that evening, and hope that was to your satisfaction.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and thank you for being a World of Hyatt member with us. We appreciate your continued loyalty with Hyatt. We're sorry that there was miscommunication at check-in with the breakfast. We strive to provide exceptional service, and will make sure to discuss with our team members to ensure that we are conveying the correct information to guest going forward.  
We also apologize for having issues with parking over the weekend. With weddings, we do direct guests that are not staying at the hotel to the parking ramp for such events, and try to limit if at all possible for those guests to not park in our hotel lot. We know that on busier weekends, we do have to direct some guests to park in the overflow parking. I did see on the reservation that there were still parking charges on there. As a courtesy, I did credit the $14 in parking charges back onto your card, and have emailed you an updated receipt for your records. 
With the pool, we try to ensure that rules are followed as much as possible and are sorry for the issues with the intoxicated guests in the pool area. We try to prohibit drinking in the pool area and only allow for swimming in proper attire. Do know if you do stay with us again and something does occur like this, please reach out to the front desk and we will have security address the situation immediately. The comfort and safety of our guests are our highest concern. 

Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any other questions or concerns. Please use the email below to reach me. 

We hope to see you again at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

We utilize feedback from guests, such as yourself, as a means to continuously evolve throughout our entire property. We will definitely take your feedback about prices in our Market into consideration. I am extremely pleased to see that you found our hotel to be beautiful and were treated well by our colleagues.

counter medications in order to make a few extra dollars.  You made about
$250 on my stay including meals.  How many pepto bismols do you have to
sell to compensate for me not ever staying at a Hyatt again..? i stay in a
hotel up to 5 times a month due to work travel.
Your done screwing me over and delivering s subpar stay,
Angry customer

Thank you for being our guest recently at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay, and for taking the time to complete the guest satisfaction survey regarding your stay. I am pleased to see that you received great service from our front office colleagues, as well our colleagues in our PUB333 Breakfast area. I apologize for the issues you experienced with the carpet and Wi-Fi, and will pass that feedback along to the appropriate departments for follow-up. I am also displeased to see that you received what you considered poor service when you joined us for dinner both nights during your stay. I understand the frustration that can cause.

little disappointed with the overall value. No free parking, no free
breakfast, the suites are pretty small for my family. But the service was
great!

I had a wonderful stay at your hotel and have absolutely no complaints! 
I think you are responding to my answer to the question of whether I believe the staff truly cared about me. I answered it truthfully, but it's not a shortcoming: of course you and your staff don't actually care about me, they don't even know me! You care about providing each of your guests a wonderful stay, but it's not the same as personally caring. I think that question is just poorly worded.
You all do a marvelous job.
Sincerely,
Kate MacGregor

Thank you for being our guest here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay recently; as well as for providing us with feedback about your stay. I am glad you found your stay to be enjoyable overall, but apologize for the issues you encountered with the bedding and feathers. I will relay your comments to the leaders in our Front Desk and Housekeeping departments for coaching opportunities. I am also sorry that the colleagues on our breakfast staff in the Outlets department did not deliver service in a caring manner. I will definitely follow-up with my team members in this regard, so that they may take your feedback and learn and grow from it. And how doing so will allow us to better serve our guests, such as yourself, in the future. I hope we have the opportunity to welcome you as a guest again soon. Please feel free to let me know if there is anything else regarding your stay I may assist you with.

We have nothing but compliments for the hotel staff.,"The hotel and rooms are clean, but the rooms are very dated. Each room should be equipped with a safe. I am not going to go to the front desk to store electronic equipment. The rooms are lacking in adequate storage. For example, I understand the hotel encourages guests to re-use towels. But there is not a single towel rod in the bathroom. I’ve never stayed in a hotel without a single towel rod. There was one hook next to the shower. There were 2 drawers in the bedroom and not a single drawer or cabinet in the bar area. These simple things would allow guests to store their belongings out of site, and perhaps make it easier for the housekeeping staff to clean, thus saving time.",We thought the service in the restaurant was inadequate.,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Control,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,""""",,,,,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the issues experienced in your guest room, including the cleanliness and fridge buzzing noise. I have shared these comments with our Housekeeping and Engineering teams, respectively, so that we may utilize them as coaching opportunities to improve the guest experience. I also apologize for the way the parking situation was handled; unfortunately, we do not have extra tickets at the desk, however, we do have a call button at each exit should the machine malfunction or a ticket is not recognized. The call button will reach us immediately so that we may raise the gate for you. I will certainly discuss this event with my staff so that this situation is handled more tactfully in the future. We do hope to have the pleasure of serving you as our guest in the future, should you find yourself in the Green Bay area.

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any assistance, please feel free to contact me directly.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the noise disturbance, but am also glad that our smoke detectors are in good condition should an emergency arise. For any future stays, we do have fans available that should assist in circulating some air to prevent the alarms from sounding. We do hope to have the pleasure to serve you as our guest again soon, should you find yourself in the Green Bay area.

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any assistance, please feel free to contact me directly.

Best wishes,

The staff at this hotel want to make everyone feel like they are important.,I found our room to be very clean and the hotel in general also very clean. With the size of this hotel (8 floors) one usually sees carts outside of rooms when they are being cleaned as it takes a lot of time to clean all of these rooms and the cleaning staff do an excellent job of it.,"Since I spoke about the Breakfast Buffet I will now concentrate more on the PUB restaurant/bar that is located on the 1st floor. My husband and i have stayed at this hotel many times over the past 10+ years and we have always found good food at the Pub. This time around we had the Chicken Wraps, and one of the salads with grilled Salmon on top. Both were excellent. Staff is very accommodating and work hard to make sure you are getting what you ordered and that you are satisfied with it.",Again I highly recommend staying at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay on Main St. It is definitely worth it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Control,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,""""",,,,,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the issues with room placement. Unfortunately, the room type that was booked is only available in the far corners of each guest floor; however, I will note on your guest profile that you do not prefer those room types based on location, so that we may better suit your needs for future stays. We look forward to having the pleasure of serving you as our guest in the future.

Thank you for taking the time to complete the guest satisfaction survey regarding your recent stay with us a the Hyatt Regency Green Bay, as well as for providing us with feedback related to your stay. I also thank you for being a loyal World of Hyatt member. I am pleased to see that overall you enjoyed your stay. I apologize that we fell short of your expectations in relation to our food & beverage operations. I am wondering if you would be able to provide any additional details regarding the feedback you left related to the service with your coffee, such as day and time, any details about the colleague(s) you interacted with during this time, etc? Information of this nature will allow us to follow-up and utilize your experience as a coaching opportunity for the colleague(s) to learn and grow from, so that we may provide better service to guests such as yourself during future stays. In addition, if there is anything else related to your stay that I may assist you with please let me know.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the issues experienced regarding your room type and the cleanliness of the guest room. I'm delighted to see that the Front Desk was able to compensate you for these difficulties, and we will certainly share your feedback with our Housekeeping leadership as a coaching opportunity. We do hope to have the pleasure to serve you as our guest again soon, should you find yourself in the Green Bay area again.

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any assistance, please feel free to contact me directly.

Thank you for taking the time to complete the guest satisfaction survey regarding your recent stay with us at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay, and for providing us with feedback about your stay. I am pleased to see that you found your stay to be enjoyable overall. And that our colleagues took great care of you while you were our guest. Especially in light of what the storm damage your home incurred. I sincerely hope your home is fully repaired now. I did happen to notice that we might have missed the mark when it came to your dining experience(s) while you were our guest. I am wondering if you would be able and willing to provide any feedback on how we fell short of your expectations in this aspect of your stay? We utilize feedback such as this to learn and grow from, so that we may better serve our guests in the future. I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience. In addition, please feel free to let me know if there is anything else related to your stay I may assist you with.

Thank you for reaching out and taking the time for personalized service.
In this particular case, it was only my wife who had breakfast once.  I,
unfortunately, didn't get the details about what was ""wrong"".  From the
very brief wording I heard, it was just, ""eh, breakfast wasn't really that
great"".  Sorry, I know that isn't very helpful to work off of.  It
certainly wouldn't stop us from coming back again.  The hotel was nice and
all the staff interactions I had were great.
Thanks again and take care Rob.  If there is anything else I can do please
let me know.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the cleanliness issues experienced in your guest room; this certainly does not meet our standards, and has been communicated to our Housekeeping leadership team as a coaching opportunity. I would also like to apologize for the confusion regarding the parking situation. Our $7 parking fee should only be applied if the guest is utilizing a spot in our front lot. As a courtesy, I have refunded all three nights of parking for a total of $21 back to the card on file for your reservation. We would love to have the pleasure to serve you as our guest again soon, should you find yourself in the Green Bay area again.

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me directly.

From giving us ideas on places to go for fun or to eat, to just greeting us with a smile and speaking on the many times we entered and exited... they made this the most memorable stay at a hotel we have ever experienced.   My son already misses the hotel.  This will be our hotel of choice whenever we are in Green Bay.

Also, I think her name is Alora or Aloha with the Hospitality crew.  She made sure our room was always clean and we had what we needed everyday.

Those 3 ladies are awesome!!

Not to be outdone was Katie in providing the best service and being very cordial.  They both made my son and I feel comfortable and welcomed as a guest, not just another customer.  From giving us ideas on places to go for fun or to eat, to just greeting us with a smile and speaking on the many times we entered and exited... they made this the most memorable stay at a hotel we have ever experienced.   My son already misses the hotel.  This will be our hotel of choice whenever we are in Green Bay.

Also, I think her name is Alora or Aloha with the Hospitality crew.  She made sure our room was always clean and we had what we needed everyday.

Those 3 ladies are awesome!!

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the issues experienced with breakfast and the delay in delivery of items to your guest room. These comments have been shared with our Outlets and Housekeeping teams, so that we may utilize this as a coaching opportunity for our colleagues. I'm glad to see that our host was able to take care of a portion of your room rate as a form of recompense. We do hope to have the pleasure to welcome you as our guests again soon, so that we may have another chance to exceed expectations.

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any assistance, please feel free to contact me directly.

Best wishes,

Emma Lee

Good afternoon Ms. Aguilar,

Thank you for being our guest and providing feedback.  I am so sorry to hear that your stay started off on the wrong foot and that the colleague you spoke to was rude.   Please know this is unacceptable and will be addressed through continued training with our Front Office Hosts.  Might you know the name of the colleague that was assisting you?  

Although this got your stay off in a bad direction, I can see form your other comments that everything was satisfactory.  We hope to have you as our guest again soon, so that you can see we have improved and continue to provide first class service.

Warm regards,
Kristine

Thank you for being our guest and responding with feedback.  I apologize the way the staff responded.  We had an unprecedented storm earlier on Saturday and I think the staff was unprepared for the day and reaction to guests.  Please know we have reviewed this day from a complete hotel perspective including communication to keep it from happening again.

We hope to see you again soon as our guest.

Good afternoon Ms. Rose

Thank you for being our guest and responding with feedback.    Please accept my apologies for the inferior service you received in the Pub333 during your stay.  I am shocked that something like this would happen and can assure you that it will be addressed with the management team in Pub333.   It is truly our mission to ""Care for people so they can be their Best"" and I am sorry that you were not cared for.  

Please know I continue to work on service with the staff in the hotel and we will get better.  We hope that next time you visit you see vast improvement.

Warm regards.

Because we only paid around $130 a night I gave it 3 stars. If I had paid more it would have been 2. Our room smelled pleasant and was spacious. (Our friends however had a much smaller room that was the “same” as ours.) Upon arrival there were visible pieces of dirt on the couch—as if someone put their feet up and the dirt fell off of their shoes. When you sat on the couch you could see that no one had vacuumed the crease between the a attached cushion and the actual couch—there were visible crumbs and hair. There was a door separating the sitting area and bed area, which was nice. The bathroom had dirty/stained grout, badly repaired leaks, and no toilet paper or Kleenex. I expect a hotel bathroom to be cleaner and nicer than my bathroom because it should be getting cleaned every other day or so, but this just did not feel that way. The towels and bed linens were not the quality I would expect from a Hyatt, but they weren’t awful. The “comforter” was a thin, deflated, down comforter covered with a plain white sheet. But it was clean. The bed was not comfortable for me or my spouse. I did appreciate the wet bar with fridge and microwave. I also liked that it came with a separate makeup mirror that you could move to a table and sit to do your makeup. Overall it was okay. We got what we paid for.",,4,3,1,2,4,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,22,,Test,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,""""",,,,,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thank you for taking the time to complete the guest satisfaction survey regarding your recent stay at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay, as well as for being a World of Hyatt member! It was an honor and an enjoyable experience for all of our colleagues to host the Western Fraternal group, and we are definitely hoping to see all of you again in 4 years---if not sooner! I will pass along your comments regarding the buffet being cold to our Culinary and Banquet/Event Services leaders, so that they may utilize your feedback as a coaching opportunity for their respective teams. Please feel free to contact me at the email or phone number below if there is anything else regarding your stay I may assist you with.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the miscommunication that occurred with breakfast at our property. We do have a room rate available that does include breakfast, and we do offer a Care Package at time of check-in that does include breakfast for 2, parking, a $5 food & beverage credit, and premium internet for a total of $25. As a separate charge, our breakfast buffet is $12.95 for adults. However, I do hope that the rest of your stay was delightful, and if you find yourself in the Green Bay area again soon, we hope to have the opportunity to serve you as our guest.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. It appears we may have missed the mark in a couple of areas during your stay, for which I sincerely apologize. I was wondering if you had any additional feedback you may be able to provide us with, so that we may learn and grow from the errors that were made. I hope to hear from you soon!

Thank you for taking the time to complete the guest satisfaction survey related to your recent stay with us here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am glad to see that you received excellent customer service during your stay. I do see that we see to have missed the mark in a few areas, notably in your food & beverage experience. I am wondering if you would be willing and able to please elaborate on how we fell short of your expectations in this area while you were our guest? We utilize feedback such as this as priceless information for our colleagues and teams to learn and grow from. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. I also hope we have the opportunity to serve you as our guest again soon!

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. We appreciate your guest feedback and World of Hyatt membership. I apologize for any confusion in regards to your billing. No damages were found in the room; however, there are a couple incidental charges, such as parking and a Market item. I have sent you a receipt to your email that reflect these charges. I hope this clears up any miscommunication or confusion regarding your receipt. Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns and I would be happy to assist you.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for any miscommunication regarding charges on your guest room. Upon reviewing your folio, I see just room & tax charges for the amount of $559.04. Parking charges had been adjusted off due to your vehicle being parked in the ramp. Any incidental holds are released by the hotel on the day of check-out, and may take 1-3 business days to reflect on your account depending on your financial institution. However, I'm delighted to see that you enjoyed most of your stay, and hope to see you at next year's Kitsune Kon!

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any assistance, please don't hesitate to contact me directly.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the issues experienced with the cleanliness of our linens, and the wait experienced. This has been addressed with our Housekeeping staff as a coaching opportunity, and I'm glad that the linens were changed out for you. I'm also delighted to see that you enjoyed the rest of your stay with us; we are always honored to host Kitsune Kon, and hope to see you again next year!

And the front desk and house keeping were super helpful in getting my lost item back to me.,"My guest room was great, it was weird that there were no bags in the garbage but I understand that is probably done to cut down on plastic waste with I appreciate. My only complaint about the room is not being able to see a layout or even more than one photo before hand. My major complaint would be the elevators, they are in desperate need of an update. The convention I was a part of at the hotel brought in 3400 people and while I know some didn't stay at the hotel I know many did, and with 8 floors and so many people needing to go up and down all the time the wait time got crazy at some points.","We had lunch at about 11:30am on Friday July 12th in the pub. My chicken strips were good but $12-$15 for 3 strips and some fries was a little ridiculous. One of the other people at my table had the mac and cheese and was less than impressed, again it was expensive, the portion was small, and the sauce was an off texture. The other 2 at my table enjoyed their pulled pork quesadilla and burger, but again the price compared to the portions left much to be desired. We didn't send back the mac and cheese because we had waited so long for the food to come out the in the first place (a believe 30-45min) that we would have missed the start of our event if we waited again. Our waitress was great but we will probably not be returning again. We did also have the breakfast buffet 2 of the mornings of our stay and it was great, though the french toast on Sunday was very overcooked.",I don't think it really made any difference.,,,Closed,"2019-07-15 14:59:44] Alert Created: Overall F&B Experience: Overall F&B Experience;

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I apologize that you were uncomfortable in your guest room. We do the best we can to make our guests comfortable while maintaining the structural integrity of the historical downtown building, including the heating and cooling system running throughout, and we are disappointed that we missed the mark during your stay. We have made note of this on your profile, so that regardless of which Hyatt property you may be staying with, we can try to make your guest room as cool as possible for your arrival. We enjoyed having the LPGA group stay with us, and we hope to see everyone again soon!

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any assistance, please don't hesitate to contact me directly.

Best wishes,

Emma Lee

Thank you for completing the guest satisfaction survey regarding your recent stay with us here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay; as well as for being a loyal World of Hyatt member. It appears that overall you enjoyed your stay with us. However, I noticed you rated your food & beverage experience on the lower side relatively speaking. I am wondering if you would be willing and able to please let me know where/how we missed the mark in this regard? We will utilize your feedback as an opportunity to learn and grow from as a team, and better serve our guests in the future. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for taking time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. We truly appreciate your World of Hyatt membership and guest feedback. I apologize for the issue that occurred during your stay, especially the TV not working in the guest room. I see that our Engineering team tried to fix this issue, however led to moving rooms. I hope that the new room was much better and that we were able to get a working TV for you. Additionally, I apologize for the quality of the breakfast buffet and if it was less than satisfactory. We just recently updated our menu at Pub333, the Market, and our breakfast buffet; we hope that you give us another chance to welcome you back and try our new menu.

We are pleased that you had a positive food and beverage experience. We just recently updated our menu at Pub333 and The Market and I hope you have the chance to try it the next time you're in Green Bay. I apologize about the mold issue that was experienced in the guest room as this is certainly something we want to prevent for any future stays. I am glad that our Engineering team was able to take care of it right away and we hoped that you enjoyed the amenity as well! Thank you for your feedback as it is utilized as a training and coaching opportunity for all areas of our hotel. We certainly hope to welcome you back to Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

Thank you so much for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the issues experienced in our parking lot; please know that we do not allow any boats or trailers in our front lot in consideration of our guests, and the vehicle that illegally parked was appropriately ticketed. However, if a guest needs to utilize overflow parking, located in the Main Street Parking Ramp, we are more than happy to remove the $7 nightly parking fee, as that fee is only applicable to guests who are parked in our lot overnight. However, I do hope the rest of your stay was enjoyable, and we hope to see you again soon!

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any assistance, please feel free to contact me directly.

I would like extend my sincere apologies for the billing mishap you experienced after leaving the property.  At the time of your checkout, there were no breakfast charges and I was able to provide the correct receipt.  Unfortunately, the breakfast charge was posted after you left and was not adjusted correctly before closing.  The charge was reversed immediately and I am sorry for the troubles this error caused.  I sent an updated copy of your receipt for your records to view the correction that was made.  The billing error was an honest mistake and I am sorry that you were affected by it.  Please feel free to contact me directly should you need any assist and I hope you have a wonderful holiday.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. In accordance with most Hyatts, we do have nominal fees associated with both early check-ins and late check-outs. We do try to make these fees as reasonable as possible for our guests, and are always looking for new ways to improve the guest experience. We do hope to have the opportunity to have you as our guest again soon, should you ever find yourself in the Green Bay area.

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any assistance, please feel free to contact me directly.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the issues experienced during your stay. Our coolers are marked as such just for the safety of our guests, as the smaller units unfortunately cannot reach as cold of temperatures as full-sized refrigerators; we want to ensure that guests with medications or other items that may need to be stored at a very specific temperature are aware of the limitations of the coolers. I also appreciate your feedback regarding the difficulty closing the cooler door, and will certainly pass this along to our Engineering team for further review. I apologize for the colleague at the Front Desk who was unsure about our Bed and Breakfast rate; I will utilize this as a coaching opportunity with our colleagues to ensure we are able to provide thorough, accurate information to our guests. We do hope to have the opportunity to serve you as our guest again, so that we may have a second chance to provide an excellent experience for you.

If you have any further questions, or if I can be of any assistance, please feel free to contact me directly.

Best wishes,

Emma Lee

Thank you for choosing to stay with us at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay recently. And for taking the time to fill out your guest experience survey. It appears we missed the mark on your dining experience during your stay. I am wondering if you would be willing to elaborate on why we fell short of your expectations when you dined with us? Feedback such is this is priceless as we are able to learn and grow directly from our guests' experiences. I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience. And hope you will give us an opportunity to serve you as a guest again soon.

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. We appreciate your guest feedback and for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am pleased to see that you had a great stay overall and a positive customer service experience! I am sorry if you experienced any issues with noise in the atrium or near your guest room. We enforce quiet hours from 9PM- 6AM and I apologize if it did not seem quiet at this time. I have added a note on your profile for a quieter room, and away from the elevators for future stays so that you may have a tranquil guest room environment. Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any additional concerns and if I can be of further assistance for future stays.

Thank you for staying with us during the SNA conference, for being a loyal World of Hyatt member, as well  as taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay. I am glad to see that overall it appears you enjoyed your stay, and apologize for the less than enjoyable experience you had while our guest in PUB333 during your stay. We will definitely utilize your feedback to learn and grow from so that we may better serve our guests in similar situations in the future. I am wondering if you would be able to elaborate on your comment about ""closed early"" per chance? I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience.. We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back as a guest again soon.

2019-07-01 09:41:56] Email received from: Amy Fisher <fishera@springvalley.k12.wi.us>: Hi Mr. Peterson,
On Monday night, 6-24-19, there were about 15 people in the PUB333 and one
of our brokers there with his credit card open. The bartender told everyone
it was last call. The man with the credit card, mysefl and others tryed to
get another drink after this and the bartender said no. I was probably
about midnight. Like I said in my comments, this is our one night out and
we are all working adults. I understand that Mondays are not the typical
""night out"" but this was our night out and there was a good number of
people still willing to stay out.
Thank you for checking into this further.

Thank you for staying with us during the SNA conference, for being a loyal World of Hyatt member, as well  as taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay. I am glad to see that overall it appears you enjoyed your stay, and am sorry to see you did not have a favorable experience during the continental breakfast for your group. I will relay your feedback about this to both our Culinary and Banquets teams so that they may both utilize your feedback as a coaching opportunity for their respective teams. We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back as a guest again soon.

2019-07-01 19:08:52] Email received from: Cindy Jensen <cindy.jensen@nbexcellence.org>: Hi Rob.
Thank you for your follow-up.  Another issues that I didn't know about
until after I completed the survey was brought to my attention.  I had made
the reservation but the person I was sharing the room with arrived before I
did and needed to provide their credit card.  When I checked out (which I
did at the front desk) I made sure that my credit card was charged for the
room.  I was told the other card had been taken out of the system.
However, we both got charged for the room.  We called and got the situation
corrected.  But I thought I had taken steps to avoid this.

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. We appreciate your World of Hyatt loyalty and guest feedback. Parking in our lot is $7 overnight; however it is complimentary with your group rate. We do not validate Main Street Parking Ramp tickets, and it is self-pay.  I apologize if the parking instructions was not addressed to you during your stay with us.  If you parked at the front lot and paid in our gates. Please feel free to contact me directly or email me below so we can refund the $32 parking lot fee. We appreciate your response and look forward to speaking with you soon.

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. We appreciate your World of Hyatt loyalty and guest feedback. I am so sorry about the issues you experienced, especially the inadequate spaces for parking in the front lot. With the KI Convention Center adjacent to the hotel, this allows our lot to fill up faster on busier nights for the attendees. Parking is $7 for overnight in the front lot and is reduced for hotel guests. Parking is complimentary with your group rate; however we do not validate tickets in the Main Street Parking Ramp as it is owned and operated by the City of Green Bay. Additionally, I apologize about the guest room cleanliness and if this impacted your overall stay. Please know that we have addressed these issues so that we can improve future stays. If you have any additional questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me directly.

The lack of variety in the in-room dining options was the most frustrating

Pub and include an a la cart/appetizer section, it would help.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. We value your loyalty to Hyatt as a World of Hyatt member, and appreciate your patronage at our hotel. I sincerely apologize for the issues experienced with staff at our property; I was wondering if you had any additional details you could provide me with, so that we may look into and resolve these issues with our colleagues. We strive to provide excellent service to each guest, and it is very clear that we have missed the mark during your stay. We do hope to have the opportunity to serve you as our guest again soon, so that I may personally ensure an excellent stay for you. 

I look forward to any additional feedback you may be able to provide; thank you in advance for your time.

Thank you for being our guest recently at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay, and for providing us with feedback about your stay. I am glad to see that overall you enjoyed your stay.

Thank you for being our guest during the United Methodist Church Annual Conference this past weekend.  I am glad to see that overall you enjoyed your stay. I am, however, sorry that we missed the mark on your dining experience in PUB333. Our food & beverage teams will utilize this experience as a learning opportunity to grow from. We hope that we have the opportunity serve you again as a guest. We definitely hope you will stay with us again next year for the 2020 Annual Conference!

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. We appreciate your World of Hyatt membership and guest feedback. I sincerely apologize about the issues that occurred. With our hotel at full capacity with conferences and guest rooms, the best available overflow parking spots would be the Main Street Parking Ramp and I apologize if this required you to walk further than anticipated. Additionally, I apologize about not being able to get a late check out, as we unfortunately had a big turn for rooms that day. Please know that your feedback has been addressed with our team so that we can utilize it as a coaching and training opportunity. We look forward to welcoming you back to Hyatt Regency Green Bay next year. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. We appreciate your World of Hyatt membership and guest feedback. I sincerely apologize about the issues that occurred, especially the inadequate spaces for parking in the front lot. With our hotel at full capacity with conferences and guest rooms, the best available overflow parking spots would be the Main Street Parking Ramp and I apologize if this required you to walk further than anticipated. Additionally, I apologize about your front desk experience and if I had missed mentioning the $25 incidental fee. Please know that your feedback has been addressed with our team so that we can utilize it as a coaching and training opportunity. We look forward to welcoming you back to Hyatt Regency Green Bay next year. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. We appreciate your World of Hyatt membership and guest feedback. I am pleased that you had a great stay overall, however it looks like we missed a mark with customer service. I was wondering if you would be able to provide for details about your experience? We try our best to deliver great service in all areas of our hotel even during busy days. Our Pub333 provides a full menu and serves from 11a.m.- 10p.m. for lunch and dinner along with our Market that serves 24 hours grab-and- go items. We hope you have a chance to try local restaurants in Downtown Green Bay the next time you are in town, the front desk would be happy to recommend great suggestions. We appreciate your response and look forward to welcoming you back to Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

Our only real problem with the food was with a salad we got at about the time we checked in on Wednesday.  It was partially frozen so relatively inedible.  When I alerted the staff, I was assured we would be refunded the cost, but that was not done until I raised the issue again at checkout.  It was also frustrating to be stuck and unable to move in our vehicle under the awning due to rain and people leaving their car unattended blocking the exit.  A sign or two might be very helpful.  Otherwise, your staff was very friendly and helpful.

Greetings Mr. Pastron,

Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback from your recent stay and for choosing Hyatt Regency Green Bay.  I am sorry we were not able to provide late checkouts upon your departures.  Late check is based on availability; due to our occupancy levels we were not able to grant extended departures.  With the general session ending at 3PM, it would not be possible to prepare rooms for arriving guests if late check-outs were available.  We do our best to offer late check-outs and to have our rooms ready for new arrivals.  It is unfortunate that it was not available during your stay.  Please do not hesitate to inquire for late check-out availability should it be needed during your next stay.  I hope the conference was a success and you enjoyed your time with us.  Thank you again for choosing to stay with us and feel free to contact us should you need any assistance.

Warm Regards,

We do our best to offer late check-outs and to have our rooms ready for new arrivals.  It is unfortunate that it was not available during your stay.  Please do not hesitate to inquire for late check-out availability should it be needed during your next stay.  I hope the conference was a success and you enjoyed your time with us.  Thank you again for choosing to stay with us and feel free to contact us should you need any assistance.
Warm Regards,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for any miscommunication regarding the billing on your reservation. I did go back and take a look at the guest room folios under your name. I do see each of them were billed to three different cards. It is possible that the duplicate charge you're seeing is the pre-authorization that happens at check in, which will go back on the card for you. It looks like the final amount charged to your Visa was $286.44. If within a few business days there are still discrepancies, please give us a call at 920.432.1234 ext. 0, we are happy to work with you to fix any mistakes made. We will also utilize this as a coaching opportunity for our staff members to avoid future confusion. However, I do hope the rest of your stay was pleasant, and we hope to see you again soon!

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any assistance, please feel free to contact me directly.

Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I will share your comments about the towel racks with our Rooms team. It appears we also missed the mark on your dining experience during your stay. I am wondering if you would be willing and able to please let me know how/why we fell short in this area, so that we may learn and grow as a team?

Your Hyatt hotel is quite nice and comfortable except for the couple of things I stated in my feedback.  Regarding breakfast,  the only real problem we had was on check-in we were told that breakfast was served until 10 a.m.  Since we arrived late, we slept in and arrived for breakfast at 9:40, only to find them clearing it all away.  We asked and were told breakfast was served until 9:30.
If we ever have an opportunity to be back in Green Bay we would probably stay at the Hyatt again.

I sincerely apologize for the delay experienced when checking in to your guest room.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the cleanliness issues in your guest room, and for the issue with the phone. I will certainly pass along your comments to our Housekeeping and Engineering teams, so that we may resolve these issues and utilize them as coaching opportunities for our staff members to prevent future situations such as this one. We do hope to have the opportunity to serve you as our guest again soon, so that we may have a second chance to provide an excellent experience.

Thank you for being our guest recently here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. As well as for taking the time to fill out your guest survey. It appears we missed the mark on your dining experience during your stay. I am wondering if you would be able to please provide me with any information on why you rated this area as you did? Any feedback you are able to pass along will enable us to learn and grow from your experience. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience.

This is not typical of our hotel, and we have utilized this situation as a coaching opportunity to improve our performance for similar days in the future.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the delay experienced when checking in to your guest room. This is not typical of our hotel, and we have utilized this situation as a coaching opportunity to improve our performance for similar days in the future. We certainly understand that our guests' time is valuable, and take this matter very seriously. I do see the host extended breakfast for you; I know this cannot give back the time that was lost, but I am glad to see that we were able to take care of those charges. We do hope to have the opportunity to serve you as our guest again, to have another chance to provide an excellent experience.

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any assistance, please don't hesitate to contact me directly.

Best wishes,

Emma Lee

Thank you for being our guest recently at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for providing the feedback about your stay. I apologize that we missed the mark on your dining experience, as well as for the issues that you encountered with parking and the faucet in your room. Would you be willing to please provide any specifics on what you ordered from PUB333 so that we can use your dining experience as a coaching opportunity for our Culinary team? I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the issues you experienced while staying with us. I do understand how frustrating the parking issue can be, and appreciate your suggestions. We are always actively looking for ways to improve the guest experience, and look forward to the opportunity to have you as our guest again. Please know that you were certainly not placed in poor locations intentionally; our rooms are generally not preassigned, and are automatically assigned at check-in. We do our best to match this up with guest preferences, but unfortunately on sold-out nights like the one the evening you stayed, we cannot always move things around much. To remedy this in the future, I have added a comment to your profile that you prefer higher floors with a view. However, I do hope you enjoyed the rest of your stay with us, and we hope to see you again soon!

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any assistance, please feel free to contact me directly.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. The rate was higher this year due to higher occupancy; there were many events occurring, including a concert at Lambeau, which did drive up demand and prices subsequently. We do the best we can to provide a price that is both fair and reflective of the market in Green Bay. We do hope to see you again next year for the Bellin Run.

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any assistance, please feel free to contact me directly.

Best wishes,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. It appears we may have missed the mark on your food & beverage experience with us. I was wondering if you had any additional details you may be able to provide me with, so that we may rectify any issues experienced and utilize the situation as a coaching opportunity. I look forward to hearing from you, and hope the rest of your stay was a delightful one!

2019-06-05 04:18:01] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good morning Mr. Matenaer,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I apologize that you didn't enjoy your stay with us. We did attempt to extend pool hours for the baseball teams, but due to designated adult swim hours, we did need to clear the pool at the request of other guests. We try our best to create a welcoming and tranquil environment for all guests regardless of what brings them to our hotel, which does include quiet hours, though conversely we do proudly offer games for families during the day on weekends, as well as our pool area every day from 5 AM-10 PM for anyone under 18. However, we do hope that if you find yourself in the Green Bay area again, that we will have the opportunity to serve you as our guest again.

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any assistance, please feel free to contact me directly.

Best wishes,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. It appears we may have missed the mark on your food & beverage experience with us. I was wondering if you had any additional details you may be able to provide me with, so that we may rectify any issues experienced and utilize the situation as a coaching opportunity.

2019-06-10 08:26:21] Email received from: Simon Tim <timsimon75@ameritech.net>: Hi Emma,
This was the fourth year in a row staying there.We enjoyed our stay. I gave the low marks on the food because of our experience at breakfast.We went to breakfast on Saturday morning. The omelet cook left before breakfast was over. So we could not get our omelet. Also, the drink service was very slow, even though there were not many people. We had to stand up and track the servers down to get coffee, water and juice. Because of this, we choose to go somewhere else for breakfast on Sunday.
ThanksTim

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. Thank you for bringing the temperature issues to our attention, and I apologize for the hot tub not being warm enough. Our Engineering team does monitor the temperature, and on occasion with guests going back and forth between cool pool water and the hot tub, the temperature can drop despite the equipment functioning properly. However, I do hope that you enjoyed the rest of your stay, and we hope to see you again soon!

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I apologize for the lackluster service from our Breakfast staff; I will certainly pass along these comments to our Outlets management team so that we may utilize this as a coaching opportunity for our staff members. I'm delighted to see that Kristin was able to take care of you at the Front Desk, and from this experience we aim to improve the guest experience so that we do not disappoint our guests for future stays. I also sincerely apologize for the issues you experienced with the thermostat in your guest room. Our Engineering staff will take a look at the unit right away to ensure it is functioning appropriately. However, I do hope you enjoyed the rest of your stay, and we hope to have the opportunity to serve you as our guest again soon!

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any assistance, please feel free to contact me directly.

Best wishes,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for the shout-out you gave me! It was a delight having you stay with us, and I hope we get to see you again soon. I did want to inquire though, it looks like we may have missed the mark on your food & beverage experience; I was wondering if you had any additional details you may be able to provide us with, so that I may pass your comments along to our Culinary and Outlets teams for improvement. 

I look forward to hearing from you, and hope you had a delightful weekend!

I thank you for leaving the feedback that you did regarding your recent stay with us here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. While it looks like overall you enjoyed your stay, we definitely seemed to have missed the mark with your dining experience. I am wondering if you would be willing and able to please provide any details (day/time, server(s), bartender(s), issue(s) experienced, etc) about your dining experience? Any information will assist me with coaching my team members so that we can grow from the missteps they made during your experience. I look forward to hearing back from you, and hope that we are able to serve you as a guest again soon.

2019-05-30 15:57:29] Email received from: Debra Halbman <dhalbman@att.net>: I was in the bar on Friday May 24. I was with my husband three adult children and my grandson. My grandson is 16 and we were told that he could not be in the bar area. We stated that his mother was with us and we thought in Wisconsin he could at least sit with us. He was not drinking naturally. We were in town for a funeral and it was a very emotional day. When my husband made the query about him just sitting with us, the female bartender told us he had to get out and she was going to call security. My grandson left by himself and went to his room by himself. I just feel it could have been handled in a more sensible manner

2019-05-30 16:09:31] Email received from: Debra Halbman <dhalbman@att.net>: An additional point. My adult children, one who is a Major in the Marines, also spent Saturday night .  They watched the Bucks game and probably would have done so at the hotel, but they chose another sports bar in town based on the experience on Friday. So the female bartender cost the Hyatt business. This was not a group of rabble rousers but a family spending quality time together. 
My daughter also works for Associated Bank and recommended the Hyatt. But she may not in the future.

The air conditioner never became any cooler than 71 degrees. Apparently there was something wrong with the air-conditioning. They did however provide me with a fan. It's unfortunate we had multiple rooms in use but only one fan could be provided.

In the past we have had great experiences at your property and that's why we continue to rebook. Perhaps these were just isolated issues.

I would like to make a note that the staff was absolutely outstanding. I did voice all of my concerns and each time.  They were sincerely apologetic and tried to accommodate and rectify the situations. I understand that there's only so much they could do.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the issues you experienced during your stay, and will certainly pass along the feedback regarding breakfast to our Outlets and Culinary teams to utilize as a coaching opportunity. Regarding the coolers in the guest rooms, we do carry the same model in each guest room, and we do use the terminology cooler as it does not have the ability to reach the same temperature as a full fridge would be. However, we do have full sized refrigeration units available in our kitchen areas that we can store items for guests in upon request. We will certainly utilize this feedback to learn from our mistakes and continue to improve the guest experience. I appreciate you bringing all of this to our attention, and we do hope to see you again soon!

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any assistance, please don't hesitate to contact me directly.

Best wishes,

Emma Lee

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the noise disturbance you experienced from a pet during your stay. Please know that we have a Security staff member on continuously to assist with these issues. While they do regular rounds of the guest floors, we do occasionally miss noise occurrences if they are not happening as our officer walks past; if something similar should occur during a future stay, our Front Desk is happy to dispatch an officer to quiet the guest room causing the disturbance if we are notified. However, I do hope that the rest of your stay was enjoyable, and we hope to have the opportunity to serve you as our guest again soon.

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any assistance, please feel free to contact me directly.

Best wishes,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I apologize for the issues you experienced during your stay with us; I will certainly pass along your comments to our Engineering and Culinary teams, so that we may utilize this situation as a coaching opportunity. We did recently replace all mattresses in the hotel, so I will also have our Housekeeping team investigate to see what the issue may be with the difference in beds in the guest room you occupied. We appreciate you bringing these items to our attention, and hope that if you find yourself in the Green Bay area, we may have the opportunity to serve you as our guest again.

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any assistance, please feel free to contact me directly.

We have the honor of being one of the oldest buildings in the downtown area, and strive to maintain the integrity of the building while providing satisfactory rooms for our guests as well. We do hope to have the opportunity to serve you as our guest again soon, so that we may have a second chance to provide an excellent experience for you.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the issues you experienced with temperature in your guest room. Guest comfort is certainly our top priority, and it is regrettable that we missed the mark during your stay. We have an Engineer on property at all times, and we are always happy to send someone to the guest rooms to assist as needed. I do see our host Danielle also noted that there was a family emergency causing the stay to be cut short, we do hope everything has been happily resolved. We look forward to having the opportunity to serve you as our guest again soon, so that we may have a second chance to provide an excellent experience for you.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the noise issues you experienced during your stay. The Cellcom race was occurring during the weekend of the wedding you had attended, and we will certainly use this as a coaching opportunity for the future to ensure our guests are well-informed about any events in the area that may disrupt sleep. However, I do hope you enjoyed the rest of your stay, and we hope to have the opportunity to serve you as our guest again soon.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the misinformation that was delivered upon check-in; we will utilize this situation as a coaching opportunity for our Front Desk colleagues. Unfortunately, due to limited downtown parking and the ramp being a city-owned structure, we are unable to validate passes from the Main Street parking facility. However, we do appreciate your comments, and I will pass them along to our leadership team for further consideration. I do hope you enjoyed the rest of your stay, and we hope to see you again soon!

I was told at check-in that the city parking ramp ticket would be validated!  The other problem is, even though the Hyatt surface lot is full, there is no notification upon entering that the lot is full, so you end up getting a ticket and then to get out of the lot to find additional parking, you have to go inside the hotel to get your ticket validated!

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the state of your guest room upon arrival, and for the unsatisfactory follow up. Certainly none of what you're describing meets our standards for cleanliness of our guest rooms, and I would appreciate any photos you have taken of the guest room, so that I may pass them along to our Executive Housekeeper. I can be reached at the email listed below. In addition, to compensate you for the unsatisfactory experience, I would like to extend 5K World of Hyatt points - I noticed you are not currently a member, however, with your permission I would like to enroll you and deposit those points in your account. They can be used at any Hyatt property for free award nights, food & beverage, or spa treatments (where applicable). I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. It appears we may have missed the mark on a few areas during your stay, primarily your check-in experience.

Thank you for taking the time to provide valuable feedback regarding your stay.  I would like to welcome you to World of Hyatt and thank you for becoming a member.  I understand your disappoint in not obtaining points for your previous stay; however, third party reservations are not eligible for points.  Your membership gives you access to discounted rates for future bookings and you will receive points with all Hyatt bookings.  I am sorry you were not informed of the parking charge during your first stay with us or missed the signage upon entry.  For guest convenience, we provide a discounted rate of $7 for overnight parking with in and out privileges; whereas, the garage connected via skywalk charges hourly with $8.25 maximum charge for single entry.  We do our best to communicate parking needs upon check-in and I apologize for this being overlooked.  Our housekeeping staff has been made aware of the sheer that was missing your room and have replaced it.  Thank you for choosing to stay with us when you find yourself in Green Bay and please let me know if you need any future assistance.

Good afternoon Ms. Brunner,
Thank you for taking the time to fill out our survey and provide us with feedback about your stay. I see you had an experience with Pub and breakfast food that did not live up to your expectations. While we always strive to provide fresh, hot, and good tasting food we seem to have missed the mark with your meals.  I am disappointed to hear of your cold chili and disappointing breakfast experience, we will use this as teaching experience for my team to improve our performance if we have the opportunity to serve you again.  If you have any other concerns or comments please feel free to contact me at the email below.
Thank you. 

Sincerely,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback.

I also regret to hear that you were unable to retrieve the complimentary coffee offered to you. In lieu of that, I am certainly happy to offer a Food & Beverage credit during any future stay with us. We hope to have the opportunity to serve you as our guest again soon, please let me know if you have plans to return to the Green Bay area so I can ensure a satisfactory stay for you.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I'm delighted to see that you enjoyed most of your stay, however, it appears we may have missed the mark with your Food & Beverage experience. I was wondering if you had any details you may be able to provide me with, so that we may work on rectifying any issues that came up during your stay. 

I look forward to hearing from you!

I would like to thank you for comments and suggestions regarding the layout and structure of the guestrooms.  Feedback such as yours helps us gather information on improvements that can be made when looking to renovate the hotel.  Being an older building, it is difficult to work with the bathroom space that was created at the time of construction but items such as towel racks or hooks is a great suggestion.  Our custom king suites and executive suites do feature a larger bathroom and may be more appealing for your comfort.  I hope your stay was overall enjoyable and appreciate you choosing to stay with us.  Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance and we hope you think of again when returning to Green Bay.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the issues you experienced both with the fan in your guest room, and for the situation with your charger. I will certainly have Engineering take a look at the fan in the guest room so that we may rectify that issue. However, I am concerned with the response you received regarding your charger - I do agree, that is unacceptable. I wanted to inquire whether the charger was retrieved for you after that exchange, or if you have had contact with our team since your departure?

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the many issues you experienced with us during your stay. I do agree, the issues described are unacceptable, and on behalf of our hotel I express regret and our sincerest apologies for the unsatisfactory stay; none of what you described meets the standards we've set for ourselves. Please know that these situations have all been addressed with our colleagues as coaching opportunities, so that we may strive to learn and grow from our mistakes. We do hope to have the opportunity to have you as our guest again, so that we may have a second chance to provide an excellent experience.

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any assistance, please feel free to contact me directly.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the issues you experienced with our parking lot and HVAC system. I will certainly have our Engineering team look into the thermostat issue in the guest room you occupied, I regret that we weren't able to make you more comfortable during your stay. We will also be utilizing the parking situation as a coaching opportunity for our Security staff members; we take accessibility very seriously, and illegally parked cars between accessible parking spots is unacceptable. We appreciate you bringing this to our attention, and hope to see you again soon so that we may have another chance to provide an excellent experience for you. 

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any assistance, please feel free to contact me directly.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I apologize for any miscommunication; as we discussed at the desk, I did put in a request for 5K points to be distributed into your account to start your relationship with Hyatt off on the correct foot. You should see these points reflected within a few business days. I'm delighted to see that you enjoyed the rest of your stay, and we hope to see you again soon!

Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions regarding the World of Hyatt program or any future reservations.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the experience you had in room 207; please know that our staff have addressed this issue immediately, however, I wish we had been able to resolve this for you during your time with us. Unfortunately, we were sold out during the conference you were attending, but guest comfort is our top priority and I regret that we weren't able to make this stay optimal for you. We do hope to see you again soon, so that we may have another opportunity to provide an excellent experience.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our survey and provide us with feedback about your stay. I see you had an experience with banquet function food that did not live up to your expectations. While we always try to provide fresh, clean, good tasting food we seem to have missed the mark with your meal.   I agree that the finding of an insect in your meal is unacceptable, we will use this as teaching experience for my team to improve our performance if we have the opportunity to serve you again.  If you have any other concerns or comments please feel free to contact me at the email below.
Thank you.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I'm delighted to see that you enjoyed most of your stay, including the pillows! Unfortunately, all of our bedding, from mattress to pillows, are made exclusively for Hyatt hotels, so they are not available for purchase in retail outlets. However, we hope to see you again soon for another good night's sleep! I also wanted to inquire about an area of your survey that it appears we missed the mark on; I noticed that it was indicated that the guest room was not up to cleanliness standards. I was hoping you could provide me with some details so that we may look into this and use the situation as a coaching opportunity for our Housekeeping colleagues. I look forward to hearing from you!

Yes, when I got to my room, there was a dirty, wet washcloth hanging on the shower rod.
It was gross.
I called the front desk, house keeping came up checked to make sure the bathroom was clean and took it with them. I was asked if I wanted to change rooms,  I declined.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I apologize for the lack of plant-based meal options, and we certainly appreciate you bringing this to our attention. We are in the process of rolling out a new menu for our guests, and will take this into consideration while we do so. However, I'm delighted to see that you enjoyed the rest of your stay, and we hope to see you again soon!

We strive to learn from our mistakes and continuously improve ourselves and our facilities for our guests, and any feedback you may have is extremely valuable. We hope you give us another chance to welcome you back to Hyatt Regency Green Bay and we look forward to your response.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. We do appreciate the suggestion for the complimentary breakfast, and I will pass this along to our Leadership team for further consideration. I also noticed that we may have missed the mark in your guest room, with some items not in working order. I was wondering if you have any additional details you may be able to provide regarding items that were not working, so that our Engineering may look into repairing these items. I look forward to hearing from you, and we hope to see you again soon!

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the issues you experienced during your stay. I will certainly pass these comments along to our leadership teams, so that we may utilize them as coaching opportunities for our staff members, and can continue to improve the guest experience. For those who are not big breakfast eaters, we are happy to offer a la carte options if the full buffet is not preferred. We do hope to see you again soon, so that we may have another opportunity to provide an excellent experience for you.

I ate at 6:15 on 5/8/19 at the 333 Main Street restaurant.
I had a chilli and a cheeseburger that was supposed to be well done, but was slightly pink. 
I became severely ill by 1:30 in the morning and was sick for the rest of the day into Friday.
My colleague who also traveled with me became ill that morning. She ate the risotto.
Thanks

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I do see that the charge for guaranteed early check-in was not charged to your reservation; unfortunately, on some dates we are unable to accommodate early check-in, and do not process the charge under those circumstances.

2019-05-09 20:42:27] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good evening Ms. Hinker,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I'm delighted to see that you enjoyed most of your stay, but I do apologize about any miscommunication regarding the Midwest Starz rate. I was able to offer the second night at a discounted rate as a one time courtesy, but unfortunately if the block rate was not available for booking, we are generally unable to provide the block rate for outside reservations. We do pride ourselves on our customer service abilities, and if you have any concerns regarding booking a block rate in the future, we do have an in-house reservations manager who is happy to work with guests prior to arrival to get them the best available rate. For any confusion regarding the amount charged to your card, I have re-sent a copy of your guest folio via email. Any overage beyond what is indicated on the folio may be an incidental hold, which we release at check-out. Unfortunately, some financial institutions may take a few business days to reflect that release. Please rest assured that the amount on the receipt is the amount that was the final charge. We do hope to see you again soon, so that we may have another opportunity to provide an excellent experience.

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any assistance, please feel free to contact me directly.

Best wishes,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize that the rate was not adjusted; unfortunately, when the breakfast is built into the rate, we are unable to change this despite a guest not eating breakfast with us. For any future stays, we do have various packages or a la carte breakfast that may be purchased day-by-day to alleviate any issues if you may not be able to dine with us on any morning you are here. However, I do hope that you enjoyed the rest of your stay, and we do hope to see you again soon!

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any assistance, please don't hesitate to contact me directly.

We are utilizing this experience as a coaching opportunity for all colleagues, and continue to strive to meet the high standards that we have set for ourselves. I again apologize for what you and your family experienced, and appreciate you bringing this to our attention.

I was wondering if you had any additional details about your stay that you could provide me with, so that we may utilize this opportunity to coach our colleagues.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I'm delighted to see that you enjoyed most of your stay, but it appears we may have missed the mark with the food & beverage experience. I apologize for the issues you experienced with any wait staff, we certainly continue to coach all colleagues to improve the guest experience. We do hope to see you again soon!

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any assistance, please feel free to contact me directly.

Best wishes,

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our survey and provide us with feedback about your stay. I see you had an experience with continental breakfast that did not live up to your expectations. While we always try to provide fresh and good tasting food we seem to have missed the mark with your meal. If you could provide and specifics as to what did not live up to your expectations, we can use this as teaching experience for my team to improve our performance if we have the opportunity to serve you again.  If you have any other concerns or comments please feel free to contact me at the email below.
Thank you.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for any miscommunication that may have occurred; there is a $25 incidental hold at check-in that is released upon check-out. Some financial institutions may take a few business days to reflect the release of funds, but please rest assured that on our end there was no extra charge. The final bill for your guest room was $109.73, which was solely room and tax. Incidental holds are standard at all hotels, but I again apologize if this was not better explained to you at check-in or check-out. We do hope to see you again soon!

If you have any further concerns, please feel free to contact me directly.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I'm delighted to see that you enjoyed most of your stay, however, it looks like there was room for improvement in both the cleanliness of the room and our customer service. I was wondering if you had any additional details about your stay that you could provide me with, so that we may utilize this opportunity to coach our colleagues. 

I look forward to hearing from you!

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the negative experience you had in our Pub333 on Saturday. Please know that your comments have been addressed, and though it was not the intention of our Outlets manager to come off as rude, we acknowledge that intentions may not always come across the right way. We do always want our guests to feel welcome, and will utilize this situation as a coaching opportunity for all colleagues, so that we may grow and learn from our mistakes. However, I do hope you enjoyed the rest of your stay, and we hope to see you again soon!

2019-04-30 08:03:54] Email received from: Brian Zenefski <brewwolfone@mail.com>: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you Emma for your reply. It is much appreciated in a world today where more and more things seem to just get blown off. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Concerning the 333 Pub their poor quality many times, their high prices and slow service seems to be an on going issue. I have always believed a higher class place such as the Hyatt could do much better than having the&nbsp;333 Pub as far as an eating choice. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where as I am on&nbsp;the board of the Packer Chapter which recently had our annual Trade A Thon show at the Hyatt and KI Convention Center, we do periodically hold a board meeting in the 333 Pub. Most times I will not order anymore and when I did this last time I ended up throwing the chili I had out because it was to spicy for me. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the case of the 333 Pub I will admit that once I finally did get my food this past Friday the pan fried walleye I got was very good. Although it did come with a few potato's I do wish a person could get a baked or mashed potato because a lot of people are not fond of&nbsp;french fries or sweet potato fries. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If there is anything I can do to further explain anything to you please contact me either by email or at 920-720-9380. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As far as the hotel itself I have always been very satisfied. The rooms are large, clean and over all the condition of everything is kept up very well. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anything that required a little extra as far as what arose&nbsp;as a far as my being a board member was dealt with promptly and to my immediate satisfaction. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Have a great day.&nbsp; Brian Zenefski &nbsp;  Sent:&nbsp;Monday, April 29, 2019 at 9:58 PM

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I'm delighted to see that you enjoyed most of your stay, but it appears that there were some items that were not working in your guest room. I was wondering if you had any additional feedback that you would be able to provide me with, so that we may utilize this experience as a coaching opportunity for our staff members, to learn from our mistakes. 

I look forward to hearing from you!

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I'm delighted to see that you enjoyed most of your stay, but it appears that there were some items that were not working in your guest room. I was wondering if you had any additional feedback that you would be able to provide me with, so that we may utilize this experience as a coaching opportunity for our staff members, to learn from our mistakes. 

I look forward to hearing from you!

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the lack of cleanliness in your guest room. This certainly does not meet our standards, and your comments have been shared with our Housekeeping Management team so that we may use this as a coaching opportunity for our colleagues and learn from our mistakes. We do hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back as our guest, so that we may have a second chance to provide an excellent experience.

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any assistance, please don't hesitate to contact me directly.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. We certainly appreciate your loyalty, and I am delighted to share with you that as a World of Hyatt Member, you do receive these benefits. I see that your most recent stays have been booked under the My Hyatt Rate - with that rate, you do save 10% on each nightly standard rate while staying with us. You have also been earning points for each stay with us; you can access your balance through world.hyatt.com, or by calling 800.544.9288. A free night at our property is 8,000 points, but this will vary from property to property. If you do have any other questions regarding your membership, please feel free to contact me directly. We look forward to seeing you again soon!

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our survey and provide us with feedback about your stay. I see you were disappointed in our lack of a happy hour during your stay. Unfortunately the timing of your stay was just a couple of days off of our implementation of our new happy hour menu that is actually starting today, 4/26, as well as a full new menu starting in the pub on the first of May. I hope we will have the opportunity serve you again and our reworking of the pub and happy hour menu will fit your needs.  If you have any other concerns or comments please feel free to contact me at the email below.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable loyalty as a Discoverist. I noticed that we may have missed the mark a few times during your stay, and I was wondering if you had any additional details you could provide me with about your experience with us. We strive to learn from our mistakes and continuously improve ourselves and our facilities for our guests, and any feedback you may have is extremely valuable. 

I look forward to hearing from you!

2019-05-01 13:13:55] Email received from: K H <holehouse@hotmail.com>: I was the first guest to visit the Sunday buffet at about 7:30 am.  The toaster was set to 'burnt' and some of the bread for the toaster seemed stale.  I was served some strange tasting coffee and when I inquired was told the kitchen was out of regular coffee.  The eggs and potatoes on the self-serve buffet were barely warm.
The thermostat in my room could not be moved from 68 degrees and the blower, which could not be turned off despite my all efforts, constantly blew cold air.  I note from a review on Trip Advisor  that I am not the only guest who suffered with this problem.

2019-04-29 10:31:51] Email received from: BA Faller <beckyandyfaller@gmail.com>: Thanks, Adam. My apologies - I honestly don’t know what score I submitted regarding the food. We had a rehearsal dinner on Friday and a brunch on Sunday as part of the wedding we were attending. The food was good - I recall my family and I particularly enjoying the warm pastries and crisp bacon on Sunday. Friday meal was also good tasting as I recall. The staff were incredibly helpful and even assisted us with our little ones plates.
Please feel free to share this email with your leadership and other management - I apologize if I recorded lower scores, as I really don’t think that was our intent.
Thank you,
Becky

I had to ask twice to have my room cleaned the second night I was there; they finally got to it late Tuesday night. I had brunch one morning and the service and food were terrible. I felt $180 a night for the room I had was to high in Green Bay, Wisconsin.  Parking was overcrowded, you all charged me $7 a night for parking and twice I couldn't even find a space in the lot.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I'm delighted to see that you enjoyed most of your stay, but it appears we may have missed the mark in terms of food & beverage. I was wondering if you had any additional details you could provide me with, so that we may learn from our mistakes and improve the guest experience.

I look forward to hearing from you!

Best wishes,

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our survey and provide us with feedback about your stay. I see you had an experience with your breakfast that did not live up to your expectations. While we always try to provide hot, fresh, good tasting food we seem to have missed the mark with your meal.

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. We appreciate your guest feedback and for choosing Hyatt Regency Green Bay from your recent stay. I apologize about the guest room type you experienced and if it was less than satisfactory. We have added a profile note so that we do not place any future reservations in 501 again, or in a similar open space concept. I am pleased overall that you had a positive impression with our facilities. We hope you give us another chance to welcome you back to Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

Subject: Your recent stay at Hyatt Regency Green Bay
Greetings Ms. Clark,
Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. We appreciate your guest feedback and for choosing Hyatt Regency Green Bay from your recent stay. I apologize about the guest room type you experienced and if it was less than satisfactory. We have added a profile note so that we do not place any future reservations in 501 again, or in a similar open space concept. I am pleased overall that you had a positive impression with our facilities. We hope you give us another chance to welcome you back to Hyatt Regency Green Bay.
Sincerely,

Thank you for reaching out to me. I received an email prior from the Hyatt regarding early check-in. I purchased early check-in at noon, and the room was not ready when I got there. My conference started at 1:00pm, so I wanted to be checked in and settled before the conference started. I was a little disappointed that the early check-in was offered, and my room was not ready when I arrived at noon.
I hope you have a great evening!

2019-04-15 17:41:11] Email received from: Hopper Timothy <Timothy.Hopper@sentry.com>: Hello,
Overall we had a very nice stay and I have no complaints. I didn’t rate the check-in process as high as it could have been because I had to initiate the conversation (as opposed to being greeted with something like “good evening, are you checking in?) and then I had to ask about the parking (instead of “are you parking a vehicle with us?”) and then after getting my keys I had to ask where the elevator was (something like “the elevators are to your right in the atrium and you will want to take the set on the left...” would have been a nice touch.
Obviously there was nothing that was so bad that it impacted my stay or that would prevent me from returning but since you asked I am sharing my feedback.

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. We appreciate your World of Hyatt loyalty and guest feedback. I sincerely apologize about the issues you experienced during your stay, especially the atrium noise that occurred during breakfast time. I am sorry if this impacted your overall stay as we try to provide a tranquil guest room experience. I am pleased that you had a seamless check-in process and positive staff interaction. Please know that your feedback has been addressed with our team so that it can be improved for future stays. I have added a quiet room preference on your World of Hyatt notes so that we can assign you a room away from noise such as elevators, and ice-machines for future stays with us. We hope you give us another chance to welcome you back to Hyatt Regency Green Bay to provide an excellent stay for you. Please let me know if you have any other additional questions or concerns.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I do apologize for the inconvenience of not being able to bring outside food into the Pub. We do enforce this to follow health code and promote our own dining options, as other restaurants similarly do. When our Pub kitchen closes, we do have other dining options in our Market that can be eaten in our Pub area. However, I do hope that you enjoyed the rest of your stay. We hope to see you again soon, so that we may have another opportunity to provide an excellent experience for you.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the issues you experienced while at our hotel. This is certainly not the impression we want to leave our guests with, and we will utilize all of these situations as coaching opportunities for our colleagues in the future. I do see our Front Office Manager, Kristin, was able to adjust off some room charges for you for the noise that disturbed you; I'm glad she was able to assist. I have also gone ahead and refunded your parking charges on both reservations for the issues with the parking gates. I do recognize you as a frequent guest, and as always we appreciate your loyalty and patronage. We do hope to have another opportunity to have you as our guest, so that we may provide an excellent experience for you.

The service was so poor in the restaurants I would recommend going elsewhere for food, including breakfast.  There is a safety concern in that it is difficult to navigate the stairwells due to poor signage in order to get to first floor or out of the property. The elevators are so slow you are sure to want to navigate the stairwells.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the mishap regarding parking; I have adjusted off the $7 charge, you should see this amount refunded on your card within a few business days. I will also be utilizing this mistake as a coaching opportunity for our colleagues. We certainly do not want to charge a parking fee to guests who are not parked in our lot, so I again apologize for the mistake on our part. However, I'm delighted to see that you enjoyed the rest of your stay, and we hope to see you again soon!

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me directly.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the issues you experienced during your stay. I will certainly utilize these situations as coaching opportunities for our staff members; we are consistently looking to learn from our mistakes and improve the guest experience and service. Our Front Office Host and Manager expressed a great deal of concern for your issues at check-out, and I do understand that breakfast does not fix these issues, but we do like to offer some sort of recompense for inconveniences experienced in our hotel. Unfortunately, at check-out we were unable to rectify the hot water situation for you due to the departure. I do apologize again for this. We do hope to have another opportunity to provide you with an excellent experience.

Good morning Ms Reindl,
Thank you for taking the time to fill out our survey and provide us with feedback about your stay. I see you had an experience with your stay that did not live up to your expectations. While we always try to provide hot, fresh, good tasting food we seem to have missed the mark with your meal. We will use this as teaching experience for my team to improve our performance if we have the opportunity to serve you again.  If you have any other concerns or comments please feel free to contact me at the email below.
Thank you.

The stay was not bad overall - the heat was the real issue.  I could hear people taking at the conference that their rooms were so warm.  I couldn't get my heat up past 66.  And the meeting rooms in the Convention Center were extremely cold.  One Thursday I went to my room to get a coat.  Maybe it was just me.....

Overall the stay was great just a few small concerns that may or may not be
the hotels fault. One is that the hotel was really busy that weekend and
the pool and hot tub was overly crowded and loud. Hot tub was luke warm.
Another small issue was our bathtub was draining extremely slow. Water
backed up as you showered.
Thanks for your time.

2019-04-08 12:30:34] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good afternoon Mr. Bailey,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize if I made myself unavailable and presented myself in such a fashion. I certainly strive to provide better service than that, and that impression was not my intention. I will certainly be more mindful of any miscommunication of intent between myself and guests for future interactions, and I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. In regards to our HVAC system, during seasonal changes we toggle between heating and cooling based on guest demands. Unfortunately during the first two nights of your stay, we had the heat on due to a cold wave in a majority of guest rooms. In this case we offer a fan or suggest cracking the patio doors in the guest rooms to provide some air circulation; I apologize again that I did not mention this during our conversation. We do hope to see you again soon so that we may have another chance to provide an excellent experience for you.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me directly.

Best wishes,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize about the issue you experienced with the breakfast buffet. I'm delighted that I was able to adjust off the $22 charge for you. I have also shared your feedback with our Culinary leadership; the reduced buffet/a la carte system was something that we wanted to test with our guests, but we certainly don't want it to impact any stays negatively. I will keep a lookout for your reservations and do my best to ensure that the full buffet is available on the mornings that you are with us. We appreciate your loyalty as a Discoverist, and hope to see you again soon.

If you have any further concerns, or if I can be of any further assistance, please feel free to contact me directly.

Best wishes,

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. I sincerely apologize for the issues you experienced, especially the parking setback you had. Our overnight parking fee of $7 is reduced for hotel guests, and as we are located downtown Green Bay, want to provide the best available parking access for you. As a one time courtesy, I refunded the $14 parking charge to your card on file for the 2 nights you stayed with us. Please give it a few business days to reflect on your card. The Main Street Parking ramp would be the next available option for overflow parking in an event you aren't able to find one. I apologize if this impacted your overall stay, we try to provide a positive experience for all our guests. Please know that your feedback is shared with our team as we move forward and improve our facilities. We hope you give us another chance to welcome you back to Hyatt Regency Green Bay, please let me know if there's anything else I can do for you!

Again, he said he would send someone up.  Still, after probably another hour, no one came.  I finally called down to desk again and asked for another room.  We were finally moved to a new room (after my suggestion) and it seemed like everything was going to be ok...until the max temp of that new room was only 69 degrees.  At least the fan was fairly quiet in the new room, so we knew it shouldn’t keep us awake all night.  We were so tired at that point, that we just went to bed so we could at least be under the blankets for more warmth.  The woman at the desk the next morning, when we checked out, was very apologetic about the situation.",,,,,,Yes,Closed,"2019-04-02 18:59:33] Alert Created: Likelihood to Recommend: Likelihood to Recommend;

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I wanted to follow up on your survey as well as when I had reached out to you via email. I again apologize for all of these issues, they are certainly not

I'm glad Danielle was able to take care of your at check-out, she was very concerned about the situation as the rest of us were. We do hope to see you again soon, so that we may have another chance to provide an excellent experience for you.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I apologize if I came across as rude; I was happy to extend a $20 credit to your room for the issues you had experienced. Unfortunately, on the nights you stayed with us, the room type that you had booked was the only room type that was available for your reservation. I was unable to move you into a different room type, as I would have gladly done if we were not at full occupancy. I certainly did note on your profile that you prefer room types with a separate living room/bedroom, and prefer to be placed away from others. I did inspect the bathroom in the room you had occupied and discovered everything to be intact; with guest bathrooms right next to each other, we are regrettably not able to prevent some noise transference. We do hope to see you again soon so that we may have another opportunity to provide an excellent experience. 

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me.

When you can hear someone full conversation and your telling me there is nothing you can do!!!! I get it you probably can’t control all the noise but I can’t believe I could stand in the bathroom and hear everything!!! Well I will be bringing the video to a lawyer seeing there is nothing you can do cause I believe that’s invasion of privacy!!!

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. We appreciate the suggestions given, and I will certainly pass these along to our leadership team for consideration. I did also want to note that the breakfast package offered at the desk saves a total of $17, including breakfast for 2, the parking fee of $7, a $5 food and beverage credit, and a premium WiFi upgrade. I apologize if that package was not better explained at check-in. We do have always-available rates that do include breakfast on our website as well - these are available for booking online or over the phone. Again, thank you for your feedback, and we do hope to see you again, so that we may have another opportunity to provide an excellent experience.

communicated to us.  Perhaps some sort of small card or printed on the back
of the key card would be a nice way to not only inform your guests, but
serves as a reminder, and can be used as verification for guests to use

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the disappointment this policy has caused; due to the nature of our business and the food options available within our hotel, it is standard policy for any outside food and beverages to be consumed solely in guest rooms. This safeguards against any licensing issues if there were any incidents on property with external food and beverage, as the laws regarding food and beverage sold on-property and off-property are different. We certainly do appreciate you bringing the cleanliness of the tables to our attention so that we could rectify that situation. If you do find yourself in the area again, we hope to have the second chance to provide an excellent experience.

I certainly empathize with what you are saying, and we do strive to provide stellar service. However, please also understand that we do sell food and beverage, including pizza, in our hotel. When guests consume outside food and beverage in public areas, this can interfere with the perception of another part of our business. We are more than happy to provide private space, if available, for our guests to consume their food upon request if they do not wish to utilize their guest rooms.
Thank you for your understanding.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey. We certainly appreciate your feedback regarding the pet fee, and will pass this along to our leadership for consideration. Currently the fee is in place not only to safeguard against any accidents, but for deep cleaning to remove any allergens for guests sensitive to animal dander.

I would appreciate anything you can do... possibly waiving the pet fee the next time I stay there.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I apologize for the issues you experienced that had a negative impact on your stay. Please know the situation with the Room Attendant was addressed as soon as you made us aware at the desk, and we will continue to coach our staff members to learn from our mistakes. I also apologize that we were unable to reach you to get you into a different room; I had spoken with you on the morning of your second night, and prepared a room that was within the room type you had booked, but I was unable to reach you in your guest room to initiate the room move. We do hope to see you again sometime, so that we may have a second chance to provide an excellent experience.

Thank you for the follow-up. We could not figure out some of the lighting switches in our room (specifically the lamp closest to bed when you walk in), but we did not pick up the phone to have it checked.
We enjoyed our stay and thought the room was excellent!

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. We appreciate your World of Hyatt loyalty and guest feedback. I apologize about the guest room condition and if this impacted your overall stay. Our guest rooms have newly installed Cubie Blues that have additional outlets for items to plug, I am sorry if this was not communicated to you.

You can certainly call front desk for any issues in the guest room as we want to make sure you have a comfortable stay.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize about the issues you experienced during your stay with us. We certainly never want our guests to feel as if they are an inconvenience; guest satisfaction and comfort is our number one priority, and I will be using this as a coaching opportunity for our colleagues. Please also know that we do have temporary parking available outside of our hotel main entrance for any luggage drop off, so that you do not have to bring anything across the skywalk. I again apologize that this was not effectively communicated to you when overflow parking was necessary. I'm glad that the second room you were placed in was comfortable, and hope that the rest of your stay with us was pleasant. We do hope to see you again soon, so that we may have another chance to provide an excellent experience for you.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me directly.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the issues you experienced while you were with us. Guest satisfaction and comfort is our number one priority, and it is regrettable that we were not able to rectify the issues you had during your stay. Due to the age of our building, unfortunately the heating system isn't quite as advanced as other hotels in the area. I'm glad we were able to provide you with a space heater, but I do apologize if it wasn't able to appropriately dispense heat throughout your guest room. We do always have extra blankets available for our guests as another means to provide warmth. I will also be passing along your feedback regarding your food & beverage experience to our Executive Chef; we are in the process of implementing a completely new menu, which we are excited to present. I understand your disappointment, but do hope we get to see you again for a second chance to provide an excellent experience.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I do see we scored fairly low in the Food & Beverage category, and was wondering if you have any additional details you may be able to provide regarding your experience. We strive to learn from our mistakes to improve the guest experience, so any feedback you may have is much appreciated. I do hope you enjoyed the rest of your stay; if you find yourself in the Green Bay area, we would love the opportunity to have you as our guest again.

I look forward to hearing from you!

2019-03-24 14:57:33] Email received from: marie richards <marie.beth.richards@gmail.com>: Hello,
It was the room service breakfast I received the first morning of my stay.
I didn't realize the problem until the person who delivered it left and I
didn't have time to call down. I received dry toast with no butter or
jelly/jam and I did not receive a glass of ice water--which I didn't order
but generally comes standard with room service. I didn't get any salt,
pepper, or ketchup. And I didn't receive a cup for my coffee which wasn't
much of a problem since there were cups in my room. The food was good, I
was just missing a few things.

Nothing major, just minor annoyances. The iron leaked water, and got the ironing board wet. The replacement worked great. The ironing board was rather short but serviceable. The toilet seemed short but I have a higher one at home so it might just be me. The heating system was loud and never seemed to turn off. Finally, checking in and out seemed to take awhile- they were very polite and apologized for the wait. 
Like I said, nothing major but the combination of it just didn’t enhance my stay. 
Thanks for asking, I wish you and your staff the best of success.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the items you were missing in your guest room, and for the lack of response from our Front Desk staff. This is certainly below our standards, and we will be using your feedback as coaching opportunities for our staff members to improve our service levels. We do have varying TV sizes in each guest room type; some TV sizes are upgraded due to the room type being upgraded. I am happy to place a note on your profile that you would prefer a room with a larger TV when available. We do hope to see you again soon, so that we may have another opportunity to provide an excellent experience for you.

If you have any further concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to contact me. 

Best wishes,

Thank you for the follow up, I did enjoy my stay and the hotel was great.
I did have a question for you.  I was in town staying on the Breakthrough
rate and paid with my personal credit card.  I spoke with Breakthrough and
they said that they would switch the charge over to their card and I would
be refunded.  She told me she had spoken to you all at the hotel but I
haven't seen the refund on my credit card yet.  Can you confirm that the
charges were switched over to their account?
Thank You,
Spencer

2019-03-21 08:08:00] Reply Sent: Hello Mr. Bullock,
I can certainly confirm that the charges were switched over; it appears the refund posted on March 19th. It may take a couple of days for that to reflect on any financial statements. I know depending on the financial institution it can take anywhere from 2-4 business days after we post the refund. But please rest assured that this was taken care of, you will be receiving a refund of $108.57.
If there is anything further I can assist with, please let me know!

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I wanted to reach out to you regarding the water in your guest room. I wanted to share that we had recently undergone a water shutoff, which causes the first bit of water to each guest room to come out discolored. I apologize that this was not communicated to you; we strive to learn from our mistakes, and have a new procedure in place to prevent our guests from dealing with the initial discoloration. We do hope to see you again soon, so that we may have a second chance to provide an excellent experience!

I try not to give negative reviews, but stay in a fair amount of hotels.  The check-in delay was a problem and in my mind not dealt with in a timely manner. In the end, there was some dispensation, but I felt the organizations response to the checkin issue warranted more attention.  The hotel facilities are nicely appointed.

To begin with, there was no window in the room. Does this conform with fire code? There was hair in the bathroom and a piece of food (small but a piece) on the counter in the bathroom. 
The elevators were insufferably slow.
One amenity that would please guests in a small way is access to free coffee and tea. There is a coffee bar, true, but there is a charge for the coffee/tea.
None of these things alone make or break the stay, but all together, they make the stay substandard.
Best regards

So to have a room that could not have the temperature changed was not well. The loudness of the room heater was loud and disrupted sleep most every time is cycled and eventually the first night I slept on the sofa. On the second night, when I arrived in the room, the heater unit would not shut down, running constantly. Contacted the front desk for assistance, and the only thing offered would be to completely shut it off. That night I simply closed to the bedroom area and slept again on the sofa. Finally in the morning the unit shut off. But the room was no where to be considered 'warm'.

So to have a room that could not have the temperature changed was not well. The loudness of the room heater was loud and disrupted sleep most every time is cycled and eventually the first night I slept on the sofa. On the second night, when I arrived in the room, the heater unit would not shut down, running constantly. Contacted the front desk for assistance, and the only thing offered would be to completely shut it off. That night I simply closed to the bedroom area and slept again on the sofa. Finally in the morning the unit shut off. But the room was no where to be considered 'warm'.

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I apologize for the issue you experienced regarding the service charge during breakfast. I do know that the charge is standard practice for groups over 8 people, but we certainly understand that there are circumstances that may require some accommodation. I am happy to see that this was resolved for you at the desk; please know we will review this experience as a coaching opportunity for our colleagues, so that we may learn from our mistakes and improve our service. However, I'm delighted to see that you enjoyed the rest of your stay, and we do hope to see you again!

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize about the multiple factors that added up to a disappointing stay. We certainly strive for better service than what you had experienced, and I can completely understand your disappointment. Please know that the wait is not typical for our hotel; we had a full turn from one night to the next, and though we strive to keep that from affecting our guests, unfortunately it had an impact we did not foresee. In reference to the number of guests, during the time of your booking we had a decent amount of vacancies, but we did see an influx of family reservations in the days leading up to your arrival date.  I again apologize for the negative influence this had on your stay. If you do find yourself in the area again, please feel free to contact me directly using the information below, and I am happy to use the resources available to me to provide a suggestion for a lower occupancy weekend. We do appreciate your company's support in the giving of gift certificates for our property, and certainly hope for that relationship to continue. 

If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I apologize for the wait you experienced, as well as the lack of hand rails in your guest room bathroom. It does appear that you were placed into the room type you had booked; however, I have made a note on your reservation that for any future reservations at any Hyatt hotel you would prefer a room with hand rails. Unfortunately, we do have only three guest rooms in our hotel that have this feature, and on the night you were staying with us, they were already occupied. But we will certainly make an effort for any future reservations to ensure you are placed in a room that is most comfortable for you. We do hope to see you again soon, so that we may have another opportunity to provide an excellent experience!

2019-03-12 14:22:46] Email received from: Jeffery Kennedy <effy17@gmail.com>: The shower/tub was draining slowly. I did tell them at the desk. I don’t
think they were aware of this prior to me telling them. I really like
staying at this hotel when I stay in Green Bay (I stay in it 9 out of 10
times I stay in Green Bay)! The staff there is wonderful as well! Keep up
the great work!

There really was nothing you would have been able to do to make our stay
better. We were attending a wedding and did not get back till late. We did
not want to have to stay up and wait for someone to fix the HVAC. We only
stayed there one night so the discounted parking of $5 really doesn't help
me. The least you could do is refund either part or all of the room fee. We
will not be coming back to stay with you.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I do apologize for the issues you experienced with our hot tub and steam room. Please know that we have identified the issue with the steam room, and the malfunctioning parts have been replaced. We also do our best to adjust the temperature within the hot tub as it is brought to our attention, but we frequently find that guests switching between the pool/hot tub and hitting the emergency stop button are common issues that cause the temperature to drop. We will certainly use your feedback as coaching opportunities for our Engineering staff, and hope to see you again soon, so that we may have another opportunity to provide an excellent experience!

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me directly. 

Best wishes,

Emma Lee

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize for the issues you experienced during your stay with us, as we certainly hold ourselves to a higher standard that what was presented to you. Please know that your feedback will be used as a coaching opportunity in all departments, so that we may more efficiently service our guests. Our Housekeeping department does generally handle Lost & Found items, which may have lead to the transfer, but I understand that in urgent situations this may not always be the best option for our guests. I appreciate you bringing this situation to our attention so that we can learn and grow from our mistakes. We do hope to see you again soon, so that we may have a second chance to provide you with an excellent experience. If you do find yourself in the area, please feel free to reach out to me personally, and I am happy to personally ensure a Hyatt-worthy stay. 

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me directly.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I do see that there were a couple areas of improvement for our property as indicated by your survey. I was wondering if you had any additional details you could provide about the working order of your guest room and the food and beverage experiences you had with us. I would love the opportunity to learn and grow from these mistakes with our colleagues, as well as to rectify any situation for you. I look forward to hearing from you!

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our survey and provide us with feedback about your stay. While I’m glad to see you enjoyed the majority of your stay, I noticed you rated your overall food and beverage considerably lower than the rest of your ratings, and was wondering if there was anything specific that you felt was not up to your expectations that you would like to share. We will use any information you provide as a learning experience, and hope to be able surpass your expectations if we have the opportunity to serve you again. If you have any concerns or comments please feel free to contact me at the email below

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey. I see that in each area of your stay, we were scored with a 0. I was wondering if you had any comments you could provide me with regarding your stay, so that we may use this opportunity as a coaching experience, and to rectify the situation for you. I look forward to hearing from you!

I was looking into your reservation and noticed it was booked by our Central Reservations team, not by a manager on our property. I do apologize that they misinformed you of how many rooms were available, but it does appear you did get the best available nightly rate for the night you stayed. I just want to ensure I understand the issue you faced so that we can resolve it. If you have any further comments about your interactions or what displeased you about our property, that would be greatly helpful.
Thank you,

Due to high call volumes at our Central Reservations center, the initial service is automated, but we do have customer service staff available 24/7; the automated service will quickly direct guests to a live person upon request. We pride ourselves on customer service at Hyatt, but unfortunately with so many calls going into our call centers, the customer service representatives aren’t always immediately available for each guest. As far as the property level, we have an automated service solely to get you to the correct person or department; the rest is handled all with a live person.
However, we appreciate your thoughts and feedback.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback.

In addition, please know that we do have an Engineer on staff during most hours of the day, and we are certainly happy to dispatch them when they are available to assist with anything that may be malfunctioning. I sincerely apologize that your heating issue was not appropriately dealt with, and we will use this as a coaching opportunity with our staff members for any future instances.

The salads were fine and served well the food was put on our table but we did not have any plates. When the plates were brought out about 10 minutes later they were put on the table in a pile. I had to get up and give everyone a plate.
Saturday nights meal went much better thanks for asking.

Thank you for choosing to say with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay.  I am happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us.  I would like to thank you for letting us know about the mini fridge not working properly; our staff was able to address the issue before having it affect future guests.  I hope you had fun in celebrating the wedding and look forward to having you with us again should you find yourself in Green Bay.

Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay and for choosing Hyatt Regency Green Bay.  I am sorry that your room was too warm during your stay.  Unfortunately during the winter, air conditioning is unavailable and the quickest way to cool a room down is by turning the heating off with the assistance of a fan.   The parking gates were up due to the weather.  Two gate arms were actually broken by the wind on Sunday.  I understand your concern for all of our guests to be able to park in the front lot.  Fortunately, there is garage parking available that connects to the hotel via sky walk.  I'm glad you enjoyed the breakfast and hope everyone had fun at the tournament.  Thank you again for staying with us and feel free contact me should you need anything.

I am glad to hear that you enjoyed the pool and breakfast during your stay.  I am sorry to hear that there were issues with cleanliness and your first room was too noisy.  I have followed up with housekeeping and noted the circumstances on  your reservation.  I hope you enjoyed the coffee and service from Danielle, as she was very concerned about the mishap to the start of your stay.  I ask that you give our service another chance when you return to Green Bay, as we've made note of room location preference and extra attention to detail.  Please feel free to contact me directly for any future assistance to ensure we prepare your room accordingly.  Thank you for choosing to stay with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and stay warm as we all expect more snow.

2019-03-01 02:51:28] Email received from: M H <gotdogs3@live.com>: The only reason I rated it as such was because it was a bit noisy into the evening.  This of course was beyond your control.  There was some sort of function in town which involved a lot of children which is why it was noisy.  I enjoyed my stay and will be back.
Thanks

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I do sincerely apologize for the noise disruption you experienced during both of your stays. We do have Security staff on during all hours to prevent too much disruption on full occupancy nights like the one you experienced. Please know that we are continuing to try new things to improve the tranquility of our hotel. Unfortunately, due to the original construction with the atrium setup, the sound travels much more than we would like it to. I also apologize for the confusion regarding your breakfast package. The information given by the Front Desk is correct - we did have a few groups in house that needed breakfast tickets with special instructions, which appears to have led to the miscommunication with the breakfast servers. I appreciate your feedback and we will use this as a coaching opportunity for all of our staff members. We do hope to see you again so that we may have another opportunity to provide you with an excellent experience. If you do book a future stay, please contact me directly so that I can personally take care of your reservation.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest survey, and for your valuable feedback. I do again apologize for the issues you experienced with your guest room, from the initial wrong room to the key issues and heating. Unfortunately, in the wintertime there is no air conditioning available, so despite our best efforts, our only options after turning the heat off for a guest room is to prop open the patio door and offer a fan. However, I am happy to see that you enjoyed the rest of your stay. We do hope to see you again sometime so that we may have another opportunity to provide an excellent experience.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I do apologize for any issues regarding the signage outside of our hotel - we are connected to the KI Convention Center, but only the hotel itself is Hyatt-owned. I do also appreciate your feedback regarding our food and beverage pricing, I will pass this along to our Outlets team and Executive Chef so that they make consider making changes. We are always looking for ways to grow and improve. There are a plethora of other dining options across the street from our hotel on Washington Street; our Front Desk staff is always more than happy to assist with any restaurant recommendations and reservations. We do hope to see you again sometime so that we may have a second opportunity to provide an excellent experience.

Good morning Mr. Eggers,
Thank you for taking the time to fill out our survey and provide us with feedback about your stay. I see you had an experience from our room service that did not live up to your expectations. While we strive to always make fresh food as efficiently as possible, it seems we missed the mark on your room service order.  While business in the restaurant can sometimes delay room service orders, I agree that your wait for your room service order is a concern. I will use your feedback to help me coach my team to improve our performance if we have the opportunity to serve you again.  If you have any other concerns or comments please feel free to contact me at the email below.
Thank you. 

Sincerely,

Adam Zelten

Thank you for being our guest and providing feedback regarding your stay.  I am so sorry to hear that you were disturbed by the group staying in the hotel.  At the 2am bar close, it did get quite noisy until we got everyone upstairs and situated.  I apologize that we could not quiet things faster so you could get some sleep.  I see that you were not charged anything Sunday or Monday night.    We hope that on your next visit you will consider us again for a stay.

Warm regards,
Kristine

Good afternoon Ms. Lane

Thank you for being our guest and providing feedback regarding the lunch served in the convention center.  This year we tried a new option for lunch for the Arborists and unfortunately it was not a big hit.  Our new chef is working with the group to provide alternative  options and look forward to your visit next year.   No matter the option we should incorporate veggies and healthy alternatives.  

We love having the Arborists here in Green Bay and look forward to 2020.

Warm regards,
Kristine

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I do apologize for the issues you experienced with the water temperature and the floors in your guest room, I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. I also noticed we scored fairly low on Food & Beverage, and I wanted to inquire about any additional feedback you may have, so that we may use this opportunity as a coaching experience.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I do sincerely apologize for the cleanliness of your guest room upon arrival; that experience certainly isn't up to our standards, and your feedback will be conveyed to our Housekeeping team. It does appear that the room that was booked upon reservation was our ADA Double Queen suite, which was the room you were placed into. I have made a note on your guest profile that ADA room types are not within your preferences, so we can avoid placing you in those rooms if possible. Unfortunately during the dates of your stay we were at full occupancy and were unable to accommodate a room type change. However, I do hope that the rest of your stay with us was a delightful one, and I am glad to see that you enjoyed breakfast, I will share your comments with our Outlets manager. We hope to see you again soon, so that we may have another chance to provide an excellent experience for you!

If there is anything else I can assist with, please feel free to contact me directly.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I do apologize for the issues you experienced in your guest room, and appreciate you bringing them to our attention. I will certainly have our Engineering team take a look at the guest room to rectify these issues. Regarding your concerns with parking and breakfast, I first and foremost am sorry that parking was not thoroughly explained at check-in. I will use this situation as a coaching opportunity for my team to ensure we are accurately providing information. I do see that the rate plan you had booked was one of our standard rates, which was not within the rooming block of the convention. The rooming block rate did include parking as well as breakfast tickets, as conference rates are contracted differently than our standard guest rates. This may have been where the disconnect occurred, as the rate you had booked did not include those contracted add-ons. Our standard rate does have parking with a fee of $7 per day and breakfast at a rate of $12.50 per adult. Again, I do apologize that this was not better communicated at check-in. However, I hope the rest of your stay was a delightful one, and we do hope to see you again soon!

If you do have any further questions or concerns, or need assistance with any reservations, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for clarifying for me.  I apologize for asking this, but is the reason I didn't get the conference rate because I booked the room that day.  The only reason that happened is because you didn't have any rooms at the time of booking, so I was forced to wait to see if there were rooms available.  I am just trying to understand for next time.  Thank you for your time.

We always have a certain number of rooms that are contracted by the block that are reserved solely for that group; however, once the group is sold out, any additional rooms must be reserved with the standard rate as you had done. Unfortunately the block had filled up quickly this time around, leading to a sold out hotel. There are also usually block cut-off dates, at which point any remaining rooms that were not reserved by a guest are released to the general public. If there are conventions coming up that you will be attending, please feel free to use me as your point of contact and I can certainly advise when the block is open so that we can ensure you are reserved into the rooming block.
Best wishes,

I apologize for any confusion and for the inconvenience of this issue. I was at the desk the evening that this mixup occurred, and the box of candy that was delivered was held in our secure storage for pickup. The guest who was meant to pick up the item had stopped by about an hour prior to the box being brought to us, and unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we were unable to get in touch with the guest in their room to advise them that the item had been dropped off. Please know that we take the storage and delivery of guest items very seriously. We do hope to see you again so that we may have the opportunity to provide an excellent experience for you.

I do apologize about that, and will discuss this issue with my staff members. There was an email sent out amongst the desk to ensure all hosts were aware of the box in the event anyone did come to pick it up, so I sincerely apologize that whichever staff member your husband spoke to did not retrieve the box out of storage. I will certainly be using this feedback as a coaching opportunity with my staff.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I do apologize for the issues you experienced during your stay, we will certainly use these situations as coaching opportunities. I did also want to share that there seemed to be a disconnect regarding the item that was dropped off. I was at the desk on the evening that this occurred, and I believe I was the one you spoke to about the item. We had not received the box that was dropped off at the time you had inquired, we received it approximately an hour later. I did attempt to reach you in your guest room, but with there being 3 occupied rooms with your name I was unable to reach you. I do apologize about the inconvenience with the situation, and please know that we do take the holding and delivery of guest items seriously. However, I do hope the rest of your stay was enjoyable, and we hope to see you again soon!

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me directly. 

Best wishes,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I do apologize for any miscommunication that may have occurred at the desk, but upon reviewing the reservation, it does appear the ADA King Suite that you were placed in was the room that was reserved. Generally we are certainly able to accommodate a room type change, but due to a full occupancy the night of your stay, we had no rooms with double queen beds available to move you into. I do hope we get the chance to see you again and provide an excellent stay.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me directly.

Everything about our stay at the Hyatt Regency was wonderful with the exception of the food.  My wife had a salad and I had a pulled pork sandwich (which had a big gob of fat on it).  The sweet potato fries were overcooked and crunchy.  My wife told me her salad was mostly iceberg lettuce.  We both felt the quality of the food was poor, especially considering the price.  I just thought you should know, which is why I mentioned it in the survey I took.  This would not deter me from staying at the Hyatt Regency again since everything else was excellent!  I hope this feedback is helpful

Thank you for being our guest and responding to the survey. I am happy to see you enjoyed your stay overall. 

I appreciate your comment about parking and I will look into having carts available in the crosswalk for guests needing assistance.   I also see you scored us low in food and beverage might you provide some feedback here as well?

I look forward to hearing back from you.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and for your valuable feedback. I am sincerely sorry to hear that the beds and pillows were not comfortable for you. Please know that we do have foam pillows available as an alternative if the down feather pillows are uncomfortable. We did also recently replace all mattresses in the hotel, we are always looking for ways to grow and improve. In addition, I have made a note on your guest profile for any Hyatt property to ensure you are placed in a guest room away from the street side, if at all possible. However, I do hope the rest of your stay was a delightful one, and we hope to see you again soon!

If there is anything further I can assist with, please feel free to contact me. 

Best wishes,

Good morning Ms. Dietz

Thank you for being our guest and providing feedback.  I appreciate the comments regarding Dawn, we will make sure she is recognized internally.  I see that you provided a negative score on Food and Beverage and was hoping you might share some comments?  It is through guest feedback that we make things better for your next stay.  We have just hired a new Executive Chef and I am sure feedback for him would be welcomed.

Warm regards,

Good afternoon Ms. Kairo,

Thank you for being our guest and taking the survey.  I am sorry to hear about your breakfast and pizza experience during your stay.   We have just recently hired a new Executive Chef and we were just discussing our pizza this week,  He is currently looking into other products.  We have also been trying some new things with breakfast and hope that as we continue to change we will find our best products.

We look forward to your next stay.

Warm regards,
Kristine

having a procedure done in Wisconsin. I have had a very pleasant stay every
time. That being said, this was my husband's first time with me on this
trip and the girl who checked us in was quite unwelcoming. It was if it
seems she was almost annoyed with us. When I asked questions her response
and tone made me feel like I was stupid for asking them. She treated the
situation as if I should have known everything front and back when in
reality it's her job not mine to know all the minor details. Other than
that everything was fine. The hotel was beautiful as always and we had a
great trip. Our room service was great. Thank you for checking in on the
matter.

Good afternoon Mr. Berken,

Thank you for being our guest and taking the survey.  It appears that you did not have a great stay.  Might I ask to elaborate on any service our working order issues you may have had.

I treat feedback as a gift and use it to coach the staff to create a better experience for our guests.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Warm regards,

2019-02-06 16:45:14] Email received from: Steve Berken <sshbc12707@gmail.com>: Hello!
Our stay was ok.  The level of service we are used to from Hyatt was less than expected. Although, it has been a few years so perhaps the brand is changing.
A few things I would touch upon:
The water jug in the pool area was empty. Keep it filled or remove it. 
Entry- greet people when they walk in the door. Why make a family wait for you behind and imaginary line while you type things on your computer before you can acknowledge or greet them?
There was no else there when we checked in, so make us feel welcome and not as if we are intruding upon your time.
The room was nice. I don’t understand the handwritten note stating “this is a cooler” 
Does that mean the fridge doesn’t work?
Overall it was ok. If something is okay, would that make us want to come back? Probably not.
Strive to be better than ok. Even the survey that was sent tells me you aren’t striving for near perfection. Nothing wowed me.
Thank you,
Steve and Kristine Berken

Thank you for providing us with feedback regarding your recent stay with us at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. It is through feedback like yours we are able to grow and evolve. I am glad to see that overall you enjoyed your recent stay. I  regret learning that our breakfast buffet was not set up on time the morning you mentioned. We have credited your World of Hyatt account with 1,000 World of Hyatt points in light of this. The points will appear in your World of Account within 1 to 3 business days from today. Please let us know if there is anything else we can assist you with.

Good morning Mr. Romanesko,

Thank you for being our guest and providing feedback.  I apologize you tub was not draining properly.  I will insure Engineering fixes it today.  It will also be great coaching for the Housekeeping staff to notice and report while cleaning,  

We appreciate your business and look forward to having you as a guest again in the future.

Warm regards,
Kristine

Thank you for being our guest and providing feedback.  I am glad to see you enjoy staying with us.  I am not sure what happened to the sauna, there was a temporary sign stating ""not to pour water into the sauna"" this morning when I arrived to work, but the unit was working.  My Director of Engineering is working with his team to see what happened.  I will also have him look into the loud fan in the room you stayed in.  

We appreciate your loyalty to Hyatt and you being a World of Hyatt member & look forward to your next visit.

Warm regards,
Kristine

Thank you for being our guest and providing feedback.    I am sorry to see that your room was cold.  Over the last few days we have struggled with temperatures and wind chills.  Please let us know anytime you are uncomfortable and we can assist by having Engineering check the thermostat or provide a small space heater to keep the room at your optimum temperature.  I will also have Engineering check the room. 

We appreciate your loyalty to Hyatt and look forward to your next stay.

Kristine

Thank you for being our guest and responding to the survey.  From our logs the pool was 84 degrees and air temps around 74,  Typically that is warm enough, but with the wind chills and the wall of windows our system may not have been able to keep up with the air temperature in the room.  I appreciate you letting me know as we got no other feedback regarding the pool this past weekend.  My Engineering team will look into how we might be able to get higher temperatures.

We hope that you visit us again soon.

Thank you for being our guest and taking the time to provide comments,   I apologize for the communication regarding our king bedded rooms,  All of the rooms are the same size; it is strictly a bedding choice between a king and 2-double queen beds,  Our king bedded rooms are an additional $10 per night,  Due to the confusion I am refunding you the $10 per night plus tax.  You will see a credit on you statement.  I am sorry for  the room deficiency comments as well and will use them as coaching for the staff.    We appreciate you being loyal to Hyatt and hope to have you back again in the future,  

Warm regards,

Thank you for being our guest and providing feedback regarding your stay.  Please accept my apologies for the lack of follow-up regarding the dirty chair in your room.

Thank you for responding.  My intention is to take care of you.  I always ask the question, so as not to provide credit to the wrong person.   I cannot tell from your stay who is paying for the room or if the card might be a company card.   In lieu of the credit might I send you a $50 Hyatt Gift Card that you can use personally?
Warm regards,
Kristine

Thank you for being our guest and responding to the survey.  It looks like overall you had a good stay but scored us low on Food & Beverage and Remembers Me and my Preferences.  Might you provide some feedback that we may use to improve our food and beverage options? I also have the ability to add profile notes to your World of Hyatt account so that we may better tailor your stay to your preferences.  if you would provide me some information.

We look forward to welcoming you back again soon.  Have a great rest of your week.

Warm regards,
Kristine

Thank you for being our guest and responding with feedback.  I values feedback as a gift and use it to make our service better.  I am sorry you room did not have a better view.  I see in your World of Hyatt profile notes you prefer a low floor and near the elevator.  We sometimes get complaints when we place guests on the south side of the building from street noise and I think we were trying to provide you with a tranquil night's sleep which unfortunately came with a bad view.  If this is something erroneous in your notes, I can certainly have it removed as we typically place our elite members on the 7th and 8th floors here in Green Bay.   I am sorry you found food and beverage average, but we have just hired a new Executive Chef and will be soon have  changes in all of our food and beverage outlets.

We look forward to welcoming your back in the future.

Warm regards,

Good afternoon Ms. Jenkins, 

Thank you for being our guest and taking the survey.  I appreciate your comments regarding the facility as we are always trying to keep things clean and up to date, while providing great service.   I am sorry we were missing some of your favorites on the buffet.  The numbers of items have not changed although the variety changes from time to time.  We have just added a new Chef to our staff and I am sure you will see changes during your next visit.

We look forward to welcoming you back again soon!

Warm regards,

The food & beverage part of survey was rated lower because it was a little
on the expensive side although it won't deter me from staying again.
Thank you for your email. A lot of hotels do not even consider sending
something out.

Thank you for being our guest and providing feedback.  Please let me apologize for the service you received at check-in.  I can assure you we will use this as coaching for the agent.   I appreciate all of your comments and please know I will take the time to check the room you stayed in to insure everything is clean and as it should be.  In regards to the elevators, they are slow and we try and manage them as best we can with insuring they are in optimal working order.  

I hope you have a great 2019!

We hope that if your travels bring you back to Green Bay that you will give Hyatt Regency Green Bay another try and see improvements.

Thank you for being our guest and providing feedback.  I appreciate your suggestions regarding breakfast and we will look into possibly modifying the hours.   We have just had a new Executive Chef join our team and I am sure he will be making changes shortly to our offerings. 

We look forward to your next stay.

Good evening Mrs. Opilka,

Thank you for being our guest and responding to the survey.  I am so glad to see you enjoyed your stay.  Please know I enjoy getting feedback and take it very seriously.  We have a brand new Chef that starts this week and I will insure he looks into the quality and consistency of the cod preparation.  We hope to see you again in the near future and look forward to welcoming you back.

Thank you for being our guest and providing feedback regarding your stay.  It is through feedback that I can assist the team to service our guests better,   Please know I will use your comments in coaching the security staff in handling situations like this in a better way.   I am sure they were trying to balance New Year's Eve and regular noise, as we typically do not get noise issues at the hotel of this kind.  I am so glad to hear you enjoyed the pool and games.  We have added the games in the last year to provide an extra amenity for guests young and old as an activity when we have in climate weather or a busy day.

We look forward to having you as our guest again soon.

Good morning Ms. Grambow

Thank you for being our guest and responding to the survey with comments.   I see you did purchase the breakfast included in your rate, but I am seeing no breakfast charges.  Did you pay at the restaurant?  I am curious in regards to your communication comment.  Might  you be able to provide additional comments so I can use as training for our staff?

2019-01-03 10:17:21] Email received from: Candy G <candycvt@gmail.com>: The restaurant wouldn't let us leave until we either paid or put our room
number on the breakfast bill. We tried to explain to them that the
breakfast should be included with our stay each morning & that we were
concerned we'd be charged again, but they just kept asking us to put our
room number down & ""it'll be fine"". In my opinion, I think there should be
some sort of explanation or ""how to"" instructions for getting our
breakfast... Another words, how does the employees even know it's included
in our reservation? Other hotels give us a breakfast ticket to give to the
hostess when we leave. That would be a nice addition to your facility
policy.
The other communication issue is that we were charged for our stay 2 weeks
in advance without being told that they were charging us, no email
confirming the charge or anything! We noticed the charge on our credit card
statement. When I called, I was told that it was their policy to charge
prior to the visit (still no answers as to why no one told us that or why a
payment confirmation or invoice was emailed). So I had to request an
invoice for that charge.
To sum it all up, had employees just communicated with us, we wouldn't be
in this predicament.

2019-01-05 12:24:10] Reply Sent: Thank you for the comments.  I am sorry the breakfast explanation was confusing.   When your room rate includes breakfast and the server settles the charges for breakfast, our computer systems talk to one another and know not to place the breakfast charge on your room.   We ask that guest sign the check with a room number to verify the charges, if your room did not include breakfast then the charge would have been on your bill.
For weekends that fall over Packer Football games, an advance payment is required.  I apologize if this was not communicated at the time of the reservation being made and I will speak to our reservations team to insure proper verbiage is used.
I appreciate all of your comments and as I stated they will be used for coaching and helping the staff become better with service.
Warm regards,
Kristine

Thank you for being our guest and responding to the survey.  We have discussed as a team and found our policy to be incomplete.  It is certainly not our intention to treat you any differently from stay to stay and I am sorry to hear that this happened.  For future reference, we will allow adults under the age of 21 to check into the hotel as long as the room charges are secured with a credit in the name of the reservation.  At certain times of the year, we might also place restriction on age for the safety and security of all of our guests.  I hope you understand.  We look forward to seeing you again soon.

I do see that one of the managers provided breakfast for your room.  Please know this is not a regular occurrence and something that could not be helped.   Thank you for the comments regarding Max.

It looks as though you had a reservation with Booking.com that included breakfast that had a rate of $247.  That reservation was canceled on 12/27 and another reservation was booked that did not include breakfast with a rate of $132.55.    The $25 you see on you card is a hold for incidentals and it looks as though you did not have any additional charges other than room and tax.  This hold will fall off and not be a charge.  The total charges on your card should be $153.10.  I am sorry you experienced a cold pool area and I will make sure that it is looked into.
Regards,
Kristine

Good afternoon Mr. Liester, 

Thank you for being our guest and responding to the survey,  I appreciate your comments.  Two of our 4 emergency stairwells, keep you inside the building and provide an inside exit to the lobby and one of these two stairwells are accessible for you to return upstairs.  I apologize that you may have been miss informed.  

Thank you for your Food and Beverage comments, not having proper staffing is unacceptable, whether a game day or not and I will speak to our restaurant manager regarding staffing levels.

Please know I treat feedback as a gift and always find a way to use it to  make our operation better. 

Happy New Year!

Thank you for being our guest and providing feedback regarding your stay.   It is through feedback that we make out property better for your next visit.  Out hotel is dated, but we try to keep it looking good for our guests,  In later 2018, we replaced the beds and added the cubie blue (extra plugs & blue tooth speaker) on the nightstand.  We have additional plans coming in 2019.  

We have just hired a new Executive Chef, so I am sure we will be changing gout F&B offerings in the near future.  

Once again thank you for your comments and your loyalty to Hyatt.  We hope to see you again soon!

Warm regards,
Kristine

Thank you for being our guest and responding to the survey.  We continue to make improvements to the property although we have not had a full renovation.  We have just finished, the Front Desk, Market and Business Center areas as well as replaced all of ht the beds in the hotel.  (little changes I know)  

You comments regarding the beer and beverage menus is already in the works.  We have a new restaurant manager and she is one it!  We will be making changes to the draft beer and menu creation is underway.  

We hope you visit again soon and will see the continuous changes we make to create a great stay experience for each guest.
