"Couple of items, the temperature in our room, 832, would not warm up, it was around 67 deg the entire stay. The fan ran constantly and was fairly loud. I did not mention during our stay because I didnâ€™t want the hassle of someone in and out of our room, and or having to change rooms. The next was a leak in the main roof outside of our room in the corner of the courtyard near room 832, water was dripping pretty fast. This did not effect us as it was outside our room but not a great look for the hotel. We did the buffet, the food was very mediocre, i thought the potatoes were cold and greasy. The omlettes and fruit were good. It took quite a while to get our bill even though it was it not overly crowded. if we stay here again we will not eat the buffet. As long as I am filling this out I will mention the parking, validating the parking all the time is a pain, canâ€™t it somehow be piggyback with the room key.","Very Negative"
"The food in the restaurant was over salted, under cooked and some of it was cold. We waited for more than an hour to be served once our order was placed. The staff was nice and the manager came out and apologized but never once did he ever offer us any sort of compensation. Maybe a free dessert or drinks or even a % off the bill.  Unsatisfactory, will not eat there again, they have lost our service for stays in the future.","Very Negative"
"We ordered room service - which we rarely do.  When we checked out, we were surprised there was a $13.19 buffet charge on our $43.80 breakfast room service bill (for which we had a receipt).  Not sure if someone erroneously charged a buffet meal to our room or ???  It was corrected, but in the future we probably won't put our credit card on file for ""incidentals"" to avoid this.  Also, hoping the room we were in will get its table back.  Was awkward to eat without it.","Negative"
"Disappointed that someone knocked on our door Christmas morning @ 8:06 am to clean room. We told them to come back. Then we also told the front desk attendant that we would like our room cleaned while we were out for a good 7 hours from 11AM to 6 PM. We came back to an unattended room.   We checked in on Sunday before Christmas  and left Wednesday after Christmas .","Negative"

"Wonderful stay!  We stopped in the bar our first night and it was pretty dead in there (right before Christmas), but the bartender was awesome and we all watched Elf together :)
The room was great as usual, just like I remembered from my childhood, but updated!
We didn't have the breakfast there because it's a bit different than we remembered.  It's now an additional charge to the room and the set up is different.  I'm sure it's tasty but we opted out of it.","Very_Positive"
"I wasnâ€™t notified about $7 parking fee until check in. Couldnâ€™t find anything about it on website nor was the info provided when making the reservation. This is first experience Iâ€™ve had with any hotel where they werenâ€™t upfront about parking costs online and during reservation process.","Very Negative"
"We specifically asked at check in what time breakfast was served and the desk person said 7 am to 10 am.  We got to the buffet at 9:30 the next morning and we're told it cloed at 9:30 and they would not serve us.  When I complained at checkout the girl at the desk said, ""I'm sorry about that.  Our breakfast is really good!"". Not pleased with the misinformation and the response I got.","Negative"

"Our visit  was an annual family Christmas stay, a big splurge for us!  Everyone enjoys the comforts of the Hyatt. Unfortunately this year the hot tub was cold and did not get to enjoy it. One of the big things looked forward to using during our stay.","Negative"
"Thanks.  Biggest issue I had was that my room was immediately off the elevator bank.  Because the elevators still have the old fashioned bell/ding when selecting the floor in the elevator and audible from the elevator lobby, I was constantly hearing it in my room as well.  I could even hear it from the bedroom.  Isn't there a way to upgrade the notifier system to use a more discreet or subtle ring?","Negative"

"upgrading to higher, elongated toilets would be a great upgrade in the bathrooms","Neutral"
"Incredible room for the money! Nice perks in the room, too. Only complaint would be wish staff would have understood more about what they offered for breakfast. Was disappointed at the lack of a continental breakfast.","Positive_But_Critical"
"This was the worst stay I have ever had!  Room 330 should not be available to your guests! Also who ever was at the front desk on the night of 12/14/18 and 12/15/18 early morning should be fired. The noise in the main hotel area went on until 11:30 that night and the outside noise until 2:00 am. I understand this is Green Bay were most people don't have a clue! But really, this is a Hyatt Regency!","Very Negative"

"check in staff was great, place was beautiful.  Check in staff did tell us to bring parking ticket in to get validated, told her we left it in car, she said we needed it, so the next morning we went to the car and brought it in, waited in line for same girl to tell us we didn't need to validate on the weekend, so that is one area that could be improved, all told about a 20 minute waste of time.   Room was great, nice set up.  Upon walking in the first thing we saw was a dirty cleaning rag left over the chair back.  There was also urine on the bottom of the toilet on the side, but otherwise clean.","Negative"
"The customer service staff are very friendly during check-in. Lindsay has been extremely helpful for all of my stays this year when booking my rooms.  Very accommodating when changes needed to be made. Emma has been very helpful with my room requests as well.  She really does well.","Very_Positive"
"Great spot. A bit of a ""seasoned"" property but it is well maintained. Parking and validation could improve by using the door key as the in/ out ticket.","Neutral"
"Why no coffee anywhere in the hotel until after 7:00 on a Saturday morning?","Negative"
"The hotel was dark and cold and very dated. I could not believe this was a Hyatt property. Even the lobby was cold.","Negative"
"As a business hotel with corporate rates would be awesome to have breakfast before 6:30 am, but otherwise the prices of the market was reasonable though maybe a coupon to those who check it before breakfast which is included in the rate would be appreciated.","Neutral"

"Nice Hotel.  But the common area was loud.  Which was surprising since the hotel seemed empty.  Again no offer for an upgrade at this property for Globalist.  In fact my Bedroom TV wasn't even the typical large TV.  It was like a Computer Monitor.  Just surprised I never get an offer at this property.  Free Parking was nice and the Breakfast was good as well.","Neutral"
"I made the reservation for Wednesday 12-5 showed up on 12-5 and the check in said I was a NO SHOW last night 12-4. I said sorry the reservation was for 12-5 not 12-4. He indicated he corrected the Hyatt system and I would not be charged for the 12-4 no show. As I checked out I was charged for the NO SHOW and the 12-5 night I stayed. I had to go through the entire process all over again and will be looking for the credit on my account.

The buffet breakfast was the WORST I have experienced in a long time. Bad eggs, Bad cereal selections, un ripe fruit bad service, stale bread. A Very lame attempt at breakfast.","Very Negative"

"The price of the breakfast and the charge for parking were surprisingly high.  I would have expected the hotel to validate parking at least.","Negative"
"Almost everything was great. The room was spacious and well appointed. The only issue we had was with the temperature. When we got to the room it was 72 degrees so I tried to turn it down to 65. After about a hour my husband looked at the thermostat and it was at 74 so it was going up instead of down. We called the front desk and were told that they would have to contact the engineers to turn the heat off to our room and they gave us a fan. I assumed that it would be taken care of the next day but no luck. Thankfully the fan was large and did the job while we were sleeping!","Positive_But_Critical"
"Bed could be a little more comfortable. And, need real refrigerators, not these 45 degree â€œcoolersâ€","Positive_But_Critical"
"I am a huge fan of this hotel and have stayed here(GB Hyatt)  about 15 nights in the past 1 - 2 years. I am usually very impress overall, but this time was not my best experience. The hotel was not very busy and parking lot nearly empty for my entire stay. I was checked in to a room with construction going on right above me and I heard a lot of construction noise early and throughout the day as I was working.  There was also a blue crane that was extended right in front of my window.  Since there was hardly anyone in the hotel I was surprised they put me in this room. I didn't ask to be moved.  The carpet in my room was buckling and needs to be stretched.  The staff in the restaurant (breakfast) was also ignoring the guests as they stood at the front and talked.  I had to get up and ask for a menu, got to them to ask for water, then a refill and then go up and ask for my bill.  My eggs were also under cooked (ordered poached medium- no issue with them being under cooked, that happens and is not big deal) and I waited for someone to come and see how things were so I could reorder, but no one ever did (that was the issue-poor service). Each time I went up to ask for service the young ladies were very nice, but they clearly were more interested in talking to each other than in taking care of the guests. The person at the front desk (the one that checked me out for my stay) also needs to work on her customer service.  I saw her a few times during my stay and she never smiles, says hello or greets the guests, didn't ask how my stay was, etc  She was very cold and not very friendly and not typical of the Hyatt Staff I have net over the course of my stays.  I'm hoping this is not her usual demeanor and she was just ""off"".  
Like I said earlier, I am a huge fan of the hotel and am only sharing this for constructive purposes.  In general my hop is that the GB Hyatt is not slipping and that on my next stay the service will be improved.

"Emma Asst Front Desk Mgr did a great job accommodating my wife and I during a recent 5 day stay!","Very_Positive"
"Hotel was outdated but obviously they were working on that. Staff couldn't have cared less about our stay. Mumbled a lot. I was looking for a late night snack for my wife that wasn't feeling well. Just some pretzels. Found some at the market by the front desk. $2.10 for a 1 ounce .50 bag of pretzels. Wow! 1 ounce of pretzels. I was going to get 2, but when I heard the cost,  I said I can't pay that for a little bag of pretzels, i got no response from the hostess. She didn't even look up from the computer screen. I know she can't change prices, but even a ""I'm sorry"" would have been better than complete indifference. The nakeup of the hotel was good, so with some updating and a staff that cares, the potential is there.","Negative"
"The hotel room was excellent and the staff was very friendly.  Met friends from out of town and we were very pleased with our overall stay and proximity to walking to events.  The parking was not a big deal although I think that should have been explained when booking. Breakfast was good however, I feel there should be an inclusion with price of room.  Overall stay was A+ and would stay again.","Very_Positive"
"In my opinion the staff was very friendly, although they did not ask if I wanted to pay cash or put on my card I had on account.. Housekeeping was great! But you need to hire 2-4 men to move those couches and clean underneath them.  And the mattress on the fold out bed could be replaced it sages.","Neutral"
"Bar serves Wine opened 3 days ago and is awful. Asked for fresh bottle and still got 3 day old stuff. Paying big bucks per glass and deserve a fresh bottle rather than old wine getting pawned off.","Negative"
"Great hotel. Window blinds need to be closer to the wall as a lot of light into the room. Staff was very welcoming. Sofa bed mattress could be better or a better cover to add on. Would stay again!","Positive_But_Critical"

"Everyone at the hotel was very nice and most of our room were very good. The part that was really disgusted was that the comforter on the pull-out couch was rolled in a ball inside the couch and soiled with urine and feces. It was absolutely vile and it ruined our stay at your hotel. We left a note for housekeeping to replace it, which they did, but it was hard to get past.","Negative"
"The exterior of the hotel is not inviting - and the inside is dark.  All of the staff were very warm and welcoming!  The room is nice; however, needs some updating.  The doors on the inside of the room are very outdated and worn for wear.  The counters and bathroom updates are very nice.  Maybe consider more uplifting colors other than dark brown.  I did feel safe and relaxed here and that is very important, thank you!","Neutral"
"Parking charges are difficult to find on the site.  The $7 per day charge is unreasonable for green bay.  Had problems with the gate system every time I left the hotel.  Lobby reeked of smoke due to large group of smokers right outside the door.  Will not be back","Negative"
"Our whole stay was phenomenal.  We experienced Teresa at the restaurant two different time, both of which were top notch!  Excellent service from start to finish for our entire stay!","Very_Positive"
"Air Conditions too loud. 
Furniture for a Hyatt Hotel too shabby","Negative"
"Love it staff is fabulous","Very_Positive"
"The reason for 5 under customer service is that I requested a couple of days ago that Hyatt ships a laptop charger that I forgot in my room when I checked out...  They promised to make arrangements but nothing precipitated thus far...  Guess I'll have to call and inquire again... Not good.","Negative"
"First thing my wife does upon entering any hotel is to pull the sheets back.  Crawling around under the top sheet near the headboard were two ants; my wife freaked out; after I disposed of them I volunteered to take that bed.  She took the other queen, but not until she removed all bedding and inspected first.
Very creepy to find ants in the bed; and for $300 + , and no breakfast included. Really?
Room 234","Negative"
"I've stayed in much nicer areas in more expensive locations for a fraction of the cost. It's JUST Green Bay over looking a parking lot, it's not worth the $$. LA-cheaper, Las Vegas- Cheaper, Niagara Falls-cheaper, Ocean view on a mountain side in northern Washington-cheaper! and that's JUST the US...

Other than the over priced room, the hotel was clean, comfortable, and the staff was very nice.","Very Negative"
"I booked this stay with my Hyatt points so this was an award night but I was very disappointed with the condition of our room.  I sat down to take it easy and watch tv however there was no picture only sound on the set.  I then decided to brew a cup of coffee and found that the bar sink faucet was plugged up so no water there.  My wife came out shortly from the bathroom and told me the drain was nearly plugged.  We could barely look out the sliding glass door in the bedroom since the inner seal was obviously broken and the glass was fogged between the glass panels.  Not what I expected from a luxury hotel!  The staff was pleasant but instead of addressing the issues, only told me I should have said something earlier.  Wish I had saved my points and stayed elsewhere.","Very Negative"
"The hotel was under construction. The shuttle was not available during my stay, except for the last day and had to incur additional unplanned expense because it was not available. I thought breakfast was included with our corporate rate, and learned it was not. On a positive note, my bed was EXTREMELY comfortable and the TVs in my room exceeded my expectations (the large-screen in the bedroom was wonderful!)","Negative"
"The stairs in the convention center are rather steep.  Escalator would have been nicer.","Neutral"
"We had great discussions with many of the staff throughout our stay! We met some of the cooks, Miguel, Steve and Manny who were a delight. Bill was setting up for a lunch and even started conversation with us. Linda a housekeeper was kind. Stacey in the pub entertained us since we were the only one in there on a Sunday night. Every staff member we met was amazing! Checking was smooth, the hotel is gorgeous. The mattresses and pillows were so comfortable to sleep on. I definitely will recommend Hyatt to friends, family and coworkers.","Very_Positive"
"I was going to speak with someone the morning I checked out but there was a line of people.  My room was FREEZING.  The thermometer didn't work and I had the heat turned up to 76 and froze.  I was in room 330 and didn't sleep all night due to the fact that I was freezing.  I used the extra blanket and in the middle of the night got up and put bath towels on me.  I was desperate and probably should've called down for another blanket.  I felt that the room was very outdated and dirty.  But that I can live with...the freezing cold was rough.  Needless to say, I got a horrible night sleep and checked out at 8 in the morning.","Negative"
"Check out was slow because of the parking ticket..had to stand in a long line to get it validated","Negative"
"We were very pleased with our stay and room at the Hyatt Regency and would stay again when in the area. The Hotel was lovely and our room was very comfortable and had all the extras we have not experienced at other hotels. The value for the price we paid was outstanding compared to other hotels we have stayed that are considered high end. Absolutely satisfied with the Hyatt Regency!","Very_Positive"
"I love the set up of the room, how you walk into the living space first, then the bathroom, then the bedroom. I wish more hotels did this","Very_Positive"
"The guest rooms were much too hot, and the windows/sliding door should have had screens. The free breakfast was sorely missed. The elevators are extremely slow. The room keys kept inactivating.","Negative"
"We expected a 3 pm check in, and our rooms weren't ready until 6:30. We would like a partial refund.","Negative"
"There seemed to be a motor running - a very loud one, that was not coming from inside the room.  It would kick in every few minutes and run for about 15-30 seconds.  I thought it was maybe the elevator room nearby, but that also did not seem to be the case.  Either way, it did not make for a very tranquil stay.","Negative"
"I was there for a wedding. Check-in went very smooth and told me that I was able to stay in the room for both nights. I got a call on Saturday while I was in the middle of setting up a wedding upstairs and was told I had to move rooms. It was a very inconvenient time and I could not move rooms. The wedding was less than an hour away and I had my hotel room filled. I was able to stay in the room but thought it was a very bad time for them to do that. 
It was impossible to have breakfast downstairs with any larger wedding group.  they didn't have the room for us and kept letting other people in ahead of us so we had to wait well over half an hour for all of us to eat. 
On the positive side it is a gorgeous location, staff was as friendly and accommodating as possible, very clean and we would stay again.","Negative"
"I decided to stay here with some friends for a night away. I decided to use points for the room. I feel it was a wasted because there were so many issues with my stay!","Negative"
"I felt bad for the staff. We arrived around 3 wanting to rest before the evening but a room was not available yet. So we went to the bar. At 4 there was still no room, at 5 still no room.

"As a breastfeeding mother staying at the Hyatt for a conference, I was extremely disappointed in the lack of accommodation. When I went to check in (earlier than the actual check in time) I explained that I would like a space to pump before my room was ready. I was told there were no options unless I paid an upgrade fee. This was not a feasible option. No private space was provided to me so I had to pump on the bathroom floor in a handicap stall. I do believe I could've been provided with a private space to pump and that accommodation was not made. I was incredibly upset at this situation.","Negative"

At 4:30 I went back up and they offered me a room with 1 king bed.  I declined. I went up again at 5:40 and was told it was ready only to find out it was the room with 1 king bed.  There was no compensation for the late check in or the wrong room.  I would not go back even though the room was nice and breakfast was good.","Negative"

The 4 of us hadn't showered, etc... The 4 of us dressed in the bathroom!  I went to the desk at 7 pm, and was told by the clerk""your room is ready"", ""didn't someone text you?"".
