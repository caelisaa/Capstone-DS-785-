Thank you for being our guest and responding with feedback.  It is through feedback that we make our hotel better.  Please know I will have Engineering look into the AC unit in 832.  The roof leak that you saw is known and it is from the skylight.  This time of year unfortunately it can not be fixed due to the drying of the caulk and the temperatures outside.  I know it is unsightly and will be fixed as soon as possible.   Today we are excited that we are welcoming our new Executive Chef to the team.   I am certain on your next visit you will see improvement in food and beverage.  

Have a safe and happy New Year, we look forward to welcoming you back in 2019!

That was a very nice gesture and he was genuinely concerned for my wife's illness. Thank You,614 very small bathrooms but clean and presentable. However there were potato chips in the fold out couch and one of the sheets was ripped when we put them on the mattress. As for the rest of the room it was satisfactory.,"3three3
Meals particularly the chicken pot pie, very soupy and undercooked. It was extremely salty and the crust was undercooked and gooey. Our meal took more than an hour to be served.

Thank you for being our guest and responding to the survey.   I treat feedback as a gift and appreciate your comments.  I understand you spoke to Carrie at check-out and that she has provided 2,000 World of Hyatt points for your food and beverage experience.  I do agree that the restaurant manager should have done something for you and I will have a coaching conversation with him.  We are excited that today to welcome a new Executive Chef to the team and I am sure on your next stay you will see improved food & beverage offerings.  It is also nice to hear the front office staff helped in providing you medicine when in need.  

I hope the next time your travels bring you to Green Bay that you choose to stay with us as we would enjoy welcoming you back.

Have a safe and happy new year!

Thank you for responding, I am not sure what happened but this is the first response I have gotten from the e-mail I sent in late December.  I am crediting back 1 night’s stay today to the card we have on file.   I was not sure if you wanted the points or credit so have just been awaiting a response.
Now that the credit it complete to the card you should see it in at the beginning of the week.
I apologize for any additional inconvenience.
Have a great weekend!

Thank you for being our guest and responding to the survey.  Just a quick question, you gave us a low score on tranquility and was wondering is you might provide some comments regarding tranquility?  I am glad to see you enjoyed your stay over all and I hope you have a Happy Holiday.

Thank you for being our guest.  I am sorry to hear about issues with finding our parking charges listed on line.  If you are using the World of Hyatt App, it is difficult as the 'free parking"" is grayed out.  On the main website the charges are listed under ""Map, Parking & Transportation"" .  We certainly try to be upfront about all of our charges and I will check to see if we can make them more prominent on the App.    Thank you for the feedback, it is through feedback we can make our hotel and services better for all of our guests.  

We hope to see you as our guest again soon!

Good evening Mr. Zarling, 

Thank you for being our guest!  I am so sorry to hear that you were given misinformation.  Please know I will review all of the information with the staff.  On weekends and over the holidays, we change our end times to accommodate guests sleeping in late and it looks as though we had so internal communication issues.  I agree the answer given could also have been more guest focused and maybe provided you with snacks and coffee from the market.  We always have options.  I hope next tie you are in the Green Bay area you return back to Hyatt and allow us an opportunity to show you better guest interactions.

We hope to see you soon!

Sincerely,

Kristine

Thank you for being our guest.  I apologize with the holiday I am a little behind in responding to surveys.  It will be great to have you stay with us again and I hope that you enjoy the next stay as well.  One of my colleagues, read your comments and you hopefully got your extra pillows today.  I am going to put a note in your history profile to always place 2 extra pillows in your room for future stays.

We appreciate your loyalty to Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

Thank you for being our guest and providing feedback.  It is through feedback that we make our service and product better.  I will definitely look into the elevator ""ding"".  The reason for the sound is for person with disabilities so I am not sure much can be done, it does sound louder with the Atrium.  I am glad you found the bed comfy as we just replaced them all in the last 6 months, we continue to upgrade the property over time.  Please know I will also follow up with the front desk for service recognition and maybe even create a key drop box for expedited service.  I love our queso as well and as for the brandy old fashion, it is the drink of Green Bay, YUM!

We hope to see you again for another visit.

Warm regards,
Kristine

We are in the business of care so to me areas of Check-in, customer service and food & beverage are the touch points of care.

Thank you for being our guest and providing feedback.   I treat feedback as a gift and use it to make our hotel and service better.    I appreciate you comment for coffee earlier than 7am and have been in discussions with the team to see how many requests we have on the weekends.  We are looking into our breakfast area offering coffee earlier or even extending our Market hours.   We hope to see you again soon.  Thank you for being a loyal World of Hyatt member.

Happy Holidays!

Thank you for being our guest and providing feedback on your stay.   It is through feedback that we continuously make changes to provide a better product and service for our guests.  I am sorry to hear that you found the hotel dated and cold.  We have just updated a few areas around the hotel such as The Market, front desk area, new beds in all our guest rooms.   Hopefully on your next stay you will even see more improvements.   Thank you for being a World of Hyatt member.  We look forward to welcoming you back again soon.

Thank you for being our recent guest and providing feedback regarding your stay.  it is through feedback that we make our property and staff better for future stays.    Please know I will have Engineering check on the room you stayed in and insure all items are fixed.  Our Market just reopened with a new food delivery option in late November.  The Italian sandwich is one of the new offerings.  I will have the oven settings checked making sure it is heating the sandwich completely. 
 
We hope to see you as a guest in the future. I wish you a happy holiday season.

2018-12-10 12:50:38] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good afternoon Mr. Timm,

Thank you for being our guest last week and filling out a survey.  I treat feedback as a gift in hopes that it will make our team and hotel stronger.   I am sorry to hear that you feel as though you are never upgraded here in Green Bay.  We are lucky that all of our rooms are suites.  I see that most often you book a 2-queen bedded suite.  The only option for an upgrade with 2-queen beds is an executive suite and we only have 3 in the hotel.  Our king bedded upgrade options are a little more plentiful with a custom king of which we have 19 and an executive suite where we have three.   Even at low occupancy they rooms sell out most days.  

In regards to parking, Globalists are entitled to free parking when using their points for a stay.  I am glad to see the host provided complimentary parking when they neglected to share parking options for you at check-in.  

Thank you for the compliments of breakfast and the staff I will certainly pass them on to the staff.

We appreciate your business and look forward to your next stay.  

Warm regards,
Kristine

Thank you for being guest last week.  I view feedback as a gift and truly appreciate your comments regarding the no-show charge and breakfast.  I have double checked you account and indeed the charge was credited total charged to your card was $110.53, I will use this as coaching for our check-in agents to adjust these charges immediately when there is an error.  In regards to breakfast please know I will speak to the staff regarding the quality of product such as fruit and bread and insure we provide only the best for our guests.  With regard to selection It is hard to provide too many options but is there a particular brand you would suggest that we might have on hand for your next visit?

Please know we work each and every day to exceed our guest's expectations and I am sorry we let you down.  I hope the next time you visit you will see changes to our follow-up and product standards.  

We look forward to welcoming you back soon!  

Please reach out if I can be of assistance in the future.

Warm regards,
Kristine

Thank you for being our guest.  It was a pleasure to have you as our guest.  I am sorry we missed the mark on your sleeping comfort, it is certainly a personal preference.  We have just replaced the beds in all guest rooms in the last 3 months.   The ""coolers"" are real refrigerators.  We have many guests that need medical storage for medicine and after testing several of the units, we chose to place the highest temperature on the front so guests were informed.   They certainly do the service of keeping drinks, etc. cold.  

We look forward to your next stay and look forward to welcoming you back.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for being a Discoverist with World of Hyatt; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I sincerely apologize for the issues you have experienced during your most recent stay. We do generally place our VIP World of Hyatt guests on higher floors, as those are preferred rooms, and unfortunately during your stay the room occupied was one of the best available in the room category. However, I do apologize for the construction that was occurring above your room during your stay; please know that at any time during your stays, we can certainly accommodate a room move if available, as your comfort is a priority for us. I will share your feedback with our Outlets team regarding the service and condition of the eggs you were served at breakfast. Please also know that the colleague who checked you out does have the best of intentions; she is an asset to our team, and I apologize if her usually stellar service was not conveyed in the interaction that occurred at check-out. We will use your feedback as coaching opportunities with our teams, so that we may better fulfill our guest's needs. I would also like to personally invite you back, so that we may have another chance to provide excellent care, service, and products. 

Thank you again for your time and feedback. If there is anything I can do to assist you, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for being a Member of World of Hyatt with us. Your feedback is appreciated, as guest feedback is our most useful tool in our continued growth and improvement. I wanted to inquire about any other details you may be able to provide about your stay - I understand you felt that we fell short on some details in your guest room, and I was wondering if you could provide us with examples so that we may focus on this as an area of growth. I apologize for any ways in which you may have been inconvenienced, and we do hope to see you again soon so that we may have a second chance to surpass expectations.

If there is anything I can assist you with, or if you would like to provide additional details, please feel free to contact me.

Every time I stay there, the staff really treats myself and my girlfriend great. There were just very minor things I noticed in my room. The bath tube had a screw coming out of the faucet, and the top of the cabinet were the microwave sits has not been dusted in quit awhile.  That was very noticeable.  But like I said Very minor things that I noticed myself. But yes we will definitely be back. You guys treat everyone great from the time we checked in to the time we checked out. Sent from my Verizon, Samsung Galaxy smartphone

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I sincerely apologize for the negative interactions you had while you were staying with us; it is our goal to provide genuine care to each guest, and it is very clear from your responses that we missed the mark. I will certainly be using this as a coaching opportunity for my staff. I assure you that they are a great group, and are capable of achieving much more than was displayed. I appreciate your feedback so that I may address this with my team and pass along your feedback to our Outlets team as well. We do hope to see you again, so that we may have a second chance to show you the type of care, service, and product we strive to provide to each and every guest.

If there is anything I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey. Feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I apologize for the issues you had with our Pub 333. I will advise that they were following standard procedure, following any and all legal food & beverage regulations - we do date each bottle upon opening and reseal to ensure the best shelf life, discarding the wine after 7 days. However, we are able to open other bottles if needed and I apologize if that did not happen upon request. I was also the one who checked you out, and as we discussed, I have already reimbursed you $30 for the glasses of wine that were not up to standard. I will resend your folio if you have not received it for verification of this credit. Again, we thank you for your time and feedback.

If there is anything else I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I see we may have fallen short in some areas during your stay, and I wanted to inquire about any additional details you may be able to provide us, so that we may use this as a coaching opportunity for all of our staff members. Any feedback you have is much appreciated. Again, I thank you for your time and look forward to hearing from you!

If there is anything I can do to assist you, or if you would like to provide those details, please feel free to contact me directly.

We certainly appreciate your feedback, and I will be passing this along to our Culinary/Outlets leadership so that we may improve upon this. However, I am glad to see that you had positive interactions with our staff, and we do hope to see you back again soon, so that we may have a second chance to exceed expectations.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I was the staff member you spoke with last night after our Housekeeping team members had left for the day regarding your charger. I did send your information to our Housekeeping department, who is currently making arrangements to have your charger sent back to you. I apologize for any delay; we do value our guest's time when it comes to getting items back, however, they were needed this morning on the guest floors to assist the Room Attendants. Please rest assured that we are aware of this and your charger will be on its way to you shortly; one of our Housekeeping supervisors will be in touch to get any information and get your charger to you.

If there is anything else I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me. 

Best wishes,

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I sincerely apologize for the issues you had within your guest room; please know that this will be thoroughly investigated, and that our Housekeeping team does do a full cleaning of the rooms before they are occupied, taking extra care of the details. This is certainly below our standards and I assure you, an isolated incident. I have credited $50 back to the card on file for this issue. I do understand the rate for your guest room was higher than it typically is; our rates for this weekend were higher due to the home Packer game, and are reflective of other hotels in the area. I would like to personally invite you back should you ever find yourself in Green Bay; myself and our Executive Housekeeper are happy to personally walk the room to ensure that it is up to Hyatt standards. Thank you again for your time and feedback.

If there is anything else I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me directly.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. Please know that our rates the weekend you were with us were reflective of limited inventory during a Packer home game weekend, in line with other hotels in the area. However, I am glad to see that you enjoyed your guest room, as well as your interactions with our staff. I do hope the wedding was lovely, and we hope to see you again soon!

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for being a Member of World of Hyatt with us. Your loyalty is appreciated, and I apologize that this last stay has disappointed you. I can certainly understand your frustration regarding these issues in your guest room, and your feedback will be shared with our Engineering team. I do also apologize for how this was handled; we appreciate your feedback regardless of timing, however, we would like the opportunity to fix these items for you so that you do not have to stay in a room that does not meet expectations. That being said, I have submitted 2,000 points into your World of Hyatt account as recompense for the issues you experienced. It may take a few business days for this to process and reflect in your World of Hyatt account. I would also like to personally welcome you back in the future, and both myself as well as the Executive Housekeeper for our property will inspect the room prior to check-in to ensure it is one that will exceed expectations.

If there is anything I can do to assist you, or if you would like me to arrange anything for a future stay, please feel free to contact me directly.

Best wishes,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for being a Discoverist with us. Your loyalty is recognized and appreciated; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I apologize for the issues you experienced regarding the room service food. I understand how impressions like this can impact a stay, and I will pass this along to our Outlets team for consideration. I will also make a note on your profile, so that for any future stays we can be aware of this preference and respond accordingly. I did notice that we scored low in other areas of your stay as well, and I was wondering if you had any additional details you'd like to provide. We certainly want to extend genuine service and care to each guest, and I apologize if this was not conveyed to you. Any feedback you may have is very valuable to us. Thank you again for your time, we hope to see you again soon!

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. We appreciate guest feedback as it is utilized as an opportunity for growth and improvement for different areas of our hotel. The KI Convention Center does provide an elevator on the 1st floor right below the stairs for guest convenience. I apologize if this was not properly communicated with you and if it made your overall experience unsatisfactory. Please know that we will keep in consideration for future conventions and events.  I am pleased that you had a positive experience with the guest rooms and staff interactions. Additionally, please let me know if you have any additional details from your food and beverage experience as it looks like we missed the mark in this area. Thank you, and we look forward to welcoming you back to the Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I sincerely apologize for the call during an inconvenient time. I take the blame for that; I was the one who checked you in and extended the ADA room for both days. I believe we had a guest arriving the next day who needed an ADA room, and due to my mistake, we did not have one for them, which is why you got the call discussing the room move. Again, I apologize for this oversight and for any inconvenience it caused you. We will also be using the breakfast experience as a coaching opportunity for our Outlets staff, I understand how such a wait can cause frustration. However, I am so glad to see that you enjoyed most of your stay, and we hope to see you again soon!

I sincerely apologize for the issues you experienced during your stay, including the late check-in, leaky patio door, and the confusion with the late check-out. I will certainly use this as a coaching opportunity for my staff, so that they are aware of precisely what benefits are available to our Discoverists. We do appreciate your loyalty, and your status as a Discoverist with us. I will be crediting your account 2,000 World of Hyatt points for these issues, as I understand how frustrating this can be. Please allow a few business days for these points to reflect in your account. Again, I thank you for your time and feedback, and apologize for the areas in which we missed the mark during this stay. We do hope to see you again soon, so that we may have another chance to show you the care, service, and product we strive to provide.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I sincerely apologize for the heating issues in your room, and if our staff made it appear as if we were blowing off the issue. I will certainly be using this as a coaching opportunity with both our Front Office staff and Engineering team, so that we may better address the needs of our guests. We absolutely want to extend care to each guest, and it is clear to me that we missed the mark during your stay. Again, I apologize for these issues, and I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. We do hope to see you again, so that we may have a second chance to show you the care, service, and product we strive to provide to each guest.

If there is anything I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me.

The overall hotel was in OK condition but it is starting to show its age. The elevator system is terrible. 4 elevators serving eight floors but the elevators are very slow and sometimes would not respond to a call button. Breakfast is served in the lobby and you can hear all the dishes being loaded on the shelves from your room first thing in the morning.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I'm so glad to see that you enjoyed most of your stay, I apologize for the broken hanger that was in your room. I will certainly pass along this feedback to our Housekeeping department as an area we can take a closer look at. I also wanted to inquire about your food and beverage experience; I see that we didn't quite meet expectations, and I was wondering if you had any additional details you would like to provide, so that we may improve. Again, I thank you for your time and feedback, and I look forward to hearing from you!

If there is anything I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I sincerely apologize that accommodations were not provided for you to pump in. I will be using this as a coaching opportunity for my staff; even if guest rooms were not available, there were certainly other spaces we could have provided, and the fact that these were not extended to you is very disappointing. If you do have any future stays with us, please reach out to myself or our Front Office Manager, Kristin, if your needs are not met, and we'd be happy to find a suitable private space for you to pump. We want to provide the utmost care to each of our guests, and we very clearly missed the mark during your stay. Again, I apologize and thank you for bringing this to our attention. We do hope to see you again so that we may have a second chance to provide the care and service we strive for.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I sincerely apologize for the delay at check-in when getting you into your room. I understand that this was very frustrating, and regardless of the circumstances there is no excuse. However, I am glad to see that you enjoyed the condition of your guest room as well as the breakfast buffet. I see that the Wrestling Coaches conference will be with us again next year, and we do hope to see you again, so that we may have a second chance to extend the care, service, and product we strive to provide.

I would like to thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding the delay in your check-in.  I am sorry there wasn't more acknowledgement on the effect the delay had on your stay.  Our staff did not realize the automatic texting system did not notify you when your room became ready which caused a further delay in receiving your room keys.  Your time is valuable and I agree there should be compensation for the inconvenience.  I realize you would prefer a phone call but I am currently working overnights and will not be in the office during the day.  I did not want you to have to wait for my schedule to shift to daytime hours.  I would like to extend $50 off your room rate as reimbursement, or if you would like I could enroll you in our World of Hyatt membership program and credit 2,500 points.  I look forward to hearing from you and hope the inability to provide an early check-in or hotel dedicated check-in time does not deter you from returning to join us for next year's wrestling coach convention.

Warm Regards,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I sincerely apologize for the delay in getting you checked into your room. I understand how frustrating this was, and despite the circumstance there is no excuse. Please also know that this issue has been addressed within the program we use for the text messages - I apologize that it malfunctioned in getting a text to you, I understand the system was working properly through most of the day, and we are looking into why some guests did not receive the text messages sent out. I understand the Wrestling Coaches conference will be with us again next year, and we do hope to see you again so that we may have a second chance at showing the care, service, and product we strive to provide.

If there is anything I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me.

I was wondering if you would be able to provide specific details with your dining experience as it seems to be rated lower than the rest. I apologize if your overall stay was less than satisfactory and if we fell short with the guest rooms or customer service.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I sincerely apologize for the issues you experienced both in your guest room and with the banquet food. I will certainly be passing along your feedback to our Culinary team; food of that caliber is not at all how we present ourselves, and it's disappointing that we let you down as our guest. I am also concerned regarding the carpeting on which you cut your foot. I did want to inquire whether or not a staff member was informed of this injury? Guest safety and security is our number one priority, and we would have liked to assist you with this as well as remedy the issue that caused it. I appreciate you bringing it to our attention now, but I do hope that all is well with your foot. I again would like to thank you for your time and feedback, and apologize for our shortcomings. We do hope to see you again soon, so that we may have a second chance at showing you the care, service, and product we strive to provide.

I tried to hold the door open for my friend and ended up cutting my middle finger and getting a fairly large splinter inserted into that finger. These are areas that you may want to have your maintenance staff check out.

Subject: Your recent stay at Hyatt Regency Green Bay 
Good afternoon Mr. Erickson, 
Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I sincerely apologize for the issues you experienced both in your guest room and with the banquet food. I will certainly be passing along your feedback to our Culinary team; food of that caliber is not at all how we present ourselves, and it's disappointing that we let you down as our guest. I am also concerned regarding the carpeting on which you cut your foot. I did want to inquire whether or not a staff member was informed of this injury? Guest safety and security is our number one priority, and we would have liked to assist you with this as well as remedy the issue that caused it. I appreciate you bringing it to our attention now, but I do hope that all is well with your foot. I again would like to thank you for your time and feedback, and apologize for our shortcomings. We do hope to see you again soon, so that we may have a second chance at showing you the care, service, and product we strive to provide. 
If there is anything I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me directly. 
Best wishes,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I apologize for the ways in which we fell short during your stay this year. I will certainly be passing along your feedback regarding the delivery of our room service orders to our Outlets department, and will be using your comments regarding check-in to coach my own staff. I'm sorry that you were not properly informed of breakfast options and the best way to get to your room upon arrival. We want every guest to have a pleasant, easy stay with us and clearly we missed the mark. Again, I thank you for your time and feedback, and we do hope to see you again next year so that we may have another chance to show you the care, service, and product we strive to provide.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I sincerely apologize for the issues you experienced regarding the down comforter and pillows during your stay. Please know that we do have all feather free products available if notified, and our housekeeping staff can prepare this in advance to accommodate any allergies. I apologize if this was communicated and your blanket was not also replaced. For any future stays, please reach out to me directly and I will ensure that we have prepared a feather free room for your arrival. However, I am glad to see that you enjoyed our staff and breakfast buffet. We hope to see you again soon!

If there is anything I can do to assist you, or if you would like me to arrange a feather free room for any future stays, please contact me directly.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I sincerely apologize for the issues you experienced during your stay. I appreciate you bringing to our attention the condition of the ceiling in your room. I will be relaying this to our Engineering team so that they may take a look at this. I am happy to share that we are in the process of remodeling various areas around our hotel and in our guest rooms, so that we may provide better experiences. However, I again apologize that this was not finished by the time of your stay. I will also be using your breakfast experience as a coaching opportunity for our staff; we certainly want our guests to be fed well and taken care of, and this was not the case during your time with us. We do hope you think of us next time you find yourself in Green Bay, so that we may have a second chance at providing you the care, service, and product we strive to provide.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey. We appreciate feedback from all our guests as it is an opportunity to identify areas of improvement. Overall it looks like you enjoyed your stay, in exception to your dining experience. I apologize about the increase of pricing in The Pub333 and breakfast buffet, and if it has affected your overall stay. Our competitive prices with our tap beers are set in place as they only come seasonally. Our Market sells coffee and pastries in the morning or Ala Carte in breakfast if you prefer a different alternative. We try to provide different dining options  that has great quality and service, and I do apologize if it fell short within reasonable pricing. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance for future stays, and we look forward to welcoming you back to the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I sincerely apologize for both the issues you encountered as well as how they were approached. Please rest assured that we would never purposely place a guest in a room that was too loud - the employee that checked you out was new to us, and while that is no excuse, I will be using this as a coaching opportunity for our staff members. I will also be in contact with our Engineering team to investigate the noise you were hearing in your room, along with the thermostat. Again, I apologize for these issues you've encountered; for these shortcomings I have refunded you 50% of your nightly room rate. I do hope the wedding you attended was lovely, and I hope we get the chance to see you again so that we may show you the type of care, service and product we strive to provide, at any Hyatt across the globe.

If there is anything I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me.

Again, I apologize for these issues you've encountered; for these shortcomings I have refunded you 50% of your nightly room rate. I do hope the wedding you attended was lovely, and I hope we get the chance to see you again so that we may show you the type of care, service and product we strive to provide, at any Hyatt across the globe.
If there is anything I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me..

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is  our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I sincerely apologize for the issues you experienced during your stay, namely the temperature in your guest room. I appreciate you bringing this to our attention, along with the sink, so that I may share this with our Engineering team and look into this issue. Please know that we do have staff on property during most hours of the day who are available to repair these items if you believe them to be malfunctioning; our Front Desk Hosts are happy to dispatch our Engineering team so that we may make your stay more comfortable. However, I am glad to hear that the room was clean and the staff was friendly. For the ways in which we missed the mark during your stay, I'd like to extend a free breakfast to you for a future stay with us. If you do make a reservation, please reach out to me personally and I can ensure this is added to the reservation. Again, I thank you for your time and feedback, and we hope to see you again soon!

If there is anything I can do to assist you, or if you would like to set up the future stay with free breakfast, please contact me directly.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for being a Globalist with us. Your loyalty is greatly appreciated, and I apologize that we were unable to get you into an Executive suite for your stay with us. I do know that you are a frequent guest with us, and we certainly enjoy providing upgrades to our Globalists. However, this is based on availability; unfortunately during this past stay we did not have any Executive suites available to upgrade you into, so we did place you into our next best room type. I understand how this can be disappointing, and I am happy to put 5,000 World of Hyatt points into your account for the inconvenience. This is enough for a free night's stay at our property. Please allow a few business days for this to reflect in your account. I will also be sharing your positive feedback regarding Mr. Lotto with our Outlets team; Jeff truly is an asset. Again, I apologize for this oversight during your last stay, and we look forward to having the opportunity to have you as our guest in the future.

If there is anything I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for your very kind and understanding response.  And while it was not necessary to give us 5,000 WOH Points we do appreciate receiving them.
Accordingly, if it wouldn’t be too much to ask, we would like to return to Green Bay this coming week, arriving Wednesday, November 14, staying 5 nights, and depart Monday, November 19. I have gone ahead and made a Senior reservation for these dates.
Again we would appreciate upgrade to one of your Exec Suites, but will understand if this is not possible given this short notice.  Also, as Globalist I have Upgrade Awards I can use if that would help.
Thank you for staying in touch with us. We look forward to hearing back from you.

We can absolutely arrange that upgrade, however, it would be much appreciated if you would use the Upgrade Awards. Your World of Hyatt direct Globalist line can process those for you. It does appear that I have a couple Executive Suites available for your stay, so once those awards are in place I am more than happy to place you into one of them. I just have a question in choosing which suite to place you. You booked an Double Queen Standard Suite, do you prefer two Queen beds or would you prefer one King bed? I do see your preference for a high floor – unfortunately I do not have 819 available at this time, but I will place you as high up as possible. Please let me know if there are any other preferences to note when selecting your room or preparing for your arrival.
We do look forward to seeing you! If there is anything else I can do to assist you, please let me know. Otherwise I will go ahead and get your room secured and ensure the Awards are applied correctly when we see them come in from the World of Hyatt team.
Thank you so much!

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I apologize for any confusion regarding the parking fee at our hotel; we do charge $7 per night for overnight guests. We inform of this both at check-in and it is available on our website under the ""View Details"" button of the Map, Parking + Transportation section. This charge is due to limited parking in our downtown area; alternate parking for our location is the Main Street Parking Ramp, which can charge hourly at $0.75/hour at a maximum of $8.25. However, I am glad to see that you enjoyed the guest room, and we do hope to see you again. I again thank you for your time and feedback, and apologize for any miscommunication that may have occurred regarding our parking policy. 

If there is anything I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me.

2018-10-30 12:36:12] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good afternoon Mr. Martin,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I apologize for the areas in which we fell short during your stay, including check-in and the disturbances that occurred. Please know that the fire alarm situation was dealt with accordingly; a child had mistakenly pulled the alarm, setting it off. Safety and security is our number one priority for our guests, and at no time was there any danger to anyone in the hotel. I will also use the occurrence at check-in as a coaching opportunity for our staff, I understand how frustrating a situation such as that one can be, and I apologize for that. I will also waive the parking fee as a courtesy for the misunderstanding; under the ""View Details"" button of the  Map, Parking + Transportation section of our Hyatt Regency Green Bay website is where you will find mention of the $7 a night parking charge for overnight guests. Again, I apologize for the ways in which we missed the mark during your stay. We appreciate your feedback and hope to see you again soon, so that we may have a second chance to show you the product and service we strive to provide.

If there is anything I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me. 

Best wishes,

Emma Lee

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. We value feedback from our loyal World of Hyatt members as it is utilized as an opportunity for improvement. I am pleased that you had a positive impression with our rooms! I do apologize if your overall stay was less than satisfactory. I understand that our atrium noise can reflect in the rooms. Please know that we do not take noise complaints lightly and that quiet hours are in place from 9pm-6am that is enforced by our security to ensure a comfortable stay for everyone.  I have also added a preference to your profile for a quiet room, which includes a higher floor and away from the elevators for any future stays. Additionally, it looks like we fell short during the check-in process and breakfast experience. I am sorry that your family was told of no other breakfast options than the buffet. While it may have not been communicated properly by our staff, it will be used as a coaching opportunity for our colleagues so that we can accommodate those who want different dining options. We want to ensure we are providing a lasting impression from check-in, to the guest rooms, and dining area. Thank you for your feedback, as our team truly values your experience. Please let me know how I can be of further assistance for future stays.

Sincerely,

Noely San Juan

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I apologize for the lack of the Wall Street Journal in our hotel; I will certainly pass along this feedback so that we may look at bringing it into our hotel, and I will also note this on your profile so that we may be prepared for any future stays. However, I am glad to see you enjoyed our staff and your guest room. We appreciate your feedback and your loyalty as a Globalist, and look forward to seeing you again soon!

If there is anything I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me.

I appreciate you taking the time to consider this issue. Maybe you don’t need to set them out for everyone and instead make it an option for globalists.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I apologize for the areas in which we fell short during your stay. I will certainly be sharing this feedback with our Housekeeping team and also with my Front Desk staff to use as a coaching opportunity. I do see you were checked in by one of our newer staff, so I do again apologize that she was unable to tell you where the stairs are. However, I am glad to see that you enjoyed breakfast. We were delighted to have the Manufacturing First Expo staying with us, and we hope to see you again next year!

As far as breakfast is concerned, both of the milk dispensers were empty so
I wasn’t able to have cold cereal.   I would suggest more oatmeal options,
less sugary cereal and if you are going to have salmon consider not just
throwing on a plate out of the bag (dress it up a bit).  While I was eating
no one ate the cold cheese or salmon.
Seriously though, the GB Hyatt is beautiful.   I was totally surprised by
how nice and clean my room was, how nice the staff was (including servers
at breakfast) and very pleased with my room.
Thanks for asking.
Dan

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I just wanted to address your concern regarding our coolers. We do take guest safety very seriously, and as such, the coolers are labelled with that range so that we do not falsely advertise to guests any temperatures that the small units may be unable to achieve, due to the units being coolers as opposed to refrigeration units. We do have other refrigeration options available for food that may spoil, as well as medications for guests who have specific needs, in our designated refrigeration areas. Any of our Front Desk staff are able to discuss this with the appropriate parties to get items stored for guests. If there are any further concerns with a unit during future stays, we are absolutely happy to get a member of our Engineering staff up to the room to ensure the unit is functioning properly within the range noted. I appreciate you bringing this to our attention, and assure you we will strive to continue putting our guests' safety and needs above all else.

If there is anything I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I would also like to thank you for being a Discoverist with us, your loyalty is recognized and appreciated. I sincerely apologize for the issues you experienced during your stay, including parking and the bathroom facilities. Please know that we do have a dedicated Engineering team to address any malfunctions within the guest room, we certainly don't want our guests having to repair anything in the rooms. I apologize that this was not recognized before your arrival. I will share your feedback regarding our parking with the appropriate parties, and we appreciate your feedback so that we may utilize it moving forward. To go along with our apologies, I have gone ahead and deposited 5,000 World of Hyatt points into your account, enough for a free night's stay at our property or other Hyatt properties as applicable. Please allow a few business days for these to reflect in your account. Again, I thank you for your time and feedback, and we do hope to see you again soon.

Wasn't a huge deal I like your hotel a lot and travel to Green Bay frequently.  The room I booked was still very nice.  
I just thought it was weird when I was a discoverist last year I treated like royalty.  So I just found it bizarre as Globalist it was pretty hum drum.  
No biggie and I do appreciate the points.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I see that we fell short of expectations regarding the tranquility of your guest room, and I was wondering if you would be willing to provide any additional details so that we may use this as a learning tool and coaching experience. I apologize for any inconveniences you may have experienced, however, I am glad to see that you had positive interactions in other areas of our hotel. Again, I would like to thank you for your time and feedback, I look forward to hearing from you!

If there is any way I can assist you, or if you would like to provide additional details about your stay, please don't hesitate to contact me directly.

    Well, I wish I had better news for you, but no less than (3) of your employees verified that story! All separately and without knowing any others had told me this. 
   “We have this problem every fall and every spring.” “People leave because it is either too hot or too cold”! Three different employees. I’d say you have a problem. 
Sorry! 
I can only repeat what I was told.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I apologize for the issues with the temperature in your room, I understand what an impact that can have on a guest's stay. I also apologize for how the system was explained to you. Our system does work gradually to heat the guest rooms, which is why the space heater was provided, and I understand that though we try our best, we do miss the mark for some guests. Please know we appreciate your feedback and will use this as a coaching experience as well as a reference point as we move forward. We appreciate you staying with us and hope to see you again.

2018-10-16 06:13:53] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good morning Ms. Merkel,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I apologize for the inconveniences you experienced during your stay. I'm happy to share that we are currently undergoing renovations on our guest bathrooms - however, this process may take some time as we are trying not to cause issue for our in-house guests at the same time. Regarding parking, due to limited parking spaces in the downtown area and the alternative being hourly charges at the parking ramp across the street or the meters in the surrounding area, we do charge the $7 overnight fee for the lot. However, we appreciate your feedback and will certainly take this into consideration for our future. Again I would like to thank you for your time and feedback, and we hope to see you again in the future, so that you may see the product and service we strive to provide here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. 

If there is anything I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I sincerely apologize both for the fact that no one asked you about your stay upon departure, and for the issues you experienced with us during your stay. Please know as well that these issues have been addressed in their respective departments so that things like this do not occur again. I apologize on behalf of our Engineer who was not kind to you; we strive to provide genuine care to all of our guests, and how you were treated is certainly not the standard we hold ourselves to. The guest and the bartender who had an encounter have also both been addressed regarding the situation; I'm sorry for the impact this had on your daughter, I understand how upsetting a situation like that can be. Our Security is in place for the safety and protection of all guests, and that escalated scenes like that are a very, very rare occurrence on our property. I will also outreach to our Outlets department and ensure that our policies are being upheld in a fair and equal way. It is correct that we do require some sort of shoes in any of our dining areas, and it is unacceptable that your husband and another guest were treated differently regarding the same policy. I again apologize for these issues, and thank you for the time you've taken in bringing these to our attention. I do hope that if you find yourself in the area again, you think of us. I'd like to personally invite you back and see to it that you have a stay that consists of the quality and genuine care we aim to provide to all of our guests. 

If there is anything I can do for you, please feel free to contact me directly.

Hello Mr Hunter,

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. Our guest feedback is an important tool in helping us provide the best experience possible for each of our guests.  I was curious if there was anything we could do differently or better, that would have lead you to rate us a 9 or 10 overall, verses an  8?  Additionally, I noticed that you rated the ""Remembers Me and My Preferences"" section a 5. Was there anything in particular that impacted that part of your stay that we could improve upon for the future? 

I appreciate your additional time and feedback, as we are always working to improve.


Sincerely,

Lucas Boie

2018-10-11 12:25:03] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good afternoon Ms. Rukamp,

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I apologize for the areas in which we fell short during your stay. Regarding the $157, please know that you were ultimately charged only $132.83. There is a $25 incidental hold when checking in with Hyatt, that is released if nothing is charged to the room. If using a debit card to check in, it will show as a charge for some reason, but it will be released back to your account if it hasn't already. I do know some banks take longer than others, I apologize for any wait you may be experiencing. To clear up the issue with the bar, we do have the hours posted as ""11 AM - close"" and I can certainly see how this could be interpreted as traditional 2 AM bar close, but we post it this way as our Pub closes anywhere between 12 AM and 2 AM, dependent on the amount of business we are experiencing. Unfortunately that evening we did not experience business that was conducive with staying open later. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you, and that it was not explained to you that way that evening. Again, I thank you for your time and feedback, and we look forward to seeing you again in the future!

If there is anything I can do for you, please feel free to contact me directly.

Hello Mr Browne,

I appreciate your additional time and feedback, as we are always working to improve.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I sincerely apologize for the cleanliness issues you experienced during your stay. This is certainly not up to our standards, and will certainly be addressed within our Housekeeping department. Please know that this is not routine, we strive to provide genuine care to our guests, and that includes ensuring a clean, orderly environment. It is very clear that we have missed the mark during your stay. I would like to extend 5,000 World of Hyatt points to your account, enough for a free night at some Hyatt properties, including ours. I understand your hesitancy, but I would like to personally invite you back in the future so that we may show you the type of product and service we aim to provide. I am glad to personally walk the room with our Executive Housekeeper to ensure satisfaction. Please allow a few business days for these points to reflect in your account, and then our Central Reservations service can accommodate any reservations you would like to make with those points. Again, I thank you for your time and feedback and we hope to see you again. 

If there is anything else I can do for you, please don't hesitate to contact me directly. 

Best wishes,

Emma Lee

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement.

Please allow a couple of business days for these points to reflect in your account. We appreciate your loyalty as a Discoverist, and your feedback means a lot to us. I do hope your family is feeling better, I'm very sorry that they left not feeling well. Please know that your comfort is top priority to all of us here at Hyatt, and I'd like to personally invite you back sometime so that we may show you the type of product and service we strive to provide.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I apologize that some of your needs were not met during your stay. Please know that we can certainly accommodate requests for more tea - I will go ahead and make a note on your profile as well that you prefer tea over coffee so that we may prepare your room for any future arrivals. I will also pass along your feedback to our housekeeping team about both the tea and the blanket. It is certainly below standards not to replace a soiled blanket, and I extend my sincerest apologies that this was something that was overlooked. I will also pass along your feedback regarding our menus to our Culinary team. I would also like you to know that we can certainly do our best to accommodate and change on-menu items to make them vegetarian. I do understand that the menu doesn't offer a lot of variety in regards to meat-free items, but we are happy to make substitutions to meet the needs of our guests for any dietary needs or restrictions. Again, I would like to thank you for your time and feedback, and apologize for our shortcomings. We do hope to see you again soon!

If there is anything I can assist you with, or if you'd like me to make any arrangements for any future arrivals, please feel free to contact me.

2018-10-10 16:28:12] Email received from: Roberta Thompson <bobbi.thompson@att.net>: Thank you, Emma for your reply.  I appreciate you reaching out to me and addressing my survey feedback.  Please note that I enjoyed my stay at the Hyatt Green Bay very much. 
The tea issue is something that comes up at almost every hotel I visit, so I usually travel with my own supply.  I offered it only as a means to try and change the larger “world” thought pattern for those of us who do not drink coffee. Most hotels do not even offer tea or a means to simply heat water (that won’t taste like coffee) to use my own supply.  I give your Hyatt high marks for both offering it and having a machine that would provide “tasteless” hot water!
Thanks again for your reply and have a great evening!

2018-10-12 14:34:50] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good afternoon Ms. Wilson,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. We do appreciate all of your feedback regarding our product selection, including antacids and hot chocolate. I apologize that the Tums were not stocked during your stay - we do generally carry them in our Market, and I see that we fell short by not  having a continuous stock. In reference to the Pub and adding bacon, I apologize for the disappointment that occurred with this request being denied. I will address this with our Outlets department. I do know there are some of our Weekly Specials or Game Day Menu items that we generally do not alter, as our chefs like to create a certain flavor profile to delight our guests with those special entrees. However, we will use this as a coaching opportunity in the future with our staff members. I also appreciate your information regarding our third shift staff. I again apologize for the ways in which we fell short during your stay, but I thank you for your time and for the issues you have brought to our attention. We do hope to see you again, so that we may have a second chance at showing you the kind of product and service we strive to provide to all of our guests.

If there is anything I can do for you, please feel free to contact me. 

Best wishes,

Emma Lee

I usually don’t complain (sure that’s what everyone says… but no, seriously).
You made me feel better about everything and I will come back again. Probably not the same time of year though because of inconsistent air temp in rooms:).

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. I am pleased that to hear that our hotel conditions were good and had a positive check- in process. We are glad you are able to enjoy the food that was served during the conference and for breakfast as well! I sincerely apologize about the temperature control in the room and conference areas. We do provide space heaters that are available upon request for the guest rooms. Our engineering department has also made aware of these issues and have been addressed so that we can further accommodate with the colder season. We strive to provide great quality and service throughout all areas of the hotel, and it looks like we missed a mark with the room temperatures. We truly value your response as we utilize it as a coaching opportunity for future improvement. We do look forward to welcoming you back at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay and hopefully improve your stay next time. 

Sincerely,

Noely San Juan

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I sincerely apologize for the issues you dealt with during your stay with us. I am glad the Front Desk tried to help, but I do understand how an uncomfortable temperature can impact the experience. We do try our best to keep the guest rooms as comfortable as possible, but I understand that we fell short of our goal. Please know as well that we do have both fans and space heaters available if the other assistance was not sufficient. Again I apologize for the inconvenience and discomfort, I will certainly pass along your feedback to our Engineering team. We do value having you as a guest, and hope to see you again in the future.

If there is anything I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me.

1.  The out door temperature was cooler than the seasonal norm and the heat did not operate in the room.  After two unsuccessful attempts Ray, the technician who is very nice, brought in a small room heater.

2.  The toilet ran continuously and the holding tank would be triggered to fill it to the set level approximately every 55 to 70 seconds.

3.  The door entry system needs maintenance or replacement.  It would take many attempts for the card reader to open the door and in the worst cases required perhaps 50 seconds to a minute to unlock the door.  The cards were replaced by the front desk which made no improvement.

4.  A minor point, but the back side of the bathroom door needs to be varnished from the steam which likely occurred over a long period of time.

5. The water pressure is weak to barley adequate.  For example we left the Hyatt after four nights and stayed the remaining night at the Hilton in Green Bay and the water pressure in the room was terrific, just as I like it.

6. Some of the bathroom supplies and coffee supplies were not replenished as they were used.  

7. The power button on the TV in the bedroom did not operate and the set had to be turned on and off with the manual buttons located on the side of the TV set.  The other controls on the remote worked adequately.   The smaller TV set in the other half of the room works satisfactorily.

The other controls on the remote worked adequately.   The smaller TV set in the other half of the room works satisfactorily.  Compared to the TV accommodations at the Hilton where we stayed for the remained to the visit, the Hyatt fell miserably short.  Every aspect of the function of the set and all the premium channels (HBO, SHOWTIME, ETC) were available at the Hilton, but not at the Hyatt.  The menu and function of the sets were vastly superior at the Hilton.

1.  The out door temperature was cooler than the seasonal norm and the heat did not operate in the room.  After two unsuccessful attempts Ray, the technician who is very nice, brought in a small room heater.

2.  The toilet ran continuously and the holding tank would be triggered to fill it to the set level approximately every 55 to 70 seconds.

3.  The door entry system needs maintenance or replacement.  It would take many attempts for the card reader to open the door and in the worst cases required perhaps 50 seconds to a minute to unlock the door.  The cards were replaced by the front desk which made no improvement.

4.  A minor point, but the back side of the bathroom door needs to be varnished from the steam which likely occurred over a long period of time.

5. The water pressure is weak to barley adequate.  For example we left the Hyatt after four nights and stayed the remaining night at the Hilton in Green Bay and the water pressure in the room was terrific, just as I like it.

6. Some of the bathroom supplies and coffee supplies were not replenished as they were used.",Bar and food were above average and the staff was friendly.  Excellent display and arrangement of TV sets for sports minded guests to watch games.,,,Yes,Closed,"2018-10-03 23:24:48] Alert Created: Likelihood to Recommend: Likelihood to Recommend;

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I sincerely apologize for the issues that were not rectified during your stay. I'm glad to see that our Engineer, Ray, was able to get you a space heater to assist in warming your room, but I apologize that we did not address the other Engineering issues in your room during this time. I have noted your concerns, and appreciate you sharing them with us, so that we may remedy these issues. I will also certainly share your feedback with our Housekeeping team; we do expect toiletries to be replenished as needed, and I'm sorry that this was not the case during your stay with us. I have refunded $28 back to your card on file to remove parking charges for the issues you have experienced with us. Again, I thank you for your time and feedback, and we do hope to see you again.

If there is anything I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me.

I was wondering if you would be able to provide specific details about your stay or anything that we may have missed with service, food and beverage, or guest room conditions. Your response is greatly appreciated and we look forward to your feedback as it will be utilized as a coaching opportunity for improvement.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I sincerely apologize for all of the issues you experienced during your stay, especially regarding our Outlets department. I have gone ahead and refunded the Pub 333 charges I saw posted on your folio, in the amount of $16.50. You will see this back on your card in a few days. That sort of service is far below the standards we like to instill in staff members, so I'm sorry that you experienced this subpar service. I would also like to share that numerous areas of our hotel will be under renovation this season and we will continue to grow and improve as we are able. I'm sorry that these renovations were not done before your stay so that you could see the hotel in a more optimal condition; however, I understand the issues during your stay and the impact that has had. If you do think of us again, please let me know so that I may personally see to it that your stay is an enjoyable one. We hope to see you again, but regardless I thank you for your time and feedback and again apologize for your negative experience with us. 

If there is anything I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me directly.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our Guest Satisfaction Survey, as these are utilized throughout the hotel as learning opportunities for our colleagues. We strive to provide consistent quality food and service to all of our guests, and I am sorry we missed the mark during your visit. We train all of our colleagues to use a jigger when measuring drinks out to ensure consistent results for all guests and I do apologize if you felt the pricing did not match. We will be using this as a learning opportunity for our colleagues so that they may learn and grow. Please feel free to contact me if I can be of any further assistance.

Thank  you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. Your feedback is very important to us as we use it to continually learn and grow. We are in the process of replacing all of our box springs and mattresses with the new Hyatt Standard beds! I apologize that your room was cold. I see that you scored the guest room very low and said the condition was poor, I was wondering if you could elaborate on this, if there was something specific  that we could improve.  I look forward to hearing from you and hope that you will give us another try.

Good Morning Mr. Campbell,

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. Your feedback is very important to us as we use it to continually learn and grow.  You are 100% accurate that you should have had your water and coffee replenished daily. I apologize that we missed the mark with replenishing your amenities. Also, we are in the process of completing our mattress conversion to all new Hyatt standard box springs and mattresses! I hope you will give us another try and check out our new beds! We will be looking forward to your next stay.

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. I am pleased that you had a positive experience with the check-in process and our guest rooms. It looks like our food and beverage category was scored lower than the rest and I apologize if the prices were expensive. Although our competitive prices are set in place,  we strive to provide great quality and service throughout all areas of our hotel. We appreciate your feedback as it will be utilized to develop future decisions. We hope you consider the Hyatt Regency Green Bay and we look forward to welcoming you back for future accommodations.

Thank you for taking your time to fill out our Guest Satisfaction Survey, as these are utilized throughout the hotel as learning opportunities for our colleagues. We strive to provide exceptional quality food and service to all of our guests and I apologize for missing the mark during your stay. I will be using this as a coaching opportunity for our restaurant colleagues as that is not the type of service we want to be providing our guests. I hope the rest of your stay was enjoyable and please let me know if I can be of any further assistance. Thank you again for staying at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay and we look forward to welcoming you back for future visits.

Hello Mr Starch,

Thank you for staying with us again at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. We appreciate your loyalty and I'm sorry to see there were multiple issues during your stay with us this time.. We strive to provide the best experience possible and that clearly did not happen for you this time.

I will not go through each of your issues in this email but please know we have shared with the appropriate team members to make sure the physical aspects that were wrong in your room were corrected and the upgrade processes trained on.

In regards to the pox, please be assured we have no known issue with bed bugs and have not received any other communication from other guests with this concern. We appreciate you bringing the concern to our attention and have taken precautionary treatment measures through our pest control partners, just to be safe. We hope the red marks have improved, and you are well.

We would also be disappointed if this was your last impression of our hotel. I would be happy to extend an offer for a complimentary return night's stay. If you would be interested in this, please let me know and I will send you further detail.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I apologize for the inconvenience you experienced regarding your room key. I understand how technical issues such as that one can create a disappointing first impression and I'm sorry that you had to come all the way back to the front desk to reprogram the key. I appreciate you bringing this issue to our attention so that we may work with our Engineering team to ensure that this doesn't happen in the future. Again, thank you for your time and feedback, we do hope to see you again in the future.

If there is anything I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me. 

Best wishes,

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our Guest Satisfaction Survey, as we use these throughout the hotel as learning opportunities for our colleagues.  I would like to apologize for the confusion in finding your meeting room, we try to have everything clearly posted, but we missed the mark this time and I apologize for that. Noticing your food and beverage comment about dry and bland food I was wondering if it was related to conference food or if it was while dining in one of our restaurants? We strive to provide exceptional quality and service to all of our guests throughout the hotel and I am sorry we missed the mark. We will be using this as a coaching opportunity for are colleagues so that this does not occur again. Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance and we look forward to welcoming you back for future visits to the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. 

Sincerely,
Jeni

2018-10-07 06:38:59] Email received from: Darla <mdburton@charter.net>: Hi Jeni,
Sorry for the negative comments, but I believe you can’t fix it if you don’t know about it. The food was conference food at the State rate, so that might have limited the choices.
The original meeting room was marked, but the desk directed those who asked to another room, where our meeting and breakfast was actually set up-so not sure where the snafu took place. It would appear that the room changed at some point and not everyone got the memo-on both ends. 
The guest room was lovely and all the staff were pleasant and helpful! 
While I was checking out, the phone rang and the desk clerk politely put them on hold. I appreciate that while I’m standing there in person, already in process. 
Thanks for listening, 
~Darla

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and for your loyal membership with World of Hyatt. I am so happy to see that you enjoyed your overall stay, but would like to know what we can do to improve your food and beverage, as well as your guest room experience. These two categories were scored much lower than the rest, and I am hoping that you would be willing to share additional details about your stay so that we can best coach and develop our colleagues. 

If you would be willing to share additional details, please reach out to me using the contact information below, or to Jeni Linzmeyer, at jeni.linzmeyer@hyatt.com

I hope this message finds you well, and that you have a great rest of your week. Thank you again for your membership, and please consider us the next time you find yourself seeking lodging in Green Bay.

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey and being a World of Hyatt member! It looks like overall you had a positive check in process and staff interactions. I was wondering if you would be able to provide specific details that did not highlight your stay. It looks like we fell short during your dining experience and would like to hear your response about the food and service we provided. Your response is greatly appreciated and we look forward to welcoming you back at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I apologize about the inconvenience regarding the coffee pot. This issue has been addressed with our Housekeeping department as well as our Engineering department. I have also fixed the issue with the parking, you will see a refund on your card for $28.00. I apologize if the host who checked you in didn't appropriately explain the parking system. As a guest with us, you receive a ticket when pulling into our parking lot. Our Front Desk will validate that parking card so that you may get out with no charge at the gate. It is policy that the $7.00 per car per night goes on the room, and no guest should pay at the gate. Again, I apologize for the issues you experienced during your stay, and I appreciate you bringing these issues to our attention. We value you as a World of Hyatt member and hope to see you again soon.

If there is anything else I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me. 

Best wishes,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for being a Member of World of Hyatt with us. Feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I apologize about the loud door closing throughout the night; I can completely understand how this would impact your stay, and I will certainly make a note on your profile so that we can ensure you get a quiet room for any future stays. However, I am glad to see that you had positive experiences with our staff, and I appreciate your additional feedback on the rooms! Again, I apologize for the noise, but I do hope if you find yourself in the Green Bay area again, that you think of us! Thank you again for your time and feedback.

If there is anything I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me.

Best wishes,

2018-09-27 05:57:30] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good morning Mr. Mccleery,

Thank you for your feedback regarding your recent experience at our hotel. Last call is a decision that is made based on business needs and on the evening of your visit, the bar had experienced business that was not conducive with staying open until later hours. I truly apologize for the inconvenience that this caused you, and completely understand where you are coming from and the subsequent frustration. While Pub333 has standard opening hours (11 am daily), the closing time is a decision that is made by the supervisor or manager on duty based on the amount of business that is occurring. 

We truly appreciate your business, and  sincerely appreciate the time you took to give us this information, and I am glad to see that you enjoyed our guest room and had favorable staff interactions. I am happy to report that we are in the process of putting in new beds hotel wide, in addition to other modern touches like our charging stations that are found in our guest rooms, in relation to your comments about the hotel being dated. Our parking lot is also receiving updates, in addition to The Marker (across from the lobby), to commence later this year. 

I hope this message finds you well, and that you enjoy the rest of your week. I look forward to any additional details you may have. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

2018-09-26 10:57:21] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good afternoon Ms. Schommer,

First off, thank you for filling out our guest satisfaction survey, as this is one of the strongest tools we have to evaluate our operation and appropriately respond to the concerns and needs of our guests. As the Outlet's Manager, I would like to personally apologize for the Food & Beverage experience you received while staying with us. I am happy to report that we have many gluten free options, including but not limited to: bread, buns, pasta and pizza crusts. Additionally, we can tailor our creations to fit your dietary requirements, and I apologize that this was not accurately communicated to you. I am not sure if you spoke to anyone at our hotel, but if you are ever at any Hyatt Hotel & Resort, please contact the nearest associate and inform them of the items that you require/are seeking and we will promptly provide you with these types of options. If you did speak to someone and they informed you that we did not have any celiac friendly items, please respond to this message so that we can appropriately re-train/coach our colleagues; it would truly be appreciated. 

I am glad to see that our hosts welcomed you with warmth and kindness and that you enjoyed the complimentary fruit and pool area. Our Leadership Committee will certainly take into consideration your feedback regarding our signage, and we appreciate the time you took to inform us about this. Additionally, we will commend our male associate at the front desk for his welcoming presence, as well as our housekeeping team for having modern user friendly amenities such as the remote wipes in the guest rooms. 

Again, I would like to thank you for your time, Ms. Schommer and should you wish to discuss anything else, please reach out to me directly so that we can correspond. I hope you enjoy the rest of your week. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

I'm very glad to see the raving review about Stacy and Noely, I'll certainly be passing along your praise to them. However, I wanted to apologize for the issue you had at the front desk with your requests. We certainly want to accommodate all of our guests the best we can, and I do see we missed the mark on a couple of occasions. I will be putting a note on your profile about the fruit, so that we may have this prepared for future stays, as I see you stay with us regularly for the Stair Climb. We do appreciate your loyalty and your feedback; I just wanted to take the time to apologize for the mistakes that we made along the way. I will use this as a coaching opportunity, but in the meantime I'm so glad that Stacy and Noely took good care of you. I hope the Stair Climb was a wonderful time, and we hope to see you again soon!

If there is anything I can do to assist you with future stays, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I apologize for the inconvenience you experienced, primarily with the tub. I do see, however, that instead of one of our ADA rooms, you were placed in one of our Standard King Suite rooms - I apologize if a host did this in error, if you had requested an ADA room. I do still appreciate the feedback though, we do view feedback as a gift and are always looking for ways to improve our hotel. I will certainly make sure that maneuvering space in our ADA rooms is evaluated to ensure that accessibility is possible for our guests. I will also be putting in notes with our Engineering team about the bathtub in your guest room; I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Again, I appreciate your time and feedback, and I do hope that if you find yourself in the Green Bay area, you think of us. We'd love a second chance to show you the stellar service and rooms we strive to provide.

If there is anything I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me directly.

Thank you for filling out our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I apologize that we fell short of expectations, particularly in the HVAC department. Unfortunately, during this time of year, though we attempt to regulate temperatures, it can get a bit warm or too cold as the weather changes. I am sincerely sorry that this impacted your stay. If you do have a future stay with us, please know that we do offer both fans and space heaters to accommodate our guests as best we can. Thank you again for your time and feedback, we hope to see you again!

I apologize if parts of the hotel fell short of expectations; I am happy to share that we are in the process of renovating various parts of the hotel.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences you experienced during your stay, most notably with staff interactions. It is absolutely the expectation that everyone looks up and is welcoming and friendly, and I am sorry that this is not the experience you had with us. I will certainly be using this as a coaching opportunity. I do also understand the concern with the hotel roof - this is something we are in the process of working on, unfortunately due to the age of the building we do have some issues during heavy rainstorms like the one we had during your stay. I apologize if this impacted the quality of your stay with us. I do see you are a Member of World of Hyatt with us, and I am happy to deposit 2000 points into your account for these issues. These points can be used towards free nights, suite upgrades, food and beverage, and even spa treatments (at applicable properties). Again, thank you for your time and feedback; I hope if you find yourself in the Green Bay area again, you think of us. We'd love a second chance to show you the top tier service we strive to provide, and to exceed expectations.

Good morning,

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. After reviewing the billing of the three individuals it appears Paul Bartunek's room and tax was reversed off the master bill and charged to an American Express. Per the housing list room and tax was to be charged to the Air Treatment master bill.

I have forwarded your billing concerns to the event manager for the group. If you would like both your room and Thomas Shircel's room removed from the master bill please reach out to Tiffany Hamp with Air Treatment.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I sincerely apologize for the negative experiences you encountered during your stay. I will certainly share your comments about the dirty room with our housekeeping department, as this is unacceptable. I would also like you to know that, when able, we are happy to room move guests if there are such issues as a noise in the wall or some other malfunction. We do try to upkeep all of our rooms as best as we can, but I do understand that there are circumstances under which this does not happen, and we are happy to accommodate you as we are best able. I will also be crediting 5000 points to your World of Hyatt account, which is enough for a free night or suite upgrade at most Hyatt properties. Please allow for a few days for these points to reflect in your account. Thank you again for your time and feedback.

If there is anything else I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me. 

Best wishes,

I'd be glad to personally inspect any room you may stay in with us in the future, so that it better meets your needs and expectations. I am glad to see though that you did have pleasant experiences with our staff members and at breakfast! Again, thank you for your time and feedback, and we hope to see you again soon!

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I'm glad to see that despite some issues during your stay, our staff was able to respond to our shortcomings and make things right for you. I will pass along your praise to Amber and Kristin, as well as your commentary on service in our Pub to our Outlets management team. I apologize for the wait you experienced for the drinks on Friday at lunch; I do know we had a large capacity of people going through with the Ho-Chunk convention (that I see you were with, we were delighted to have the Ho-Chunk meeting held with us), but in an empty restaurant that is a disappointing experience. I also did not see a booking written in our shuttle schedule for you on Saturday, however, I did hear that our staff worked with you to get you where you needed to go, so I am glad that ultimately this issue was smoothed over. Thank you again for your feedback, and we hope to see you next year!

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for being a Discoverist with us! Your feedback is extremely valuable to us. I apologize that you had that issue with the chain in the toilet, I will certainly be having our Engineering team take a look at this. I have also credited 2000 points to your World of Hyatt account, as this is not an experience we want our guests to have. Please allow for a few days for these points to reflect in your account. However, I am so glad to see that you enjoyed the rest of your stay with us. We are delighted to have you as our guest, and hope to see you again soon!

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey. I'm glad to see that you enjoyed your time with us, we enjoyed having the Ho-Chunk group with us as well! I apologize for the issue with the folio in the email. I'm not sure what email address that is being sent to, depending on what staff member it is, a lot of our Sales staff are not here on the weekends and may not have received it yet. However, I am happy to send it to you. If you'd please send me the email address you'd like it sent to (you can reply directly to this email, or you can email my direct address listed below), and as soon as I see your response I will forward that to you. Again, thank you for your time and feedback!

If there is anything else I can do to assist you, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for being a Member of World of Hyatt with us. I sincerely apologize for all of these issues in your guest room and with our food and beverage during your stay. If you'd be willing, I'd really like to discuss your stay with you over the phone to attempt to rectify these inconveniences for you, and to get more information on a couple of them so that we may fix these issues. If you could, please contact me via the email listed below with times you'd be available to discuss. I will be out of office on September 18th-19th, but I work in the afternoons/evenings every other day this week and would love to fix these disappointing circumstances for you, as we appreciate your feedback and value you as our guest. I thank you in advance for your feedback and look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I sincerely apologize for the areas in which we fell short during your stay, namely our Food & Beverage department. I do appreciate you notifying us about the broken chair in your room, I will have our Engineering department take a look and fix that. I apologize that you had to deal with the inconvenience of a broken chair, as well. I have gone ahead and refunded one of your breakfast charges; I will also be sharing your feedback with our Outlets management team, your feedback is very valuable to us. However, on a good note, I'm so happy to hear that you had positive interactions with our staff members.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development.

We have room service lunch/dinner from 11:30 AM - 10:00 PM, as well as pizzas until midnight. There is also our Crave menu, which is 24 hour dining and includes food such as soup, oatmeal, wraps, sandwiches, yogurt, desserts, etc. Again, I apologize for the confusion, and we will use this as a coaching opportunity for our staff members. We appreciate your time and feedback.

If there is anything else I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me. We hope to see you again soon!

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. Your feedback is very important to us as we use it to continually learn and grow. I would like to apologize that you room smelled of smoke. We are a 100% smoke free property, so I can assure you that is not a normal situation or one that we take lightly. However, I am very sorry that you had to deal with the smell. I hope that you enjoyed the rest of your stay and we hope to welcome you back to Hyatt Regency Green Bay very soon.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I apologize for the ways we fell short of expectations during your stay. I do understand how uncomfortable it can be when the temperature doesn't reach the desired point; our HVAC system during this time of year struggles some with the size of the building. However, if you do stay with us again sometime, we do have space heaters and extra blankets available at your request, that we'd be happy to provide. I will also be passing along your comments regarding breakfast to our Outlets management. I apologize that you were interrupted so many times, we want our guests to feel comfortable and not rushed, and clearly that is not the experience you were provided. We also appreciate your feedback regarding signage - increased visibility is on our agenda, and your comments are valuable to us. Again, thank you for your time and feedback, and we hope to see you again, should you ever find yourself in the Green Bay area.

If there is anything I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me directly. 

Best wishes,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I sincerely apologize that we fell short of expectations during your stay; we strive to provide great service and genuine care to each of our guests, and it's clear to me that we missed the mark during your stay. We do take noise complaints seriously, and I would like to share that we are in the process of implementing a new feedback service to our guests after security is contacted and dispatched to noisy rooms, so that if it continues we are able to further investigate. I'm sorry that the noise did not stop after our officers were up to the room, and that it disrupted your stay. We will certainly use this as a learning opportunity in the future. I will also be sharing your feedback regarding the amenities with our housekeeping department, as missing bathroom amenities upon refresh is unacceptable. Regarding the pet fee, I apologize when this reservation was made with our Central Reservations agency that they did not share with you the pet fee that would be charged. I do see that our Front Office Manager, Kristin, did deduct $50 off of the pet cleaning fee to assist in that issue. If you do stay with us in the future, please feel free to contact me directly to arrange any reservations, I'd be happy to set that up for you and can more fully and confidently explain to you any and all charges and amenities at our hotel, so that there is no confusion.

If there is anything else I can do to assist you, or if you have any further reservation needs, please feel free to contact me using the information below. Thank you again for your time and feedback!

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for being a World of Hyatt Member with us. Feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and improvement. I appreciate you bringing the outside sign to our attention, we do have our Engineering department working on this issue, so that people may see our building more easily at night. Our hotel is certainly in a building that was constructed in the downtown area many years ago, it has become a staple of the area. We have been and continue to remodel to reflect our Hyatt name, however, we can only do this in bits and pieces as we do not want to inconvenience our guests. Thank you for your feedback regarding our lighting and atrium style, I will share this with our leadership committee for reflection as we continue making renovations and striving to be the best we can be. I apologize that we did not meet your expectations; I do hope if you ever find yourself in the area again that you think of Hyatt Regency Green Bay. As we continue to develop, we'd love a second chance to show you the stellar service and care we aim to provide to all of our guests. 

Again, thank you for your time and feedback; if there is anything I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me.

Please allow me to apologize for the several inconveniences you experienced recently regarding food and beverage during your stay last week. As the Outlet's Manager, I am truly sorry that we missed servicing you with excellence-on more than one occasion. Did you dine with us on both days of your stay, or just one? Additionally, do you know at about what time you arrived at The Market? We will be hosting a department meeting tomorrow, and I will be addressing the issues that you mentioned in this response. From time to time, our barista has to go away from the counter to acquire supplies, and we usually put a sign out mentioning that we will be back shortly and include that the front desk can assist during these periods. I will make sure that our Housekeeping department adds a channel guide to room 822 so that the next guest can navigate the television channels with ease. 

If you would be willing to respond to any of my above questions, it would be so appreciated. We truly want to provide world class service for all of our guests, and when mistakes are made and that bar is not reached, we want to do everything we can to further develop our team and company. I sincerely appreciate the fact that you are a World of Hyatt member, and that you took the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. I look forward to any additional comments, and hope that you have a great week. 

Kind regards,

I asked about that and was like they have food and drinks in there pointing to the bar. if I were yo come back I would not stay there. no way",meh,olf,the fruit wasn't bad the rest was fair at best. service for breakfast was terrible. i got my own coffee. they want a tip for what? seating you and clearing a dish? should just be self serve,,,,Closed,"2018-09-07 23:23:30] Alert Created: Likelihood to Recommend: Likelihood to Recommend;

Please allow me to apologize for the entirety of your stay, as that is not the experience that we would want any of our patrons to have. I am hoping that you would be willing to take a few moments to talk on the phone so that I can personally further apologize for your inconvenience, and to explain to you how much we truly care about your experience and patronage. As the Outlet's Manager and World of Hyatt Specialist at this hotel, your satisfaction is the central focus of my duties and passion. I will be in the office every day this week with the exception of Wednesday and Thursday. I would also like to look deeper into the membership program you mentioned, as from time to time contact information can change, which could alter the search results of a member's profile. If you are open to this, please respond with some convenient times that we could speak, as well as a phone number that I can reach you at. 

Again, I am truly sorry and sincerely hope to hear back from you. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I would also like to thank you for being a Member of World of Hyatt with us, your loyalty is much appreciated! I sincerely apologize for the issues regarding your check-in process. It certainly is standard procedure for us to contact a guest in the event there is an issue with the card, and it is disappointing that this did not occur. I'm sorry for the inconvenience that this caused you, as well as the alarm going off at 6 AM. We do try to take care regarding wake-up calls and billing issues, and it is very clear to me that we fell short of expectations during your stay. Again I apologize for these issues. However, I am pleased to see that you enjoyed the rest of your stay, I do hope your time in Green Bay was memorable, and that the wedding was beautiful. 

Thank you once more for your time and feedback. If there is anything else I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I do sincerely apologize for the lack of complimentary coffee in the lobby - however, we do serve fresh fruit and infused water, as well as having complimentary coffee in the guest rooms that we are happy to refill as requested. I do appreciate your feedback regarding our staff's politeness and professionalism, and I'm happy to see that we could have a proper selection of healthy options. I will, however, pass along your comments regarding pricing and the buffet-style of our breakfast to our Culinary and Outlets team. I would like to share that alternatively, we do have a la carte options that are made and served directly, as well as room service breakfast options, if either of those may better suit any future stays. Regardless, I again apologize that we fell short of expectations, and would like to personally invite you back should you ever find yourself in the Green Bay area. We'd love a second chance to show you the stellar service we strive to provide at Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

However, I do sincerely apologize for the delay in checking into your room; I understand how a later check-in can impact plans and make a not-so-great first impression.

Please allow 1-3 business days for these points to reflect in your account. Again, I apologize for the delay, however, I am certainly glad to see that you enjoyed the rest of your stay.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our best tool for identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I was the one who checked you in during your stay, and I apologize for not explaining our breakfast options more thoroughly. We do have a breakfast buffet, however, it is $12.50 per adult over 13 years of age. We do also have a la carte options down in our Atrium area where the buffet is, as well as room service breakfast. Unfortunately, Hyatt Regency properties do not include breakfast in the standard rate; however, if you stay with us in the future, we do have rates on hyatt.com that will include a breakfast package. Again, I sincerely apologize for not better explaining our breakfast options to you. However, I'm delighted to hear that you enjoyed the rest of your stay. It was a pleasure having you as our guest, and I do hope if you find yourself in the area, you think of us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

If there is anything else I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; it is feedback from guests such as yourself that is our best tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. That being said, I am sincerely sorry for the issues you experienced with some of our breakfast dishes. I will certainly be passing along your comments to our Culinary team, so that we may promptly address this. If you stay with us again, please reach out to me directly. I'd love to buy you and a guest travelling with you breakfast, so that we may have a chance to show you both our appreciation for being our guest, and to show you the service and quality we strive to provide. In addition, I'm delighted to hear that the rest of your stay was a pleasant one, I'm so glad you received everything you needed and had a comfortable room. Thank you again for your time and feedback, it is greatly appreciated.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; it is feedback from guests such as yourself that is our best tool in identifying our areas of continued growth and development. I am sincerely sorry to hear about your extremely disappointing stay. I see you are a member of World of Hyatt with us, and your loyalty is much appreciated. I would like to share that all of your concerns have been seriously noted and will be addressed by our Engineering team - we are also currently undergoing a complete replacement of all mattresses in the hotel, as well as renovations in several areas. I will also be sharing your feedback with our Housekeeping department, as inconsistency is unacceptable and this will be promptly addressed. However, I apologize that these issues so severely impacted your stay. As a gesture to go along with our sincerest apologies, I will be depositing 5,000 World of Hyatt points into your account. These points can be used for free nights, upgrades, spa treatments (where applicable), and food and beverage purchases at any Hyatt property. Please allow a few days for these points to reflect on your account. Though I do understand the frustration with all of these events, I do appreciate your commentary regarding our Front Desk staff. We hope to make improvements in all of the areas noted, and hope that if you ever find yourself in the area again, that you think of Hyatt Regency Green Bay. We'd love a second chance to show you the stellar service we strive to provide. That being said, we appreciate having you as our guest, and again, thank you for your time and feedback.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and for being a Discoverist with us. Your feedback and loyalty are very valuable to us. I sincerely apologize about the noise issue you experienced, we do try to utilize our Security team to keep the noise to a minimum, and value your commentary regarding that as we restructure our strategy. I will also certainly pass along your feedback regarding breakfast and parking charges to our leadership team, I understand that these costs can be frustrating at times. I would like to mention that if staying with us, we do have a Care Package that includes breakfast for 2, parking,  premium internet, and a $5 Food & Beverage credit (good at any of our hotel Outlets) for $25 per day during a stay, which can be a money-saver if guests intend on having breakfast every morning. However, I am glad to hear that our Front Desk staff were helpful to you, and I'm glad to see that you seem to have enjoyed the rest of your stay. Again, I apologize for the inconveniences you experienced, and I thank you for your time and feedback. We hope to see you again, should you ever find yourself in the Green Bay area!

If there is anything else I can do to assist you, or if there is anything else you would like to share about your stay, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying areas of continued growth and development. I'm sincerely sorry to hear that you were disturbed by outside noise during your stay. We do try to ensure noise is kept to a minimum, unfortunately as much as we try, I know Main Street can be quite loud at times. However, I'm glad to hear that the rest of your experiences with us were positive. We are delighted to have you as a guest, and hope that should you ever find yourself in Green Bay, that you think of us.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in our continued growth and development. I sincerely apologize for the breakfast experience you had with us. We absolutely want our guests to feel comfortable and be able to eat breakfast at their leisure, with service that exceeds expectations. We very clearly fell short of expectations during your stay, and I will be consulting with the leadership in our Outlets department so that we may rectify these issues. For the inconvenience, and as a gesture of apology, I have gone ahead and refunded your breakfast charges (totaling $16.19) back to your card on file. You should see that refund process within the next 1-4 business days. However, I am glad to hear that you had a pleasant check-in experience, I'm so happy that we were able to make that a seamless process for you. Again, I apologize for the experience you had in our breakfast area.

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself helps us identify our areas of continued growth and development. I'm sincerely sorry to hear that your room wasn't serviced until late in the day. I can completely understand your frustration regarding that, and your feedback will be shared with our Housekeeping leadership so that we may improve upon this. I also wanted to inquire if there was anything about your stay you wanted to share - I noticed in the body of the survey you rated fairly high, but the likelihood to recommend was 0. We'd love to make things right, so any commentary you're willing to share is much appreciated.

Again, thank you for your time and feedback, and if there is anything else I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; it is feedback from guests such as yourself that helps us identify our areas of growth and improvement. That being said, I am so sincerely sorry regarding your negative experiences at check-in and at our Pub 333. I have gone ahead and refunded $40.00 to the card on file for the subpar dinner. I will certainly be sharing your feedback with our Outlets leadership, and I apologize for the lackluster food you had that evening. I will also be using your check-in experience as a coaching tool for our team. We are always looking for ways to improve our guest experiences, so I will be certain to address this with our Front Desk Agents.
Again, I sincerely thank you for your time and feedback, and we do hope that should you find yourself in the Green Bay area, you think of us. We'd love to show you the stellar service we strive to provide at Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

If there is anything I can do to assist you further, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; it is feedback from guests such as yourself that help us identify our areas of growth and improvement. I apologize that we fell short of expectations during your stay. I am however, happy to share with you that we are in the process of rejuvenating our guest rooms to improve the comfort and experiences of our guests. We do also have replacements for the equipment in the rooms; I apologize that your blowdryer wasn't replaced. If in the future this is an issue that is encountered, please feel free to contact our front desk (ext. 0 from the guest rooms), and we'll gladly get a replacement up to you quickly. Our primary objective is to make every stay a comfortable and memorable one with genuine care from our staff. I plan to share your feedback so that the different areas of our hotel can learn from these experiences. If you ever find yourself in the Green Bay area again, I do hope you think of us so that we may show you the type of service we strive to provide to each and every guest.

If there is anything else I can do to assist you, please don't hesitate to contact me. 

Best wishes,

First, my room was not ready when I arrived around 4:45pm. I was informed by the desk clerk that a lot of the rooms were not clean. The clerk could not give me a time frame on when my room would be ready, which was quite an i conviene because i was going to the football game that evening.

When I finally returned to the hotel after the game at 11pm, I received my key to my room and again asked the clerk (now a young man) if my room was indeed the corner king, to which he responded yes.

Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay and for choosing to continuously stay with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay.  I would like to apologize for not having the open-concept studio suite available when you returned from the game and for the delay upon arrival prior to the game.  I was the one assigning rooms while people waited.  I did not know about specifics of your room type booking and upgraded you to a custom king suite.  I have updated your profile with your need for a studio king suite.  I hope this experience does not deter you from returning when you come to enjoy Green Bay and Lambeau Field.  Please feel free to contact me should you need any future assistance so I may prepare for your arrival appropriately.  Thank you again for staying with us and I hope you have a wonderful weekend!

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; it is feedback from guests such as yourself that helps us identify our areas of growth and development. That being said, I apologize for the ways we fell short during your stay. Our primary objective at Hyatt is to extend genuine care to our guests, to make their stay as comfortable and memorable as possible. I apologize sincerely that our staff at the Front Desk didn't appropriately convey that care to you, as we truly do appreciate you as our guest. Regarding our guest rooms, I'm happy to share that in addition to the new mattresses (which I'm glad to see that you enjoyed!), we are also providing some TLC to many different areas of our suites, to rejuvenate them and improve our guest experience. Our coolers are labeled as such primarily because, though we can attempt to adjust them to go colder than 45 degrees, we did not want to mislead guests and have any important foods or medications become spoiled. We do have other storage options for our guests outside of the room's coolers if you do have items that require a colder temperature, any of our Front Desk Agents are happy to store something for a guest in one of our facility's refrigerators. Again, I am sincerely sorry that we fell short of expectations during your stay with us. I plan to use your feedback as coaching opportunities for all of our staff members, and we do hope you think of us if you find yourself in Green Bay again, so that we may truly show you the kind of service we strive to give at Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

If there is anything else I can do to assist you, please don't hesitate to contact me. 

Best wishes,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey. I am sincerely sorry to hear about your negative experience with us regarding parking. I completely understand the frustration with the ticket validation. We do try to make the process as smooth as possible for our guests, but I know that it can at times still be an ordeal.  also very much appreciate your feedback regarding our overflow parking - I would like to share that our leadership is working on an improved system for guiding our guests to overflow parking when necessary, and that we are happy to extend assistance in any way possible, including staff escorts for any safety concerns as well as assisting with luggage. Our primary goal is to make things as comfortable as possible for our guests with genuine care, and I apologize that we fell short during your stay.

Thank you so much for all of the kind comments about the hotel staff, and your loyal membership with World of Hyatt. I am so glad to see that we met you with a positive and helping attitude. As the Outlets manager, I am especially happy to read that the Starbucks service and bartenders were great. I have already spoken to our Event Services Manager and she will be reviewing the information that you provided us with regarding the wedding staff and their behavior. We wouldn't be able to grow and improve without your feedback, so please accept my genuine appreciation for your time in sharing it with us. I am also glad to see that our lobby games were a nice treat with your family. We are always looking for new ways to improve the guest experience, and I am glad to see that this feature is going over well. 

Thank you again for your time and loyalty, Mr. Anklam. Please enjoy the rest of your weekend. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of growth and improvement. I am so sincerely sorry to hear about your negative experiences with our rooms. We certainly strive for better cleanliness than that, and I assure you that your comments will be passed along to our Housekeeping management so they are aware of this. However, I am happy to hear that our staff was helpful to you with any issues that did arise. I will also pass along your comments regarding the bacon mac and cheese, I'm sure our culinary team will greatly appreciate your feedback.

Check-in: My room was not ready for quite some time because some kind of large group was taking a long time to check out, so I had to change my clothes and do my makeup in the public restroom in order to get ready for my conference that afternoon.

This is an unacceptable oversight.
Tranquility: The doors/windows in the front of the room were so not sound-proof that early every morning, I could hear the clinking of dishes in the restaurant several floors below.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, feedback from guests such as yourself is our best tool in identifying our areas of growth and improvement. I am so sincerely sorry and disappointed to hear about your negative experience regarding our staff explanation of the shuttle. I will certainly be using this as a coaching opportunity with our staff; we do not require tons of advance notice, though the earlier a guest can notify us, the more likely we will be able to accommodate. So I agree, certainly you should have been notified of shuttle policy upon check-in. I also apologize that there wasn't more effort put into arranging your transportation once you were in that situation - we strive to provide genuine care, and we very clearly missed the mark during your stay. I notice you were with the Writer's Police Academy, a group we hope to continue having in the coming years. I'd like to personally invite you to stay with us again should the convention be here next year, and I would like to personally arrange your shuttle transportation to and from the airport. We'd love the opportunity to show you the service we are truly capable of, the service that all of our guests deserve. Again, I very much apologize for this large oversight during your stay, and I urge you to contact me if there is any other way I can be of assistance. 

Thank you again for your time and feedback, I appreciate you bringing this to our attention, as this is a significant learning experience for our staff members. 

Best wishes,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; it is feedback from guests such as yourself that is our best tool for identifying our areas of growth and improvement. I do completely understand the frustration with the delayed check-in time, and we certainly appreciate everyone's patience that day. I do also apologize for the delay, despite our best efforts, I'm aware that an experience like the one you had can still have a largely negative impact. I'm glad that you were provided a complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience, and I'm even happier to hear that you enjoyed it. Again, I thank you for your time and feedback, and we do hope that if you ever find yourself in the area, that you think of us. We'd love to show you the excellent service we are truly capable of, to make your stay one to remember!

If there is anything else I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our survey and provide us with feedback about your stay. While I glad to see you enjoyed the majority of your stay, I noticed you rated your overall food and beverage considerably lower than the rest of your ratings, and was wondering if there was anything specific that you felt was not up to your expectations that you would like to share. We will use any information you provide as a learning experience, and hope to be able surpass your expectations if we have the opportunity to serve you again. If you have any concerns or comments please feel free to contact me at the email below.
Thank you.

It was obvious that the hotel was an older building, but everything was very well maintained and anything I asked for, I received very quickly, so thank you. 

However, that being said, I have a couple of issues. 
1) When you offer a conference room rate for a stated price, it is unfair to raise that rate for that block of rooms because of some event that is occurring elsewhere in town. I was offered a rate of $149, which was a great rate, but then on Thursday night I had to pay $229 because of the football game, which I was not interested in, nor could I have attended, even if I wanted to, because of the conference activities. I was very irritated at having to pay more for Thursday night when it was intuitively obvious that I was NOT there for that game or any other event, except for my conference. So next time I come for a conference, maybe I will stay next door at the Hampton Inn.

2) You REALLY need to upgrade your elevators. They run slower than molasses in January. I cannot express how frustrated I got several times waiting for an elevator. And you may think I could just use the stairs, but that is not so. I have arthritis in both knees and was on the 6th floor. This is a big issue for me and something that makes it less likely that I will stay at your hotel next time.; ;I do not recall that the fact I was a World of Hyatt member was ever mentioned during my stay, so I cannot respond to this question with any certainty.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","I stayed four nights at your hotel for a conference.

The bed was very comfortable, but for me it was just too high to get into without pain, due to arthritis in my knees. Those pillow top mattresses are great, except for the fact that they sit so high it was quite difficult for me to get into bed. 

This may sound weird, but the toilet seat sat way too low for me to comfortably use it. When I did, it was very painful to get up and down. Consequently, I tried my best to use the facilities on the main floor, where I could access a handicapped stall, as much as possible. That was not the best situation.","I had dinner one night at Pub 333 and it was very good, and prices were reasonable. The service was good also. 

Buffet breakfast during my conference was satisfactory: nothing to brag about but it was fine.

Thank you for your patronage, and for spending the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. I am glad to see that you were pleased with the condition of our hotel, however, I noticed that we fell short from a positive experience in the rest of our categories. 

Would you be willing to share any details about the rest of your stay so that we can learn how to better serve you? I am a firm believer that current guest feedback is our biggest tool to growth and development, as we continue to seek the deliverance of world class service here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am most dis-heartened, in particular, to see that we only garnered a 5 in the staff sincerely cared field. Were there particular departments/interactions that you had with our colleagues that were not met with sincerity and genuine service? 

Any information you would be willing to share would be absolutely appreciated. My contact information can be found in the signature below. Thank you again for your time, Ms. Omland; please enjoy the rest of your weekend. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey; it is feedback from guests such as yourself that is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of growth and improvement. That being said, I am incredibly sorry to hear about your disappointing experience in our Pub 333. I've shared your comments with our Outlets management, and we fully intend to use this as a coaching opportunity for our staff so that we may provide the optimal service that we strive for. I would also like to apologize for your interaction with one of our Front Desk Agents on Saturday. It is true, we do not have a shipping department; however, when available, we are able to a) provide shuttle service to the nearest shipping service, as time permits or b) can contact said shipping services and assist the guest in arranging a pick-up from the hotel for the item. Truly, I am sorry that our Agent did not go above and beyond to attempt to help you ship your item - that is not the service we aim to provide, and I understand how experiences such as these can have an impact on a guest's stay. I'd like to personally welcome you back to the Hyatt Regency Green Bay, so that we may show you the customer service we are truly capable of, should you ever find yourself in the area.

If there is anything else I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me. 

Best wishes,

Emma Lee

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. Thank you for the positive comments about our staff and bar service! It looks like we fell short with your dining experience and I apologize if the meals did not taste good. I was wondering if you could provide any specific details as to what your order was from The Market or Pub333? We want to ensure that we are meeting guests' needs and expectations when it comes to quality and service throughout the hotel. Additionally, were there specific products or meals you were looking for? Downtown Green Bay also offers different dining options if you prefer a variety. We'd be happy to give you any suggestions should you make plans returning to Green Bay. Please know that our team will utilize your feedback when making considerations for future plans. Your response is greatly appreciated!

I had a sandwich from The Market. It was okay.
 
Again, the wait staff was very nice each visit.

Good evening Ms. Heiter,

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our survey and provide us with feedback about your stay. While I am glad you were able to order off the menu and get your vegetarian meal, we will look into expanding our limited game day menu to include more vegetarian options. We try to provide a varied menu for guests with variety of diets, unfortunately we seem to have fallen short of your expectations.  Hopefully, if we have the opportunity to serve you again, we will be able to fulfill your expectations.  If you have any other concerns or comments please feel free to contact me at the email below.
Thank you.

Thank you for your new membership and patronage as a World of Hyatt member; we appreciate you taking the time to fill out this detailed guest satisfaction survey. As the Outlet's Manager, I would like to sincerely apologize for the issues that you experienced in Pub333 during your stay with us. We truly enjoyed having your group here for its first year at Hyatt Regency Green Bay, and have had several discussions, both within our organization, as well as with other guests that attended your conference regarding the less that satisfactory experience that occurred when we were not adequately staffed. I can personally assure you that the next time your group stays with us, we will be well prepared to fully service your group at any time of the day or night. 

I am glad to see that the Front Desk provided you with understanding and customer service after the situation with your privacy sign being ignored in combination with your late check-out. We will be sure to make this a pre-shift topic and guarantee that we have full understanding in our daily meetings so that further guests are not inconvenienced by this oversight. 

It appears as though there were some charges on your folio from a purchase at The Market, in the lobby across from the Front Desk. I worked in cooperation with the Front Office leadership to have those charges removed, and you should now see a refund placed on your Visa in the amount of $20.54. 

I sincerely hope that you decide to stay with Hyatt Hotels & Resorts again soon, and to join us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. We truly do have a fantastic team that is dedicated to providing world class service, and while we missed the mark during your recent stay, I assure you that we can show you what an exceptional hotel experience looks like. If you find yourself lodging in Green Bay in the future, please reach out to me personally so that I can assist in creating an above and beyond experience for you; my contact information can be found in the signature below. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

2018-08-18 18:57:49] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good evening Ms. Walton,

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our best tool in identifying areas of growth within our hotel and staff. First of all, I am sincerely sorry that we fell short of expectations during your stay. I completely agree, our staff should have brought your lost luggage up to your room immediately, and I will certainly be using this as a coaching opportunity for our Front Desk Agents. I am, however, happy to hear that Kolton made such a positive impact. He truly is an asset to our team, and I'm glad that your interaction with him was pleasant. I also appreciate your feedback on our Food and Beverage departments, I will promptly pass along your comments so that our culinary team and Outlets management can address these issues. Again, I do apologize for the inconveniences and lack of care you experienced during your stay. We aim to make every guest feel as comfortable and cared for as possible, and we missed the mark during your stay. I do hope if you ever find yourself in the Green Bay area again, you think of us. I'd be happy to personally welcome you back and extend a complimentary meal in Pub 333 as a token of our gratitude to you for being our guest.

If there is anything else I can assist you with, or if you do find yourself in the area, please don't hesitate to contact me. 

Best wishes,

Emma Lee

Good evening Ms. Van Heugten,

	Thank you for taking the time to fill out our survey and provide us with feedback about your stay.  I want to apologize for the unfortunate lack of quality in your food. I just want to take time to say that we always use fresh ingredients and strive to make the best food we possibly can.  That being said, we obviously missed the mark with your meal, most notably your hummus. We will use this as a learning experience and hope to be able to surpass your expectations if we have the opportunity to serve you again. If you have any other concerns or comments please contact me at the email below.
Thank you

Sincerely,

However, it looks like you rated a 6 for the overall food & beverage experience. I was wondering if you could provide any additional details from your dining service or overall stay?

I appreciate you taking the time to fill out a detailed survey following your stay this past weekend, and am so glad to read that it was an overall excellent experience. We certainly enjoyed having your group here for it's first time at our venue, and I am glad to see that you were able to do so as a World of Hyatt member; thank you for your loyalty. 

I take full responsibility for the experience that you had in Pub333. As the Outlet Manager at the hotel, I do know that on Friday afternoon we were extremely busy, and could have done a better job with coverage than what was allotted, a situation which affected you as well as other guests. I would never want any table to wait over an hour for anything, beverage service included. To see that the operation I am in charge of and the word ""awful"" is in the same sentence is certainly a wake up call for me, and I sincerely apologize that you were not met with better service, or an apology in that moment for that matter. I care deeply about the experience our patrons receive, both from the perspective of customer service in general, as well as the Hyatt experience that has come to be my home for many years of my career. 

I am glad to see that you were able to receive some good selections from The Market across from the lobby. I am sincerely sorry that you received the experience you did, and promise you that the next time your group is in house, we will be adequately covered in our lobby restaurant. I hope that you do not let your experience here change your opinion of Hyatt. I assure you that there are people here that care a lot about all of our guests, and I hope that you give us another opportunity in the future to show you this firsthand. I would be happy to talk with you in detail about any parts of your time in our Outlets, and if you are interested in doing so, please simply respond to the email address listed in my signature below and we can set up a time to discuss on the phone. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

2018-08-14 22:21:01] Email received from: Lee Goldberg <lee@leegoldberg.com>: The problem in the restaurant wasn't just on Friday afternoon when you were
extremely busy. We also encountered it on Thursday at lunch and in the late
afternoon on Sunday. It was especially frustrating on Sunday when we were
one of two parties in the restaurant -- and it STILL took an hour to get
our food. I am sure I am not the only patron who complained about this.

	Thank you for taking the time to fill out our survey and provide us with feedback about your stay.  I want to apologize for the unfortunate lack of quality in your food. I just want to take time to say that we always try to provide food to be served at a proper temperature.   That being said, we obviously missed the mark with your meal, most notably your dessert. I would also like to follow up and assure that the problem with your dressing in the market has been corrected immediately.  Also, while I’m glad that the charge from the pub was resolved at checkout it is unfortunate that that it was an issue at all.  We will use this as a learning experience and hope to be able to surpass your expectations if we have the opportunity to serve you again. If you have any other concerns or comments please contact me at the email below.
Thank you

Sincerely,

Thank you for being a World of Hyatt member and taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. I am pleased that you had a positive interaction with our helpful and friendly staff and it looks like overall you were satisfied with your stay. I apologize about your check in process and for any confusion you may have encountered. I was wondering if you could provide any specific details as to anything we may have missed when you checked in. Additionally, it looks like we fell short during your dining experience. Although we are glad you enjoyed the food, I apologize if our service left you with an undesirable impression about our restaurant.  Please know that your feedback will be utilized as a learning and coaching opportunity for our property. We strive to provide great quality and service throughout the hotel and we look forward to welcoming you back in the future.

Thank you for your loyal membership with World of Hyatt. We appreciate your patronage, as well as the time you dedicated to filling out our guest satisfaction survey. I remember speaking with you and your wife in our atrium, and I cannot thank you enough for your patience while we were in the process of preparing your guest room. I absolutely understand the frustration that would ensue from anyone not receiving the timeliness or experience they expected, and I assure you that this is not something that happens frequently at our property. Above all, our goal is to make sure that we care for our guests and deliver world class service. We fell short on Thursday, and I hope that you will not let this affect your view of Hyatt Hotels & Resorts. We are spending time dedicated to learning how we can prevent a situation like this in the future, to make sure that arriving guests don't undergo what you and your wife did, as both a leadership team and overall operation. 

If you would like to discuss any further details from this past Thursday, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email.

Kind regards,
Matthew

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest survey following your stay at our hotel. I am glad to see that you were pleased with how our staff handled last Thursday, and we are fortunate to have such a great group of people working at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I completely understand why anyone would be upset with not being able to check in to their hotel room on time, especially when they have plans to be somewhere important at a certain time. I am glad to see that Kristin, our Front Office Manager took great care in offering the complimentary breakfast that she did to your family, and I hope that you had a good experience at our buffet on Friday morning. 

To compensate you for lost time, I have refunded $30 plus tax to the Visa card that you have on file. Please look for this reversal on your billing statements. We are thankful that you stayed with us, and hope that you look to us again the next time you seek lodging in Green Bay.

2018-08-12 19:01:13] Email received from: Justin Wurtzel <justinmwurtzel@gmail.com>: I had a 3 pm check-in set by Hyatt and received an offer to upgrade it to
noon for a small fee which I accepted. Upon arrival with my grandparents, I
was told we couldn't get into our room because the hotel was busy with a
conference. They couldn't guarantee my 3 pm check-in time.
This was a trip for us to take my grandparents to the football game so we
had a set schedule to get everything done we wanted to do and I had no
interest in rescheduling everything to accommodate Hyatt because they were
disorganized/overbooked themselves. I understand businesses are busy on
game day but do not be *rude* when I accept and pay for an upgrade offered
to me ahead of time.

The hotel appears to have been recently remodeled and is in a very good location. The staff is very nice and helpful as well.,ALL were very friendly and helpful.,"My wife is handicapped and we requested an accessible room. We were given one that you had to make a 90 degree turn to enter the room - she COULD NOT do it alone and the shower had one grab bar on the back wall with a hand-held shower head that was not able to turn but just move up and down on the bar. In our opinion, that shower did not meet ADA requirements and the 4 days we were there she only had enough strength to take 1 shower and wash her hair - with great difficulty. The counter for the sink was tiny and nothing could really be placed there except exactly what was in use at the time. The carpet was thick (and very clean!) but very difficult for her to roll her wheelchair on. The sofa/reclining area was microfiber fabric - she could not transfer to relax there because she could not slide on it. We realize the hotel was probably built before the ADA compliance instructions came out but.....the shower definitely needs additional grab bars for safety factors. She almost fell twice during the one shower she took. I was in there with her to keep that from happening. In addition, the mattress on the higher bed was very soft and we both came home with back aches and spasms. BUT the room was very clean and large enough to get around in the wheelchair - it's just hard to get in and out of because of the hallway and turn.",The Pub was super for lunch the one day we were needing lunch while at the hotel. The breakfast buffet is excellent with many healthy choices. We were very pleased with the meals at the hotel.,,,,Closed,"2018-08-10 12:45:32] Alert Created: Alert 4 Guest Room <=6: Guest Room <=6;

Thank you so much for responding to our guest satisfaction survey. Feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying our growth areas. I very much appreciate your praise about the hotel lobby, location, food & beverage, and about our staff. I'll be certain to pass it along to the appropriate parties. But more importantly, I greatly appreciate and value your feedback about our ADA suite - there is always room for improvement, and you've given us some wonderful insight into how to go about that. However, I sincerely apologize for the trouble you and your wife went through in regards to the improvements that need to be made. I will say we do have all of our mattresses being replaced this summer, which will alleviate the too-soft issue. I do hope you and your wife are feeling better in regards to the back spasms, I'm very saddened to hear that you were caused discomfort during your stay. We sincerely appreciate you choosing the Hyatt Regency Green Bay, and I hope you think of us if you find yourself in the area again! 

If there is anything I can do to assist you further, please don't hesitate to contact me directly. 

Best wishes,

Thank you for the detailed feedback that you have provided us with. We enjoy hosting the annual convention that you attended, and appreciate your membership with World of Hyatt. We have been discussing what we can do in regards to our elevators to improve the guest experience in our Operational meetings and will be sure to add your comments to this process. I am so glad to hear that you enjoy our staff and rest assured, Dawn will be commended; we are fortunate to have fantastic colleagues like her on staff.  

We do our utmost to provide competitive pricing in Pub333 that is comparable to venues of the same scale within the local market as well as the Hyatt Regency brand, so I do apologize that this negatively affected your experience. As we do detailed documenting of all of our conventions, I will be sure to add these comments to that, so that we could consider alternative and featured offerings during your next convention. 

If you have anything else that you would like to mention so that we can use it towards improving the guest experience, please reach out to me using the contact information listed below. Thank you again for your feedback, and please enjoy the rest of your weekend. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey. I am sorely disappointed to hear that your interactions with our Front Office staff were not up to par with our standards here. Our goal is certainly to offer genuine care and respect, and I apologize that you did not receive that treatment upon arrival and departure. I am however, delighted to hear that you had wonderful experiences with our Outlets staff, I'll be sure to pass along the praise, as well as use your feedback as a coaching opportunity for my own staff. Feedback from guests such as yourself is our best tool for growth and learning, and I very much appreciate it. I hope that if you ever find yourself in Green Bay again, you think of us, so that we may show you how we truly would like to engage our guests here at the Hyatt Regency.

If there is anything else I can do to assist you, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Best wishes,

Emma Lee

2018-08-15 20:24:23] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good evening Mr. Graf,

First of all I'd like to thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey; feedback from guests such as yourself is our best tool in identifying areas of growth. In addition, I'd like to sincerely and profusely apologize for the lack of care you were shown during your time with us. I also apologize that management was not brought into the situation; we do want our staff members to feel empowered, but I understand how frustrating it can be when a problem isn't solved and there doesn't seem to be anyone to speak with. Please know that that issue has been addressed, and I appreciate you bringing this to light for us. I did also pass along your comments regarding the phone to our Engineering team - you are correct, that should have been solved during your stay and though I don't understand why it was not, I assure you that is not the level of service we aim for and I am sorely disappointed that we fell short of expectations. I've also looked into the issue with the breakfast gratuity, and I've realized what happened. It appears on your receipts, you did include your cash tip on the tip line, which is completely understandable. I believe the servers misunderstood, as the tip line is generally used for tips going on the room/card, and therefore charged that tip in addition to the cash tip. I do see that those gratuity amounts were refunded on 08-05. I'm happy to extend 2,000 World of Hyatt points - these points are as good as cash, and can be used for room upgrades, food, beverages, spa treatments (at applicable properties) at any of our Hyatt properties. Please allow 2-3 business days for these to be deposited into your World of Hyatt account. I again sincerely apologize for the issues you endured during your stay, and I appreciate you reaching out to us to bring this to our attention. I'd like to personally welcome you back to Hyatt Regency Green Bay if you should ever find yourself in the area again, we would truly like the opportunity to show you the level of care and service we aim to provide.

If there is anything else I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. I am pleased to see that you had a positive experience with our staff and guest rooms. I apologize about the draft beers not working on Friday night. We unfortunately had a minor malfunction in our beer lines. Our Engineering department did repair it within the hour and rest assured continued normally. I apologize if we fell short during your bar service, please let me know if there's anything we can better accommodate for future stays. Please know that your feedback is greatly appreciated and will be taken into consideration as we move forward.

I would like to thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay.  It is so nice to hear that you enjoyed the staff, but your comment about a manager acting in such a manner is very concerning to me.  Would you be willing to explain in more detail the situation where a manager behaved poorly.  Our main focus is service and the heart of our purpose is caring for people.  We appreciate all opportunities to better our service and I would like to be able to follow up on your experience.  I would also like to thank you for mentioning the attention needed in the room.  These concerns have been passed on to our maintenance department.  I appreciate your comments and look forward to hearing from you!

First and foremost I'd like to thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and for being a member of World of Hyatt with us. We do certainly appreciate your loyalty to both the Hyatt brand and our specific hotel, and I apologize that upon check-in you were not recognized as a repeat guest of ours. This is certainly a learning opportunity I will use to coach our front desk agents, so that guests such as yourself are made aware how valuable you are to us. I would like to explain that one of the biggest perks of being a World of Hyatt member is the points earned with each stay. With every qualifying rate booked, you earn 5 points per every US dollar, which can go towards things like food & beverage, spa treatments (where offered), and free nights at our properties. There is also recognition - which unfortunately was not achieved during your stay, but is something we look forward to offering during your next visit. I will also pass along your feedback regarding the breakfast service to our Outlets management team, so that we may do what is necessary to ensure a positive experience. 

Again I thank you for your time and feedback. If there is anything else I can do to assist you, please don't hesitate to contact me. 

Best wishes,

I would like to apologize again for the frustrations and inconvenience you experienced when you arrived at our hotel.  I have already responded to your refund inquiry directly through booking.com but wanted to reassure you that the credit is being processed.  We have refunded the deposit for your entire stay.  Your bank may take 3-5 business days to process the refund but you should see if reflected on your account within the current week.  Please let me know if it does not appear and I will be more than happy to contact them.  Feel free to contact me directly should you need any future assistance to ensure you are well taken care of.

First I'd like to thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and for being a member of World of Hyatt with us. Your feedback is valuable to us, which is why I'm extremely disappointed to hear that you had a stay that didn't come near our standards in customer service and quality. I'd like you to know that the issues you highlighted with one of our colleagues have been addressed accordingly, and that we never want any of our guests to be treated with anything less than sincere care and respect. I also appreciate your feedback on our rooms, and I am delighted to share that our hotel is undergoing a number of renovations, including new mattresses and complete revamps of different areas in the hotel. We are constantly striving to improve the guest experience and make everyone's stay as comfortable as possible. I understand the impact that a poor experience can have, however, if you should ever find yourself in need of a place to stay, I'd like to invite you back to the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I'm happy to personally inspect the cleanliness and quality of your room prior to arrival (though we expect all of our rooms are up to the highest standards), and to meet any other needs or wants you may have.

If there is anything else I can assist you with, please don't hesitate to contact me.

2018-08-03 13:29:52] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good afternoon Ms. Solis,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey. Feedback from guests such as yourself is important to us as we strive to learn and grow.
I was the one you ultimately spoke with at the front desk, after attempting to get more information from our Engineering department. I'm sorry if we didn't come across as helpful about the situation, I was genuinely concerned about the sense of security for you and your guests. Our first priority at Hyatt Regency is the safety and security of our guests, and I thought I made an earnest attempt to meet your expectations, so again I apologize if you feel we didn't meet that. I would like to let you know that I brought this incident to the appropriate departments and it did spark a review and restructure of policies should a situation like this arise in the future. If you would like to provide more information about the commentary our Engineering team made that made you uncomfortable, I'd be happy to communicate your concerns to our Engineering management. I'm glad to hear that the rest of your stay was pleasant and that you enjoyed the food in our establishment.

If there is anything else I can assist you with, please feel free to contact me.

Best wishes,

I truly want to thank you for providing us with this feedback, especially after a frustrating one night stay like you had. Our elite members are extremely important to us, and I am terribly sorry that you were not provided with better recovery during the situation you experienced on Tuesday morning. I have already reviewed this circumstance with our staff, so that if something like this were to happen ever again, we would be able to more appropriately and efficiently able to respond, whether that is a late breakfast coming out, or creamer being forgotten, or the approach with which service recovery is taken. Our Front Office Manager, Kristin, has assured me that the 1,000 points she spoke with you about over the phone has been credited to your account, and breakfast has been taken care of by the hotel.

I am so glad to see that you stay here regularly, and I hope that this isolated incident does not completely tarnish your opinion of our establishment. I and the colleagues on the Hyatt team are committed to making your stay here an excellent experience, and I hope that you will allow us to provide you with this once more. Please feel free to contact me using the information below if you would like to discuss the events of this week more in depth. Thank you again for all of your comments, Mr. Wasson, and please enjoy the rest of your week. 


Sincerely,

Merci beaucoup d'avoir pris le temps de répondre à notre sondage sur la satisfaction des clients. Votre réponse signifie beaucoup pour nous. Je suis désolé pour votre expérience désagréable, je parlerai avec nos FO employés et housekeeping. Vous avez absolument raison, vous ne devriez pas avoir à demander du shampoing et du savon pour le corps, et je suis désolé que vous ayez dû supporter cette insatisfaction. Je vou te donner 2,000 World of Hyatt points pour votre expérience. Je veux aussi te remercier d'être membre de World of Hyatt.

That is not correct as the breakfast was included in the rate of the room and you should have not done that
I hope you will quickly correct that mistake and credit my amex account of that amount.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. It is feedback from guests such as yourself that is our best tool for growth and improvement. I'm glad to hear that your experiences with our staff as well as our food & beverage outlets were positive ones, however I'm very sorry to hear that your room was not at a temperature that was comfortable for you. I completely understand how a room that is too cold or too hot can very much impact a guest's stay. Due to the older nature of the building, we do our best to regulate temperature with the system installed, but I know that does not always solve the issue. We do have space heaters and extra blankets, as well as fans if the room were to ever become too hot, available to our guests 24/7. I again sincerely apologize if this was not offered to you during your time with us. If you ever find yourself in Green Bay again, we hope you think of us, and I'm happy to personally see to any accommodations you may need so that your room is comfortable.

If there is anything else I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me. 

Best wishes,

Emma Lee

Good Evening Mr. Ramsey, 

Thank you for completing our guest satisfaction survey, and thank you for your loyalty to the Hyatt brand.

I hope you did enjoy your stay, and we hope to welcome you back in the future.

Yes, we did enjoy our stay, the customer service was excellent and even the hotel was acceptable. I was just trying to give you some honest feedback that the property is not what I have come to expect from a Hyatt Regency.

Thank you for responding to our guest satisfaction survey. Feedback from guests such as yourself is our best tool in identifying areas of growth and learning. I apologize that the charge on your bill was not adequately explained. It appears it was our '333 Care Package', which includes breakfast in our Atrium for 2 adults, a $5.00 food & beverage credit for any of our outlets, complimentary parking, and complimentary premium internet. It is available daily and can be added anytime before check-out. For the inconvenience and miscommunication I sincerely apologize, I've removed the $25 + tax charge from your bill. You should see this refund process within 3-5 business days. I'm also disappointed to hear that your room was not properly refreshed during your stay; I will certainly communicate these concerns with our housekeeping department so that we may improve upon this in the future. However, I am happy to hear that your experience with one of our Front Office staff members as well as our food & beverage outlets was pleasant. 

Again I thank you for your feedback, and should you find yourself back in Green Bay, I hope you think of us. We'd love to welcome you back.

Hello Ms Cornelius,

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. We are pleased to see you enjoyed your overall stay! I see there were a couple categories you marked slightly lower and was wondering if there were any specific details from your experience that we could improve upon for next time? Any further feedback is always appreciated. 

Thank you in advance for your time.

First of all I'd like to thank you for responding to our guest satisfaction survey, and for being a Discoverist with us. Your loyalty is extremely valuable to us, and as such I'm horribly disappointed to hear this about your stay. Please know that the issue with upselling upon check-in has been addressed appropriately; there is no reason anyone should feel at all pressured to purchase anything. Our packages are meant to enhance a guest's experience, not hinder or annoy them. I sincerely apologize that you and your family were not regarded with excellent customer service and care - we expect all of our guests to be treated with sincere care, and we very clearly fell short during your stay. I will also certainly pass along your comments to our food & beverage and housekeeping teams regarding the issues you experienced with room cleanliness and our breakfast buffet. We are constantly striving to make improvements, so your feedback is a wonderful reflection of what we can do to change and grow. As an extension of my apology, I'd like to credit your World of Hyatt account 5,000 points, enough for a free night at some of our properties. We'd really love to welcome you back and show you the top-notch service we are capable of.

If there is anything else I can do to assist you, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Best wishes,

Emma Lee

I just wanted to let you know that our bathroom doors are actually in the works of getting updated, so I do apologize that yours was scratched up. Also, they are ""coolers "" in the rooms only because when it comes to safety issues with temperatures for things such as medicines etc, we cannot guarantee a specific temperature. Also, thank you for noting the leak, and bringing it to our attention. Our engineering department has taken care of the issue. Thank you for choosing the Hyatt Regency Green Bay and we hope to welcome you back soon.

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey and being a World of Hyatt member! We truly appreciate feedback, especially from those who are returning guests like your family. We strive to provide quality and service throughout our hotel and want to ensure we are meeting guest needs. It looks like we fell short during your dining experience and would like to apologize for the hummus order. I have spoken to a chef this evening to evaluate where we have missed a step so that we can prevent it from happening again. We apologize if this left your dining experience disappointing, we would like to buy you another roasted garlic hummus when you come visit Green Bay again. Please let me know if you have any upcoming stays so that we can take care of this for you. Additionally, we are so happy to hear about your overall experience and that your daughter enjoyed the cookies and milk. Belated happy birthday to her and we look forward to welcoming your family back in Green Bay!

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. I am pleased to hear that your overall stay was satisfactory. Thank you for the positive comments about our staff, guest rooms, and breakfast experience! I apologize if the ham & cheese sandwich special was not up to standards. This is our first year launching a market special for the Kitsune Kon. With the immensity of the convention, we tried to provide a variety of dining options. Please know that your feedback will be taken into consideration as we move forward to making plans for next year.

2018-07-28 16:54:07] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good evening Mr. Konowe,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey. I appreciate your loyalty as a World of Hyatt member, and furthermore, the feedback that you have given us. I was on the floor during breakfast this week at opening, and I apologize for the delay that you experienced. I did my best to speak with all guests that were affected by this and I must have missed you. I also see that we were 23 minutes late in getting you checked in to your room, and can imagine the frustration that comes with travel and having unexpected hiccups. Thank you for your patience in both of these instances. 

We are in the process of doing some new face lifts to the property, and our lobby was renovated and re-opened in January 2017. We are currently installing large expenditures in several areas of the operation that are anticipated to conclude prior to winter of this year. You are correct in your assumptions that this was a prior Embassy Suites, and we work hard to create a Hyatt Regency atmosphere everyday. I am glad to see that you enjoyed the gym (a definite favorite of other guests as well!), and that the staff was professional. I am however, sad to see that no one ever treated you warmly. Can you comment further on this, perhaps by the staff/department that you talked with? Additionally, I will make sure our Engineering team is alerted to the issue with the A/C noise level in room 335.

Please reach out with any additional feedback or comments. I hope you are having an enjoyable weekend, Mr. Konowe. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. I apologize that we fell short during your clients' stay. I assure you, we do our best to clean the hotel rooms up to standards after conventions in a timely manner, and I do acknowledge that the check-in time was past 3 PM, which is what we try to guarantee for our guests. We were not aware that this would happen to our guests, as we do our best to make sure that their stays are comfortable and convenient - we use this as a learning opportunity, and do our best to prevent situations such as this one every year. I was the one you spoke with upon your arrival regarding your clients, and I was concerned about their late check in. I did extend the $20 food & beverage credit to each client as well as a $10 discount off of each room for the inconvenience of the wait, along with a sincere apology for the delay. If you'd like to provide more detail about your room condition and the cleanliness, I'd be happy to pass along that feedback to our Housekeeping team so that we may identify our growth areas. We're also happy to remedy a situation in any way that we can via the front desk, such as the A/C issue. During a stay, a front desk host can be reached at any time by dialing 0 on the phone in your room.

Thank you again for your time, and if there is anything else I can do to assist you, please feel free to contact me. 

Best wishes,

Good morning,

Thank you for taking the time to fill out the guest satisfaction survey. I have reviewed the bill. The rate based on double occupancy was $109 per night plus tax. The reservation did reflect the double occupancy rate, charges for in Pub dining, and the parking of two vehicles.

I emailed a copy of the charges to dreshers@wctc.net. Please feel free to reach out with any further billing questions.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. It looks like overall you have enjoyed your stay during Kitsune Kon! In regards to your feedback, I was wondering if you could provide any specific details as to what kind of food options you were looking for? The Pub 333 had a special menu set in place to accommodate the immensity of the convention. We also had food trucks, variety of to-go specials at The Market and our atrium lunch sales. The convention also has a discounted price for a full breakfast buffet that had made to order omelet stations. Your response is greatly appreciated and we value your feedback which will be taken into consideration moving forward in the planning for next year.

Hello Mr Resch,

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. I'm disappointed to hear your arrival experience with us did not meet either of our expectations. Especially coming in after a long day of travel. I also apologize that we missed the opportunity to help make that right, by not providing you with a complimentary breakfast experience the following day. Please know that I will review the situation with our team to make sure we do things right should a similar situation present itself in the future.

As a gesture of apology, I will submit 2500 World of Hyatt points into your membership account to use toward future stays. We appreciate your loyalty to Hyatt.

If there's anything further I can do for you. Please let  me know.


Sincerely,

Lucas Boie

Hello Ms Thomas,

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. I am terribly disappointed to see your stay with us did not meet your expectations and you are questioning the Hyatt brand. I'm wondering if we might be able to set up a time for us to speak on the phone to discuss the details of your stay a little further. I'm happy to call you if there's a day that works best for you. Please let me know.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. I am pleased to hear that you enjoyed Kitsune Kon overall. We always look forward to having our Kitsune Kon guests as they are definitely a fun group. We also love that we get to wear fun t-shirts! I do apologize if we fell short for their dining experience. Our Pub333 had a special menu set in place so that we can accommodate the immensity of the group. Should you stop by the Pub333 or The Market next year, we have a variety of choices for food at your convenience. I am glad you had a positive experience with our staff as we strive to provide great quality and service throughout our hotel. Thank you and we look forward to working you all again next year!

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. We are pleased to hear about your positive comments about our staff and we are glad you had a great experience with Kitsune Kon overall. They are definitely a fun group, and we are glad you had some quiet time in the midst of the convention. I do apologize if we fell short during your dining experience. We do have our special menu in the Pub 333 set in place so that we can accommodate the immensity of the group. Our healthy options did consist of the Cobb Salad with your choice of dressing, and casesar or ranch wraps, with a side choice of assorted fruit. Please know that we can accommodate to guest dietary needs, and can be informed through our severs. Additionally, I do apologize about the tub drain and if it caused your shower to be uncomfortable. Should any issues arise during future stays, please let us know as we can gladly accommodate you. We want to ensure we are providing great quality and service throughout all areas of the hotel and your feedback will be utilized as a coaching opportunity. We look forward to possibly working with you again next year!

Thank you for your response. 
Regarding your menu, the cobb salad was noted on the menu, but my husband and I forego pork and cheese on our salads. The chicken wrap was the healthiest option offered. A caesar salad was not on the menu, unless this was sold at the market/Starbucks venue. Not many choices for vegetarians, lactose intolerant, or those looking for low-calorie options. I realize that you can't accommodate everyone.
I do appreciate your time and concern; Hyatt clearly cares about their guests. We will continue to patronize Hyatt hotels and enjoy your fine service and accommodation.
Best,
Mary Claypool

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. I am so sincerely sorry that your stay with us was less than desirable. We've spoken with our staff about demeanor and coached on the packages - you're right, every staff member should know about what is included in the packages, and we have used this as a learning opportunity to grow our staff. I have also spoken with the staff member you have mentioned at checkout, I again apologize for that experience, we hold ourselves to high standards of customer service and that is not at all how we'd like a guest to be treated. We do appreciate your loyalty of 10 years with us, we're always delighted to have you. In addition, about the laundry supplies, we do offer washing and drying supplies in our laundry areas on the 4th and 7th floor, otherwise we are happy to provide those at the front desk as well. I will also promptly pass along your feedback about the breakfast staff to our Outlets managers so that they may address the issues you experienced. 
I completely understand your frustrations, and as such, I'd like to ask for another chance to show you what we truly strive to represent at Hyatt. We want every guest to have a comfortable, convenient stay, and we'd like to do whatever it takes to get there. I'd also like to offer you complimentary breakfast for two if you do decide to stay with us again, should you find yourself in Green Bay.

If there is anything else I can assist you with, or if you do schedule a future stay, please don't hesitate to contact me. I'm happy to arrange anything that you may need during your stay personally, so that we may ensure your next visit is a clear contrast to this one.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, feedback from our guests is our best tool for identifying our growth areas. I have reviewed your reservation and unfortunately, upon booking, I do not see a floor or view indicated, which is what I believe led to the unfortunate misassignment of rooms. I do apologize for that miscommunication. I have added to your preferences that when staying with us, you would like a high floor and river view room, which will be taken into consideration for any future bookings. I'm also happy to credit your World of Hyatt account 1,000 points to use towards any future stay and/or services with any of our Hyatt properties. It appears the night you had arrived we were sold out, and that room was the only one we had vacant, however, I do understand the frustration that can come with getting a room type that is unlike the one preferred. Again, I apologize for the inconvenience that the room assignment caused you during your stay, and I do hope that you think of us if you find yourself in the Green Bay area again.

If there is anything else I can assist you with, please feel free to contact me.

Best wishes,

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey,  it is feedback from guests such as yourself that serves as the most useful tool to guide us in our growth and development. I really appreciate your comments regarding our staff, and sincerely thank you for your recommendations to your friends as well. However, I apologize for the inconvenience you encountered due to the reader on your guest room door. I appreciate you bringing this to our attention, I will pass this information along to our engineering team so that we may inspect it and fix it. I am glad, however, that the reader was the only issue you encountered. We would love to welcome you back as our guest, and again, thank you for your time and kind words.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, guest feedback is our best tool when looking for growth opportunities. I'm very pleased to see you enjoyed most of your time with us, and that you found our hotel staff friendly and courteous. However, I am sorry to hear that you didn't quite feel the same about your time spent in the KI Convention Center. I'll certainly relay your comments to our Banquets team so that we can use this as a coaching opportunity for the staff members who were serving the event you attended. Unfortunately, with the KI Convention Center being a separate entity from our hotel (though we do staff the events that occur there), I wish I could offer more on the commentary regarding the conference rooms and layout, but alas we don't have much power in that regard. However, I am happy to inform you that should this conference be held here in the future, we can certainly accommodate for any allergies as long as it is communicated to us before the date it is needed. We can certainly work with the event coordinator so that everyone has something they can enjoy. I will also pass these comments along to our Culinary team, so we may identify our areas of growth in that department.  Thank you again for your time and feedback, we greatly value your ratings and comments.

If there is anything else I can assist with, or if you would like me to communicate anything to our Culinary team for future stays, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, it is feedback from guests such as yourself that help us to identify our areas of growth and development. I sincerely apologize for the miscommunication and error regarding your reservation changes. We do certainly take responsibility for the mistakes made in adjusting those reservations for you, and I'm sorry that it was treated as an inconvenience to change that no show charge for you. I do see that it has been adjusted off of your folio accordingly now, so I'm glad to see that this matter was settled for you. I will certainly use this situation as a coaching opportunity for my staff should a situation arise like this in the future. I have also credited your World of Hyatt membership 2,000 points to use towards a future stay and/or services with any of our Hyatt properties. I apologize again for the error in our handling of this situation, and I do hope you think of us if you find yourself in the Green Bay area, we would love the opportunity to show you the top tier service we aim to provide to all of our guests.

If there is anything else I can do to assist you, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool to identify our areas of growth and development. I do apologize about the inconvenience of parking, I know that on busy days it can get quite crowded. We do have overflow parking in a few areas close to the hotel, to which any of our Front Desk Agents would be glad to direct you. We do wish we could provide more parking in our lot, unfortunately, due to our location downtown, we don't have any room for growth of our lot from what was originally included with the construction of the hotel. However, I do hope the rest of your stay with us was pleasant and that you had a relaxing, comfortable experience. 

If there is anything else I can do to assist you, please don't hesitate to contact me.

2018-07-19 17:52:31] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good evening Ms. Todey,

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. Guest feedback is our best tool in providing learning opportunities for our staff members. I do appreciate your comments on our staff member Kolton, he really is very pleasant and we are fortunate to have him as part of our team. I'll be sure to pass along the praise to him, I know he will be appreciative as well. I would like to inquire about the score you gave us on the ""Staff Sincerely Cared"" field, to see if you have any suggestions from your stay that we might use to improve our processes, as we do want every guest to know that we do genuinely care about them and their needs during a stay with us. 

Please don't hesitate to contact me if there is anything else I can assist you with, and I look forward to reviewing any details you choose to provide.

Best wishes,

Emma Lee
Assistant Front Office Manager
Hyatt Regency Green Bay

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. Your feedback is very important to us. I noticed you scored us significantly lower in a few areas of the survey. I was hoping you would share some details about your stay. This helps us to coach and mentor our staff to provide more enjoyable experiences to all of our future guests. Any details that you could provide would be greatly appreciated. We hope you will chose the Hyatt Regency Green bay on your next visit, and thank you for staying with us.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, it is feedback from guests such as yourself that assists us in identifying our areas of growth and development. I do apologize that you felt that our Front Desk Agent didn't want to help you due to your gender. I can assure you that was not the intention, as we do pride ourselves on maintaining a diverse and personable staff, though I do understand that there are situations in which things can be miscommunicated, which can negate intent. That being said, I was wondering if you could provide me with more details on the interaction that made you feel this way, so that I may coach my staff member to be more progressive in situations such as this one. We certainly don't want any of our guests feeling as if they are unwelcome or that we are unwilling to help them, as we are here to make your stay as pleasant and comfortable as possible. As far as the information on our website, we do currently have a request out to someone in our Central Office about updating the pricing of our parking, I'm sorry for any inconvenience that may have caused. I will certainly continue to coach all of our Front Desk Agents to provide this information at check-in so that all of our guests can be well-informed upon their arrival. If there is anything else you feel was not thoroughly answered, please let me know (if you are comfortable doing so), so that we may turn this into a learning opportunity. All of that being said, I hope that for the duration of your stay you got some good rest and had some positive experiences with some of our other staff members and areas of the hotel. I'd like to welcome you back to stay with us sometimes in the hopes we can provide you with the top tier experience we aim to give at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

If there is anything else I can assist you with, please don't hesitate to contact me. I look forward to reviewing any details you are willing to share with me about your check in experience with us. Thank you again for your time and feedback.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, it is our greatest tool in identifying our areas of growth. I do apologize for the inconvenience you experienced during your stay, I can completely understand how something like that would disrupt your entire vacation. I am happy to see that Kolton handled the situation efficiently, and I do see a credit was applied to your account in addition to the room move, so I'm glad you were somehow compensated for this event. We do take guest safety very seriously and events like these are certainly ones we try to avoid, so again I sincerely apologize that something like this occurred in our guest room. I am pleased to inform you that that shelving unit was secured and evaluated by our engineering team, though I only regret that it took an event like this to bring the issue to our attention. However, we do hope to invite you back sometime and show you a wonderful time during your stay. Your birthday should be a time full of good rest and happiness, and I'm upset to see that's not what it was for you this year. 

If you do stay with us again, please reach out to me directly so I may personally inspect your guest room and arrange something special for your birthday, if that is the occasion that brings you back to us. Again, I apologize for the negatives in your stay, but we'd love to have you as a guest with us again so that we may really deliver a top tier experience.

Thank you again for your time and feedback, and please don't hesitate to reach out to me if there is anything else I may assist you with.

I do sincerely apologize on behalf of our staff and on behalf of any customer service people you may have spoken with for the inconvenience with your folio. I am happy to see that it got rectified, I see the amount was adjusted accordingly. We do certainly encourage our staff to offer a copy of the folio at the time of check-out, either in print form, email, or both. I will be sure to reinforce this as a learning opportunity. I can also certainly put on your guest profile your preference for this, so that we may put a printed copy under your door or email it in the future, to avoid any issues such as the one you experienced during your most recent stay. Please let me know if that's something you would like me to do. That being said, I'm delighted to see that you enjoyed the rest of your stay, including staff interactions and the games in our lobby area. Thank you again for your time and feedback.

Thank you for completing our guest satisfaction survey. Your feedback is very important to us as we use it to continually learn and grow. I would like to apologize about the tobacco can. Of course this does not meet our expectations of the cleanliness of the room and I am sorry that you had to find that. I am glad to hear that the hotel staff were helpful and professional.  I understand that you were upset over being charged  for parking, so I just wanted to explain that to you briefly, in hopes you would understand the charge.Due to our location downtown and limited parking options and access to the convention center, however,  our overnight guests receive discounted parking with in and out privileges in lieu of generating an hourly rate throughout the stay which is actually much cheaper than the parking ramp attached to the hotel via sky walk. I am glad to hear you enjoyed your stay and if there is anything else you would like to discuss please do not hesitate to reach out to me. Thank you for staying with us, and we hope to welcome you back for your next visit to Green Bay.

Thank you for responding to my feedback.  While I do completely understand
charging those who are not staying at the hotel, I still find it quite
disappointing that you would charge guests who have made the decision to
book a room at the hotel, even at a discounted rate.  Guests should get
first priority and anyone outside of that should use the ramp or have to
pay to keep their vehicle in the lot.  Might even be a good marketing
strategy for the Greeny Bay location. Give guests free parking during their
stay, you'll probably fill more rooms.  I would also recommend making it
clear to guests that you will charge them ahead of time since I did not
find out until I got to the hotel.  While we did enjoy our stay overall,
these little things like parking and garbage being on the floor in the room
will have us considering other options on our next visit.  Again, that you
for taking the time to respond to me.
Regards,
Jamie

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, it is feedback from guests such as yourself that assists us in identifying our areas of growth and delivering more quality experiences. I do appreciate your feedback on our Housekeeping services, and I will certainly pass that along to our Housekeeping team so that they may use this as a learning opportunity. I sincerely apologize that the level of service was not up to standards, I understand how things like that can impact a guest's stay. I'm glad to hear that our Engineering team was great in their attempts to be helpful, and I will certainly suggest to our Operations team that we include instructions that would apply to Apple products, to alleviate this problem in the future. I've also noted your comments about the temperatures of the guest room, I understand that despite our efforts, sometimes the heating/cooling system does not get to a comfortable range for every guest. We are happy to provide extra blankets, space heaters, or fans to help make your stay more comfortable. If you should require any of these items, please don't hesitate to contact our front desk, we are delighted to have the opportunity to do all that we can to make your stay as optimal as possible. Again, I would like to thank you for your time and feedback so that we may focus on these areas of growth.

If there is anything else I can do to assist you, please don't hesitate to contact me. 

Best wishes,

Good Morning Andrew, 

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. Your feedback is very valuable as we use it to continually learn and grow.  I apologize that you didn't find the condition of the hotel up to par. We are currently beginning several projects in the rooms to ""upgrade"", including the bathroom doors! I hope that you enjoyed the rest of your stay and we look forward to welcoming you back on your next visit to Green Bay.

We have always been pleased with our stays but the last time we stayed we got charged for 6 breakfast meals even though our room rate was supposed to include some of them.  This time we had numerous things that disappointed us.  
1- there was a significant price increase of about $50 compared to previous stays.
2- we had to pay $7 for parking in a lot that is in no way secure
3 - we had to pay $1 to leave the parking lot when we went to run errands
4 - we weren’t even able to exit out of one of the parking exits so we had to back out and use the other enterance/exit
5 - our room was mediocre at best (no bathroom fan, shower curtain was dirty, carpeting was loose and rippled through the dining/living room area)
6 - we called for a roll away bed and told one would be sent up right away, we waited for an hour and had to call again
7 - many rude and obnoxious pool goers with inadequate adult supervision which effected the ability of my younger children to enjoy or feel safe during their experience
8 - and truly the icing on the cake was that despite having a validated parking ticket when we had checked out and were leaving it wanted to charge us $18 to exit.  We again had to back up and return to the service counter to complain about this and told they would open the gate for us as we leave if we press the silver button.  Seriously after already having paid $8 just to park a freaking vehicle alone you try to get $18 more as we leave!

Bottom line the value of the room itself is not worth what is being charged and when I travel 4 hours with 4 kids the last thing I want is to feel like I’m being held captive by absolutely ridiculous parking fees.  For the room rate and all the added expenses we could have stayed at an actual hotel water park and had an overall generally more enjoyable experience than just a night in a basic hotel.

Thank you for your elite membership with World of Hyatt, and for taking time to give us such a detailed account of your experience with us. I am extremely disappointed that we let you down with multiple concerns during your time with us, and was hoping that I could speak with you personally about the details of your stay. I will be in the office on Tuesday, and was hoping you could provide me with a time that would be good for you to talk so that I can discuss your stay with you and go over your experience at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. 

I look forward to hearing from you soon, and greatly appreciate your time.

First I'd like to thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest survey and for being a member of World of Hyatt with us. I sincerely apologize for the state of the bathroom upon your arrival, I can completely understand how something like that can impact a stay. I'd like to extend 500 points to your World of Hyatt account to go towards future stays and/or services for the inconvenience you experienced. Please give the system a couple of days to reflect that contribution. I am however, very happy to hear that the rest of your stay was pleasant and accommodating. I'll be sure to pass along your comments to our Food & Beverage team as well as our Front Desk staff, I know they'll be delighted to hear your feedback as well. Again, thank you for your time and feedback, guest responses are our best tool for identifying our growth areas.

First I'd like to thank you for completing our guest satisfaction survey and for being a World of Hyatt member with us. Feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool in identifying new ways to learn and grow. I'm sorry to hear that your stay was less than satisfactory, though. I do understand your frustration with the temperature, as it is controlled as a whole hotel unit as opposed to each room individually, due to the original construction of the hotel. However, we do have options available to you, such as space heaters or extra blankets, should the temperature not meet your individual needs. I would also encourage you to contact the front desk for any and all needs during your stay, we do have a staff member on 24/7, and I'd have loved to rectify the bathroom sink drainage issue for you so that you didn't have to deal with that. I'd also like to let you know that you did earn World of Hyatt points for your stay, which can be utilized towards future stays and/or services, and your membership does allow us to add preferences to your profile (such as higher floor, lower floor, away from elevator, prefers a certain view), which I am happy to personally set up for you if you have any you would like us to accommodate. Thank you again for your time and feedback, we do hope if you ever find yourself in Green Bay again that you think of us.

If there is anything else I can assist you with, please don't hesitate to contact me.

2018-07-15 18:18:31] Email received from: Jeff Keyser <jeffkeyser@aol.com>: Thanks Emma.  One question ... if the temp is operated as a whole hotel unit, why do you have thermostats in each room?  Are they just there to make guests feel like they can control the temp in their room?  I messed with that thing over and over.  Asked the front desk and was told to turn it up as high as it would go and, of course, it did nothing.  Actually, now I’m not sure why I got that response from the front desk.  Seems like you should put a sign up that says you can’t control the temperature in the room instead of letting guests mess around with a thermostat that does nothing.  I appreciate your response, but it’s not addressing the issue.  I’m really not that into discussing room temperatures generally, but this seems well below Hyatt standards. Not to mention the ridiculous parking charges.  Thanks again for the response.

I would also encourage you to contact the front desk for any and all needs during your stay, we do have a staff member on 24/7, and I'd have loved to rectify the bathroom sink drainage issue for you so that you didn't have to deal with that. I'd also like to let you know that you did earn World of Hyatt points for your stay, which can be utilized towards future stays and/or services, and your membership does allow us to add preferences to your profile (such as higher floor, lower floor, away from elevator, prefers a certain view), which I am happy to personally set up for you if you have any you would like us to accommodate. Thank you again for your time and feedback, we do hope if you ever find yourself in Green Bay again that you think of us.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, feedback from our guests is our best tool to identify areas of growth. I apologize that your stay didn't quite meet standards regarding room condition. We certainly appreciate your comments, and I will pass them along  to the appropriate departments so that we can make improvements. I also wanted to inquire about your rating in the ""Staff Sincerely Cared"" category, I was wondering if there was any specific instance that we could have handled better for you, I'd like the opportunity to show you that we really do value you as our guest. I hope that if you ever find yourself in Green Bay, that you think of us, we'd love the chance to 'wow' you on your next visit.

If there's anything else I can assist with, please don't hesitate to contact me.

i appreciate your timely response!
I will be moving to Green Bay from the Chicago area within 6-8 weeks.
I love it there, and have always enjoyed my several visits  in such a great place to live and play.
Should there be a need for accomadations during the move transition, I will not hesitate tostay there. And,  I will indeed recommend the Hyatt should there be a need from (hopefully!)visiting family or friends.
Best regards from a soon to be Green Bay resident,

First of all I'd like to thank you both for being a World of Hyatt member with us and also for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. We appreciate feedback from our guests as it helps us identify our growth areas and improve upon them. That being said, I sincerely apologize that we didn't have your room ready until 4 PM when check-in is meant to occur at 3 PM. We did drop the ball on that one, and I apologize for the impact that had on your stay, though we certainly appreciate your patience with us during that time. I also apologize for the coffee pot in your room. If ever you encounter an issue like that, please don't hesitate to contact us at the front desk (just in case you didn't during this stay), and we would certainly be more than happy to replace that for you so that you're able to enjoy your stay to the fullest. 
I'm so happy to hear though that you had a wonderful experience with us, and I appreciate your comments on the customer service, I'll be sure to relay that to our teams here. If there is anything else I can assist you with, please don't hesitate to contact me. Thank you again for your time and feedback!

I do understand that we arrived the day after the 4th and that you were
very busy cleaning, I dealt with the late room by putting my things in my
brother's room, but it would have been rather challenging if he wasn't
already there.  I am not upset at all about the way things went and I would
like to say one more time that your staff was truly incredible.  That
matters more to me than my check-in :-)

Thank you so much for your kind words regarding our staff, I know they appreciate your praise just as much as I do. I also very much appreciate your understanding regarding the housekeeping situation. Hopefully we never run into that predicament again, but should it arise, please know that we do have complimentary luggage storage at the Front Desk, for situations like this or for any other occasion. We are more than happy to store anything in our secure luggage room for your convenience.
Again, it was a delight to have you as our guest, and I hope that should you ever find yourself in Green Bay, you think of us. We’d love to welcome you back to the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. We truly appreciate your feedback as we utilize them as a learning opportunity. I am pleased to hear you had a positive staff interaction and guest room experience! I apologize if we fell short during your dining experience with the service and the breakfast buffet. We do offer Ala Carte to order or coffee and pastries for purchase at the Market if you prefer a variety. Additionally, there are also alternative restaurants for breakfast in downtown Green Bay should you ever visit the area again. Please know that your response will be used as a coaching opportunity as we want to ensure we are providing great quality and service throughout our hotel. Thank you and we look forward to welcoming you back in the future!

First I'd like to thank you for completing our guest satisfaction survey and for being a World of Hyatt member with us. Feedback from guests such as yourself is our greatest tool for identifying areas of growth. I will certainly pass on your comments to our Food & Beverage team for review on pricing of breakfast, and in the meantime I would like to inform you that depending on the age of the children, we do offer discounted rates. Children 5 years of age and under are eligible for free buffet admission; our breakfast servers would be happy to extend that to you, they just need to be informed of how many children are of that age. We do also offer a la carte options if you feel that your children may prefer a specific food, which may also save money from the standard $12.50 rate. I also apologize for the experience you had at check-in. I can assure you we were aware of the wedding, we were honored and delighted that the bride and groom, as well as guests such as yourself, decided to stay with us on their special day. However, I'm very sorry if you felt that our staff member did not recognize this, and that check-in was not as smooth a process as we aim for it to be. I will certainly use this as a coaching opportunity for our Front Desk Agents for future occurrences. I am, however, very pleased to hear that you enjoyed the omelets and the quality of your room. I only wish we could have exceeded your expectations in all categories. Thank you again for your time and feedback.

Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with, especially if there is a future stay with us. I'd be happy to personally see to anything you may need upon your arrival.

Best wishes,

First I'd like to thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. I also see that you've spent the past few years with us during the Fourth of July, and we greatly appreciate your choice to stay with us, it's a pleasure having you as our guest. However, I notice in some of the categories of the survey we fell a little short. I was wondering if you would like to provide any further feedback that may assist us in identifying some growth areas. We are always looking to improve, and feedback from loyal guests such as yourself is our best tool. 

Again, thank you for your time, and please don't hesitate to contact me with further details or anything else I can assist you with.

We hope to see you next Fourth of July!

First of all I'd like to thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. We appreciate the feedback from our guests, as it helps us identify our areas of growth and improve upon them. I see your comments about being charged for parking, and I just wanted to clarify something I see on your folio with us. It appears you were here for two nights, and we did credit off one of the nights for parking. Were you located in the Main Street ramp for both of the days/nights of your stay? If so, I'm more than happy to credit that back to your account. I just wanted to clarify because we do have the $7.00 fee daily, so if one night was in the ramp and the other was in our lot, that would explain the charge. Please let me know, so that I'm able to rectify our mistake if you were in the Main Street ramp during the entirety of your stay. I do apologize for that misunderstanding. 
I'm very happy to hear, however, that you enjoyed the rest of your stay with us, especially regarding the customer service and pool area!
If you would, please let me know how to proceed with the question outlined above, and if there is anything else I can assist you with, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Again, thank you so much for your time and feedback, and we hope to welcome you back during your next trip to Green Bay!

First of all I'd like to thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, we always appreciate the feedback, it's our best tool to identify our areas of growth. It appears you were put in one of our Studio King rooms during your stay. It does differ from the one bedroom king style, which is the more traditional room with a small hallway separating the living room area and the bedroom. The studio style is more expansive, as you stated, to offer a more open concept for guests who may not like the feel of a traditional room. Due to the desire to create a spacious feeling, we do opt for a larger, mounted TV as opposed to the TVs placed on the dressers in the bedrooms of the one bedroom suites. I do understand how this room may have been startlingly different from rooms you may have experienced at other Hyatts. If you would like, I'm happy to make a note on your profile that you do not like the studio style rooms, so that we can ensure you are placed in a room that would better suit your tastes and comfort. I apologize if the features of this room lessened the experience for you during your stay, we do aim to make it as comfortable for you as possible. 
I am happy, however, that your staff interactions were great. I believe I was the one who checked you in, and it was a pleasure meeting you and having you as our guest.

If there is anything else I can do to assist you, or if you'd like me to pre-arrange a room for you for any future visits to Green Bay, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Best wishes,

Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay.  In order to accommodate your early check-in, I did notify you of the layout of the room before assigning the room to you, including the studio open concept as well as it not having a window.  It was unfortunately the only room available at the time.  I wish you would have called me after checking in so I could offer you the next clean available room.  I am sorry you experienced such dissatisfaction.  I have made a note to your profile to never assign a studio concept room, especially room 313.  Please reach out to me directly for assistance in the future so I may insure proper assignment.  I appreciate you choosing to stay with us and hope this does not deter you from giving us the opportunity to take care of you when you find yourself in Green Bay.

2018-07-08 18:05:19] Email received from: Bridget M <manganbh413@gmail.com>: Thank you for your response Kristin.  Overall my experience at the Green
Bay Hyatt was great, and I am happy I stayed there.  I visit Green Bay 2-3
times a year when vacationing in other areas in the Green Bay area.  I
checked my receipt and it was $7 for parking not $10, I apologize for my
error.  I think I was just surprised that this was an added expense
considering there did not appear to be any major events going on at that
time.  The $7 is not a huge deal, however something I was surprised by, and
will need to keep in mind the next time I book a trip to Green Bay and when
I am comparing other hotels.
Other than that the hotel was kept nicely, and the staff were all
friendly.  If the price is right I would consider staying at the Hyatt
again depending on rates I could get at other Green Bay locations.
Thank you.
Bridget Mangan

Thank you for providing feedback regarding your recent stay.  I am sorry Google Maps gave you wrong directions as I have not heard of this issue before.  We are always looking for training opportunities to improve our service; I apologize for the delayed check-in.  Would you be able to explain how the check-in process affected your wait time, i.e. long line, slow service with associate, short staffed?  As a Discoverist, your comments and experience in travel are valuable.  We strive to provide excellence in service and it is members like you that help us understand how to better serve you.  I look forward to hearing from you and appreciate you choosing to stay with us.

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. I am pleased to hear your positive comment about our breakfast service and will relay the message to our team! It looks we fell short for your guest room stay and your dining experience at our Pub333. I would like to apologize for the appetizer order that took too long, we want to ensure we are providing timely service and meeting guest expectations throughout all areas of the hotel. Additionally, we want to ensure that you have a comfortable stay whether you were travelling for leisure or business and I apologize if the air conditioner was very loud in the room. We would be happy to have engineering take a look at any issues or have our front desk host accommodate you should this happen again in the future. Please know that we will utilize this as a learning opportunity and that your feedback is truly appreciated.

Sincerely,

Thank you for staying with us again at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. I'm pleased to see you enjoyed your guest room and we appreciate your return patronage. I am sorry to hear your experience in the atrium left you feeling unwelcome and apologize if that was the case. Please know that the policy referenced at the time is based on liquor licensing laws and not a discretionary policy that we have. We know the lobby/atrium is great place to socialize and that's the experience we are hoping for. The policy is certainly not meant personally on any one guests experience. I would be happy to discuss in more detail as well as discuss how might make you feel better about returning for another visit with us. Please let me know, and I can reach out directly at a time of your convenience.

Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay and for choosing Hyatt Regency Green Bay.  I am glad the kids were able to enjoy themselves with our games and breakfast buffet.  I hope they were able to spend time in the pool as well!  I am sorry you had to wait for your room upon arrival and would like to make sure that does not happen the next time you come to visit.  Please let me know if I can ever be of assistance, even for early arrival should you find yourself ahead of schedule.  Thank you again for choosing to stay with us; we look forward to seeing you again!

Thank you for providing feedback regarding your stay; your comments are valuable to us and I appreciate your honesty about how the overflow of parking affected your stay.  With so many things needed in preparation for the special occasion of a wedding I understand your frustration.  Our staff is here to serve you and should have offered to help unload your belongings at our front entrance and escort you to your room before parking.  Security is also on staff 24 hours a day to address any noise issues and focus on alleviating any disturbances throughout the night.  I am sorry our guests were loud when returning to the hotel.  I hope the wedding and reception were beautiful.  Being the mother of the bride, I am sure things can get quite hectic with last minute details.  Please feel free to reach out to me should you need any future assistance and thank you for staying with us for such joyous event.

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. We value our guests feedback and appreciate your comments. I'm pleased to see you enjoyed most aspects of your stay but I'm sorry to hear your son's sleep was disrupted from noise in the atrium. We know how important a good night's rest is.

We appreciate your feedback and hope to see you back again soon.

Thank you for your continued  patronage with Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am certainly disappointed that you experienced a delayed check-in time, and as such, have refunded $40 to the credit card you had on file; we appreciate your kind and understanding comments, and want you to know that we care and understand the frustration that you as the guest would have experienced. I am glad to see that our team was professional, courteous and able to adequately handle the various types of guests and events that were in the hotel during your stay, and will definitely share your comments about the food with our Executive Chef so that we can use this feedback to redouble our efforts and actions as we move forward with servicing the next incoming guest. 

I am glad to hear that you will be back, and I hope you had a great 4th of July! Thank you again for providing us with your feedback and please enjoy the rest of your week.

Thank you for your patronage and loyalty with Hyatt Hotels & Resorts. I am glad to see that everything, with the exception of the incident mentioned in your survey, went well and that you enjoyed your time here. The request for your points has been submitted and this is generally viewable on the guest end within 10 business days. With that being said, you should be able to see them by July 11th. As the person that escorted you to your room with the situation clear in my mind, I went ahead and increased the point amount to 5,000-the amount required at our property for a full, complimentary night. 

I will monitor your account membership daily when I begin my work day to see if the points have made it to your account. When I have seen this, I will send you another email confirming the point status. 

Thank you again for staying with us; I hope you had a great 4th of July!

Hello Ms Bastien,

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. We value our guests feedback and appreciate your comments on the hotel and the bathroom in your suite. If there was anything else during your stay that would have inclined you to rate your likelihood to recommend a 10 over a 6, please let us know, and we can work on improving.

Appreciate the email and wanting to hear feedback from me. My husband and I
stayed at the King Suite and we both thought that the bathrooms were fairly
small, especially for a suite. Additionally, the carpeting was dark and
seemed outdated. A lot of the newer (or ""updated"") places we've stayed at
has vinyl/tile, etc flooring which can be kept much cleaner.
We did enjoy the stay and loved how it was two sections; the bedroom and
""living"" area. The lobby and how the rooms were arranged, like an open
courtyard is extremely beautiful as well. You don't see many hotels like
that anymore.

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey! I am pleased to hear you had positive experiences with our staff interactions and guest rooms. We want to ensure we are providing valued experience and service, even when travelling for business. I do see that you stayed with us during the weekday and although our breakfast hours are from 6:30-9:30 AM, I apologize if it was not flexible to meet the starting work time. Our front desk also serves regular coffee for purchase starting at 4 am until The Market opens at 6:30 am. They also serve grab-and-go items or pastries in the morning for your convenience. If you prefer to have breakfast brought at a specific time, we offer room service breakfast as well. I hope you have a chance to try our other breakfast alternatives and start your day with ample time. We look forward to welcoming you back! Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance for your upcoming stays.

I apologize again for missing some opportunities during your stay, including your room assignment and the wait for your food. When we make mistakes, we know we need to make it right and I'm pleased to hear you appreciated the discount on your overall room charges. Additionally, we appreciate your feedback on the buffet options and I'm pleased to hear you had some great interactions with our team members.

We hope to see you back again at Hyatt Regency Green Bay again in the future.

The food and beverage and service at the Pub was fine. I just expected a hotel of that caliber to have an alternative steak seafood restaurant as well. Two weeks ago we ate at Mr G’s at the DFW Hyatt regency and it was probably our best restaurant experience of the year. The front desk people were great especially Matthew who checked on us frequently.  The only problem was there was only one person there on check in and check out. They need some more support.

Thank you for your quick response and I am glad you had great interactions with the front desk and the service at the Pub. I will ensure to relay your message to Matthew about your positive comments and the support needed at the front desk at the time. I apologize if we did not have an alternative steak restaurant as well. As we do have competitive and alternative restaurants downtown Green Bay, I hope you have a chance to return and visit other great restaurants in the area.
Thank you and we look forward to welcoming you back in the future!

Hello Ms Mancia,

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. Our guest feedback is our most important tool and we highly value this input from our guests. Based on your scores in a number of areas, I'm disappointed to see we were not able to meet your expectations during your stay with us. I'm wondering if you might be able to provide and specific detail on your experience with us that led to these shortcomings. Your additional time and feedback is much appreciated.

First of all I'd like to thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and for being a World of Hyatt Globalist with us. That being said, I genuinely apologize that your stay was less than satisfactory. We've gone ahead and issued you 5,000 points to your World of Hyatt membership for the inconveniences, and I have also submitted a request to maintenance for the issues noted with the room, which I thank you for bringing to our attention. You should be seeing those points deposited over the next few business days. Your feedback is very much appreciated and important to us, as it helps us identify our areas of growth. I'll also certainly pass along your comments about staff interactions, I'm so glad that we were able to extend our care to you in that way. Please know that we also felt you were an absolute delight to engage with. If there is anything else I can do for you, please don't hesitate to reach out. Again, thank you for your time, and we look forward to welcoming you back someday!

First of all I'd like to thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey, and for being a member of World of Hyatt. I sincerely apologize that your stay here was less than satisfactory. We will certainly use this as a coaching opportunity for our Front Desk Agents, to remind them to inform our guests about the daily parking fee. I also noticed that we scored fairly low in all categories aside from Food & Beverage, would you like to provide more details about your experience? We'd certainly like an opportunity to rectify our mistakes, and our best learning tool is feedback from thoughtful guests such as yourself. Again, I'm very sorry that we missed the mark on multiple occasions during your stay. However, I'm delighted to see your comments about Kristin, I'll be sure to pass that along to her. If there is anything else I can do for you, or if you'd like to provide additional details, please don't hesitate to contact me. I'd also be happy to personally see to anything you may need during a stay in the future. Thank you again for your time and honesty, and we look forward to exceeding expectations during your next visit.

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. Your feedback is very important to us, as we use it to continually learn and grow. I was sorry to hear that you were disappointed with your room. We do have ADA accommodations available upon request. Those rooms do have the grab bar by both the toilet and the shower, the bathrooms are also larger. We also do our best to honor all of our high floor requests. I will follow up with our culinary team as well regarding your overcooked hashbrowns, and I apologize that they were not replaced in a timely matter. If you would like to discuss any other details regarding your stay, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. Thank you for staying at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

Greetings Ms. Miller,

Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay and for choosing to stay with us.  I am sorry it took so long find a handicap accessible room.  Please know that the $25 upgrade charge was for the breakfast package and not the room type.  We would never charge extra for handicap accessibility.  Please feel free to contact me for any future assistance in ensuring a handicap room is reserved appropriately for any upcoming stays with us.  I hope you enjoyed your time with us; we truly enjoyed the energy your group brought to the hotel. Thank you again for staying with us and let me know if there is anything I can do for you!

2018-06-29 16:23:52] Email received from: Carol Miller <maplemill@att.net>: Thank you Kristin for your response to my feedback and the clarification on the $25 upgrade charge. It cancels my doubts previously expressed. My misunderstanding about the upgrade charge might have been avoided if it been identified as the breakfast package on the statement. The breakfasts were fantastic and well worth the upgrade.Thanks again,Carol

First I'd like to thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, and for being a World of Hyatt member. Your comments are greatly appreciated, and help us to identify our areas of growth. I sincerely apologize that your stay didn't meet expectations, I know how miserable it can be to be stuck in a room that's too warm. I'll certainly pass along your comments to our engineering team about your room to see if we can fix this error, but I'm sorry that the room did not prove to be in top condition during your stay. However, I'm happy to see your interactions with the rest of our hotel met the standards we like to hold ourselves to, and I hope overall your experience in Green Bay was a satisfactory one. If there is anything else I can do to assist you, please don't hesitate to contact me. Thank you again for your time, and I look forward to welcoming you back and showing you our best.

Best wishes,

Thank you for filling out our experience survey and providing valuable feedback.  I would like to apologize for the manner and amount of time it took to locate a hair dryer.  A request should never take that long and is not our standard.  We're always looking for ways to customize your World of Hyatt experience.  I have updated your preference for a quiet room located away from any mechanical rooms and traffic noise.  I hope you enjoyed the conference as much as we enjoyed having you with us.  I appreciate you choosing to stay with us and hope you think of us when you find yourself in Green Bay.

Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay and for choosing to stay with us.  I'm glad you enjoyed comfortable layout of the room fitting for four women.  Unfortunately with the age of the building, the bathrooms were made on the smaller side with no vents and I understand that frustration.  We do have some risers for the toilets upon request should you need them.  As we are always looking for ways to improve our rooms, your suggestion for hooks in the bathroom will most certainly be passed on to our management.  I hope you think of us the next time you are staying in Green Bay and please let us know if you have any special requests to prepare for your arrival.  Thank you again for choosing the Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

I would like to thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay.  I am sorry our hotel entrance was hard to find, making it difficult to come in to check-in to your room.  When a conference holding attendees in large numbers such as yours, overflow parking is necessary as we cannot accommodate for multiple vehicles per room.  I did check your bill just to be sure you were not charged for hotel parking.  Please rest assured you were not charged and parking fees for Hyatt parking.  I hope you enjoyed the conference and your overall experience at the hotel; we truly enjoyed having the Lutheran Women's conference here and hope you think of us should you find yourself in Green Bay again.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, as these are used throughout the hotel as learning opportunities for our colleagues.  I'm sorry to see that you left feeling your experience with our service was lacking. Our guests feedback is our greatest tool, and I'm wondering if there were any specific details you might be willing to share that led you to score us a 0 (zero) in the customer service field?  Thank you again for your time spent filling out our survey as well as staying with us, we look forward to welcoming you back for future visits here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. 

Best wishes,

First I'd like to sincerely thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey and for being a World of Hyatt member with us! Your feedback is very important to us and helps us to identify our areas of growth and any issues within the hotel. A maintenance request has been placed for room 432, and all of your feedback has been noted. We appreciate you bringing this to our attention, though I sincerely apologize that it wasn't in good repair for your visit.  I will also be sure to pass along your comments regarding the towels to our Housekeeping department, so that they may use this as a learning opportunity. If you'd like, for any return visit, please feel free to contact me and I'm happy to set something up in your profile to ensure that you will always receive the number of towels needed for you and all of your guests. Again, I apologize for the less than satisfactory experiences during your visit, as we always aim to make your stay as comfortable and positive as we can. We will certainly be utilizing your review to make improvements.

Thank you again for your time in filling out our guest satisfaction survey. If there is anything else I can to do assist you, or if there are any other comments you may have, please don't hesitate to contact me.

I am so glad you enjoyed your stay with us and thank you for your kind comments about your check-in experience.  It really made my day!  I am sorry that the a la carte menu was not available during your stay.  In order to accommodate such a large group, the a la carte menu was halted for the weekend.  I understand the frustration of preferring a singular dish versus having to order the buffet.  I hope you find yourself in Green Bay again and return to visit us to enjoy our breakfast menu as well as our relaxing hot tub, sauna, and steam room; your group was very much on the go!  Thank you so much for staying with us; we truly enjoyed having your group with us!

Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay and for choosing to stay with us.  I hope you enjoyed your time with us and choose to return should the conference find themselves back in Green Bay.  I wish we would have known of your preference for a lock box to secure times during your stay.  Although we do not have them located in our guest rooms, we do have safety deposit boxes available for guest use at the front desk.  We certainly enjoyed the energy the Lutheran Women's Conference brought to the hotel.  Please let me know if there is anything I can do for you  and thank you again for choosing the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

We strive to provide great experiences, as well as timely service for our guests. We truly value your feedback as we utilize these as learning opportunities for our property. Please let me know if there's anything else I can be of assistance and we hope to welcome you back in the future.

First I'd like to thank you for taking the time to respond to our guest satisfaction survey, and for being a member of World of Hyatt. I'm sorry to hear that your stay didn't quite meet expectations though, due to the issue with the fan in the bathroom. Unfortunately, because of the age and initial construction of the building, the bathrooms weren't created with venting mechanisms. However, I'll be sure to pass along the comments to the appropriate parties so we may consider doing something to make our guest experience more enjoyable. I appreciate your feedback, as it greatly helps us in identifying our areas of growth. I'm very happy to see that your staff interactions were pleasant and that we met standards in that regard. Again, I thank you for your time and look forward to welcoming you back. If there is anything else I can assist you with, please don't hesitate to contact me. 

Best wishes,

Thank you sincerely for filling out our guest satisfaction survey, as your feedback is critical in targeting any areas we have for growth and improvement. I'm so happy to hear about your positive experience with Teresa! She is truly a great addition to our team, and I'll be sure to pass along the praise. I also appreciate your feedback on our other staff members, we always aim to make your stay as pleasant and comfortable as possible, so I'm glad we were able to do so. That being said, I apologize for the noise from the atrium causing a lack of tranquility in your room. We do try to enforce quiet hours throughout the hotel, but I know there is always room for improvement, which your reviews will certainly help us with. I will also gladly pass along your suggestion about the fridge as opposed to the cooler, I can certainly see the value in having something that can get a little colder!

If there is anything else I can assist with or any further concerns, please don't hesitate to contact me, I'm happy to help!

Again, I thank you for your time and comments in this survey, I hope you have a wonderful rest of your week!

Best wishes,

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest experience survey and being a World of Hyatt member with us! We utilize these as learning opportunities for future accommodations as we strive to provide great service for all our guests. I would like to apologize for the lack of timely service with your pizza order and that we fell short during your dining experience. We will use this as a coaching opportunity to ensure we avoid it from happening again. Additionally, I want to apologize for the confusion you encountered at the front desk and if it has caused any inconvenience. After communicating with the front office manager and looking over your bill, we want to ensure that you get the credit for your stay and that we properly settle it for you. The front office manager would like to confirm the details of your credit card so that we can process it to your account right away. Please feel free to contact me or Kristin, the front office manager at the information below. Thank you and we look forward to welcoming you back in the future.

I would like to thank you for providing feedback regarding your stay and for choosing to make Hyatt your home away from home. As a loyal guest, your comfort is our top priority and I am disheartened to hear of you the lack of housekeeping service during your stay.  If this was the condition of your room upon check in we should have offered you a room move.  Your experience will be shared with our staff.

I would like to thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay and for choosing to stay with us.  We appreciate people entering our membership program so that we can cater to their needs and learn their preferences to customize our service during each stay.  As our members move into upgraded tiers, there are additional benefits extended to them.  I am sorry if our staff made you feel less of a member for not being in a tier that receives complimentary water throughout the stay instead of upon arrival only.  The gesture of extra water is a small way to show appreciation and should have been provided as a courtesy.  I would like to apologize for the confusion with the coffee service and delivery.  I followed up with the manager from the restaurant and it seems they were mistook the request for getting fresh coffee to replace the poor quality coffee that had been delivered with that of a request for an additional order.    I appreciate your honesty and hope this incident does not deter you from returning to Hyatt as the service you experienced is not the standard we pride ourselves with.  Please feel free to contact me directly should you need any future assistance and accept my sincere apologies.

Hello Mr Ray,

Thank you for staying with us again at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. We appreciate your continued loyalty to our property as well as the insight on the details of your experience with us this time. I apologize for the issues you encountered in getting your room refreshed during your visit. That is certainly not our standard and it should not be that difficult for you to make that happen. We are here to serve and facilitate the needs of our guests. Please be assured that I will review the situation with our team members for improvement, should similar situations arise in the future. Additionally, I'm sorry to hear your nights rest was disturbed by the noise from the road. I will make sure we enter some details stating you prefer the other side of the building for future stays. We also appreciate your feedback on the rest of your stay. We are constantly looking for ways to improve and will consider it all moving forward. We will definitely be replacing all of the beds this summer and hope to do some further updates on the rooms next year, although those details are not definite at this time.

As a gesture of apology for the issues you experience this stay and a token of appreciation for you continued loyalty. We will refund one of the night's room and tax from your stay.

If there's anything further I can do for you, please let me know


Sincerely,

Lucas Boie

2018-06-22 21:39:18] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good evening Ms. Campbell,

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey after your recent stay at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. We appreciate your feedback as a World of Hyatt member, and we want to do everything we can to correct or celebrate any successes and areas of opportunity our clientele share with us about their recent experiences. 

In looking over your survey, it appears that we did well during the check-in process and your enjoyment with the condition of the hotel. However, we did not do as well in other areas, particularly with your guest room. Would you be willing to share any additional details as to why the room was not as satisfactory as you would like? Our World of Hyatt member satisfaction is an absolute priority. As such, we would love to know what we can improve on for the future visits of all our arrivals. 

I welcome any additional comments you would be willing to share. Please have a great weekend, Ms. Campbell. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

French toast with cherries, while good, had a lot of kids turned off, including my daughter, who is rather picky, and I paid $12.50 for her to eat danish the 2nd day along with milk, as she didn't like the french toast.  I'm sure that there are other people besides my daughter who would have liked to have their kids eat hot pancakes/waffles vs. danish for $12.50.",,,,,,,5,,"beautiful hotel/conference center, located in the central business district area of Green Bay.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey after your recent stay at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. We appreciate your feedback as a World of Hyatt member, and we want to do everything we can to correct or celebrate any successes and areas of opportunity our clientele share with us about their recent experiences. We have a departmental shared inbox where we receive all of our upsell requests, and I was unable to locate yours in both our actual and deleted folders. On the off chance that  you still have the upgrade offer, would you be able to forward it to my email address below? I would like to share this with our IT department, to identify where the gap in the stream of communication existed in the case of your missed upgrade. 

I am pleased to see that you enjoyed the condition of your room as well as the staff customer service while you were here. We pride ourselves on our service, and I am glad to see we were successful with another happy World of Hyatt member. Were there any additional details (outside of the upgrade not offered at check-in) that resulted in the low check-in score? As we have summer interns at the hotel, we want to make sure we are doing everything we can to successfully develop them. We would welcome any suggestions/feedback you have regarding your arrival experience with one of our colleagues. 

Please respond to this email with any additional information that you would be willing to share. My complete contact information is found below, in the event that you could share that upgrade offer that you received online. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

Good afternoon Stephanie, 

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. Your feedback is very important to us as we use it to continually learn and grow. I see that you rated the overall food and beverage significantly lower than the other areas on the survey, I was wondering if you could provide any further details on where we missed the mark. We would like to use the opportunity to coach and mentor our colleagues to ensure that we are exceeding our guests expectations. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for staying at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our survey and provide us with feedback about your stay. While I’m glad you enjoyed the majority of your stay I want to apologize for the apparent lack of timeliness and presentation with your in room dining meal. While we try to present all our food in a quick and timely manner and presented properly, we seem to have fallen short of your expectations. We will use this as a teaching opportunity. Hopefully, if we have the opportunity to serve you again, we will be able to fulfill your expectations.  If you have any other concerns or comments please feel free to contact me at the email below.
Thank you.

Hello Mr Adams,

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. Our guest feedback is our most important tool and we appreciate your insight. I'm sorry to hear some of our newer staff members may not have been able to fully assist you during your time with us. Any detail you might be able to provide on the specific scenarios where this occurred would certainly be beneficial as we can focus our training efforts in that direction. 

Thank you in advance and we hope to see you back again soon.

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. I'm pleased to see you enjoyed many aspects of your stay with us, including your staff interactions. I'm sorry to hear your room experience was impacted by the smell of cigarette smoke. We are a 100% Smoke Free property and do not allow smoking anywhere in the building. Unfortunately, not all of our guests always follow our policies and we do need to proactively remind them from time to time. In the future, if you ever smell cigarette smoke in your room, please let our front office team know and we will address the issue immediately. We certainly understand the unpleasant nature of cigarette smoke.

We hope to see you back again soon.

2018-06-25 12:23:20] Email received from: ""Mayer, T"" <tmayer@catholiccincinnati.org>: Hi Lucas,
I’d like to better explain my reply.  My wife and I stayed in Room 824, on the east side of the building. Because the drapes aren’t flush to the wall, each morning the room fills with light at 5:30 am. Not very tranquil. I would have like to have had the opportunity to sleep a little later, especially on the day that my first commitment was at 10:30.
I’d also like to address another concern.
My wife lost a set of keys in the hotel the evening before we left. He staff didn’t seem concerned. We reported them missing, they did call security and reported no keys had been found. Fortunately, I had packed a spare key to the car.
We arrived home on Saturday evening and checked everything we had packed, no keys. We call the hotel on Sunday and again asked if a set of keys had been found. We described the keys and where my wife had been in the hotel on Friday evening. I am not sure that the folks on the other end of the line cared. They didn’t offer to take our name or number in case the keys had been found.
The key ring had about eight keys, one Ford car key, several house keys (one in Camo) a few pad lock keys. The key chain had a fob that reads ”Healing”  She returned to the hotel on Friday evening after dinner. She visited the pool area, she may have use the restroom there. She thinks maybe she hung the keys on the back of the stall door.? She also visited the bar/lounge area. She seems to think she set them down in the common area on the first floor.
If you could check on the keys that would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you,
Tim Mayer

Thank you for your response in regards to your room tranquility. We appreciate your feedback and apologize your mornings were impacted in that way.
I just checked with security on your keys and we did have them at this time. According to their records they were found and turned in on the evening of 6/16. I apologize that you felt your earlier inquiries were not taken seriously and I will review the opportunity with our teams. If you would please confirm with me the address  you would like them shipped to, I will get them out as soon as possible and at no charge to you. We will cover the shipping.
Be Well,

I would like to thank you for taking the time to fill out this survey and provide us with your valuable feedback. As we seek to create excellent and precise customer service, detailed responses like yours greatly help us to recover and coach our colleagues in real-time. I would like to also thank you for enrolling with World of Hyatt just prior to your departure. I am not sure who you spoke with, but I assure you that we will make this situation a talking point. Each circumstance and interaction we have with a guest should portray care and empathy, and I am truly sorry that that did not happen in your case. Our team enjoyed hosting the convention that you attended, and we hope that you decide to remember us based on the whole of your stay and not solely the interaction that you had at the front desk.

If you would like to share additional comments about your stay or the incident at the front desk, please reach out to me using the signature below. Do you by chance recall the name of the colleague you spoke with? I do recognize your name, but I am not sure if I am the one that personally assisted you with your keys. I look forward to any additional response or details you may have. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. Your feedback is very important to us as we use it to continually learn and grow. I was disappointed to hear that you did not have an excellent visit to our Pub as we strive to provide quality food and service throughout our hotel.  We will definitely have our engineering team take a look into the toilet, I apologize that it was running during your stay. I do hope that you will stay with us again on your next visit to Green Bay. Also, if you have any further details that you would be willing to share about your visit to Pub 333 please feel free to reach out directly to me. Thank you for staying at Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

Hi Rebecca,
Please do not take this the wrong way: as my wife reminded me, remember where you are at (the Midwest)- so perhaps I should have ordered the mac & cheese and not the sea bass. Even though the service was a tad slow, it came with a smile.
Thanks,
Carlos

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, as we use these throughout the hotel as learning opportunities for our colleagues. From your comments, it appears that you enjoyed your overall stay with us and that you had a good experience here. I was wondering if you would be able to share any further information with me regarding your dining experience; it appears that the service was good, but am curious as to what we could have done to make it exceptional. We are constantly striving to better ourselves and provide exceptional service and food to all of our guests. Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance. Thank you again for staying with us and we look forward to welcoming you back for future visits. 

Sincerely,
Jeni

Hello Ms Koeneman,

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. I'm pleased to hear you enjoyed many aspects of your experience, including your interactions with our team and dining in Pub333. I apologize for the plumbing issue upon your arrival, but I'm happy to hear we were able to resolve the expeditiously. Additionally, we appreciate your feedback regarding our market and I'm thrilled to share we begin a full renovation on that space this summer! At that time, we will be assessing our product offerings and will utilize your feedback during the process.

We hope to see you again soon.

First, I would like to thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey and we use these throughout the hotel as learning opportunities for our colleagues. I would like to apologize for the poor experience you had while dining with us, both at breakfast and in your conference. I will be sharing your comments and concerns, regarding both the allergy concerns and the food quality,  with our culinary team as we strive to always provide quality food and service in all dining areas.

2018-06-17 18:03:35] Email received from: Paula Gwynn Grant <pggrant@bellsouth.net>: Thank you very much for the quick response, Jeni.   I truly appreciate it.  
I also appreciate you using my survey responses to train your staff.  I stay in Hyatts regularly.   My favorite ones are the Hyatt Baltimore Harbor (the food is outstanding) and the Hyatt in downtown Greenville, SC (food is also superb).
Almost all the conferences I attend for business use Marriott hotels.   So this was a big deal to be at a Hyatt. 
I look forward to hopefully returning to Green Bay in the future.

Thank you for providing feedback regarding your recent stay.  I'm glad to hear that you enjoyed the comfort of our rooms and appreciate your comments regarding the lobby and public areas.    Since the hotel was built as an Embassy Suites in the 1980's, the structure of the lobby has brought some challenges in presenting the Hyatt touch our members have grown accustomed to.  Please know that we are in preparation of updating areas of the lobby and market within the year.  Please let me know if there is anything I can assist you with and thank you for staying with us.

Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay.  I am sorry our host seemed confused at check-out when you tried to explain the incorrect parking charges.  I double checked your bill just to make sure you were not over charged.  We always want to ensure accurate billing and did not know your vehicle was only going to be with us for the first night; our system was to provide parking for the entire stay.  I am glad she was able to provide an updated and correct receipt and will explain such possible scenarios with our staff.  For future visits, we can update the parking information on your reservation at any time during your stay.  Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance and thank you for choosing to stay with us.

Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback. I am very glad to see that one of our colleagues stepped in and rose to the occasion to help you; rest assured, he will be commended! We had an experience recently that has allowed us the opportunity to do some re-training and updating on standard operating procedures in the event of technical difficulties, so that has and will continue to be addressed as well. I do apologize for the way you were spoken to and treated, and we will have a conversation with the colleague that was working with the man that helped you. In the event that we cannot provide a guest with an experience that is expected, we want to make sure that the communication is being delivered with sincerity and empathy, as care is one of the driving forces behind everything that Hyatt stands for.

Guest feedback is critical for us to learn and create real life and real-time coaching opportunities so that our colleagues can grow and develop. I will also share your comments with our culinary and food and beverage leadership as well, as we are always working to have cutting edge, modern touches in everything we do. 

We look forward to welcoming you back again in the future. Thank you again for your feedback, and please enjoy the rest of your weekend. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

I wanted to take a moment to thank you for providing feedback regarding your stay and for choosing the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.  I am sorry our beds were not too soft and not to your liking.  Please know that we will begin an installation of new mattresses next month which will provide the firmness you prefer.  If our beds are ever too soft, please let our staff know as we have bed boards that increase firmness.  Our new mattresses should alleviate the tension issue, but I wanted to let you know that we can always try utilizing a bed board for extra firmness.  Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance and I hope you give us another chance by visiting again in the future.  Thank you again for staying with us.

Thank you for taking the time to provide us with this important feedback. We have a very close and important team here, so this will be very valuable as we look for areas where we can build upon and improve things that may have become complacent. I will certainly make sure to have a refreshment conversation with our staff regarding the check-in process; I apologize if our colleague did not give the usual friendly and caring service. We certainly care a lot about all of our guests, especially those from Integrys such as yourself. 

I will speak with our Engineering department to ensure that the comment made about your bed has been followed up with. We appreciate you letting us know so that no one else need be affected by this. 

It appears from your reservation history that you stay here every few months. I hope that you return to us soon so that we can make sure you have a great experience! Please reach out to me should you have any additional comments, Ms. Ninko. Have a fantastic weekend. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. I'm pleased to see you enjoyed many aspects of your stay. We appreciate your concern on the variance in room rates. Generally speaking, room rates can definitely vary on any given day. We frequently adjust rates for specific days based on current room availability and anticipated demand. So, depending on when and how each of your rooms were booked, there could be a difference in the rate. Similar to flight rates and the way airlines adjust. If you have any specific questions or would like to discuss further, I would be happy to reach out directly to look at these details together.

We recently stayed in your establishment (June 9-10, 2018). This is an extremely frequent occurrence for us as we stay there 1-2 times per month. Generally we are very pleased with service and the accommodations themselves. However, during our stay this time we were extremely disappointed and with disgust. When going into our restroom to shower we first noticed hair all over the tub, following that we noticed facial hair all over the bathroom countertop. We went to turn on the shower and the water came spitting out in a yellowish brown color. That was absolutely nasty. Moving on to the main room, we went to make coffee and of course used the sink parallel to the coffee pot and again the water came spitting out of that faucet in a yellowish brown color. This absolutely ruined our morning as we love to sit and enjoy the common room with a cup of hot coffee. Again we generally love this hotel and spend a great deal of money there. We were extremely disappointed and feel as though this occasion needs to be addressed.

Thank you for staying with us again at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. We appreciate your continued loyalty to our hotel. I'm happy to hear you enjoy your visits with us. I also want to apologize for the issues experienced in your room this time. To begin, I am very disappointed to hear of the hair found in multiple locations in your room. This is certainly not a common occurrence and we will review your experience with our housekeeping team as a missed opportunity. In regards to the discolored water, please also accept our apologies as well. We had recently shut down our water system for some routine maintenance. When we turn the water back on after shutting the system down, all faucets tend to have an initial burst of discolored water. Your room must not have been cleared after the maintenance, and I apologized this was missed, as I understand seeing that would be unsettling.

We appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback on your stay. As a token of appreciation, I would be happy to provide complimentary breakfast for your room on your next visit. Please reach out to me directly once your trip is planned.

We do appreciate your response on this matter. We feel as though a complimentary night is what should be provided to us. Like I previously stated we are members and stay at your location once or twice each month resulting in several hundreds even thousands of dollars being spent in your establishment. We would hate to find a new place that will accommodate us as frequently as we are in Green Bay.

Thank you for your response and my apologies for my delayed response. I would be happy to extend an offer of a complimentary night’s return visit to our hotel. To take advantage of this, please reach out to me directly with your stay needs and we can get you set up with a reservation. Please know, the complimentary night would be subject to availability and would not be applicable to high demand dates such as Packer game weekends etc. Otherwise, we look forward to seeing you again soon at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay.  It's wonderful to hear that the reception and wedding day was perfect.  In celebrating such a joyous occasion one would hope for friendly and courteous service.  I'm am disheartened to hear that our staff did emanate a warm welcome, as we pride ourselves for providing excellence in service.  I appreciate your mention of select staff members who left a negative impression on you and will take the opportunity to follow up with their service, especially the mention of your room number.  I will follow up with the entire staff, as that is not acceptable and is noted as an important security precaution during training.  Please feel free to contact me directly should you need any assistance in the future.  I'm so glad that overall your weekend with us was filled with celebration and precious moments of family union.  Thank you so much for staying with us and we hope you think of us again should you decide to have a ""staycation""!

Thanks for the response. I understand the importance of feedback, as my son
also works in the hospitality industry. As much as he loves hearing good
things, the only way to fix the bad is to hear it from the people staying
at the hotel.
Take Care,
Randy

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. We were honored to be a part of your family's special occasion and I'm sorry to hear the bed in your room did not meet your expectations. We know how important a good night's rest is. I am excited to share that in the coming months we will be replacing all of our mattresses in the hotel and look forward to your next stay with us, to try them out. We hope to see you again soon.

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. I am pleased to see you enjoyed your overall stay with us and enjoyed all of your positive comments. We'll be sure to share with the staff. I wanted to touch base on you your comment regarding the outlets next to the bed. We had just updated the media device in all of the rooms with a new product that includes two full outlets and two USB ports. I wanted to make sure that was in your room, which I will double check, and where you were feeling we could use more? We appreciate your feedback as we are always looking to improve.

Hello Ms Vanne,

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. I'm pleased to see you enjoyed your overall stay with us. I did notice that you rated a number of the questions lower at a 5, and was wondering if there were any specific details in your experience in those areas that led you to rate them a little lower. We view our guest feedback as our most important tool, so if there were any opportunities to improve during your time with us, we would love to hear them.

Thank you for staying with us and for spending the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. I am so glad to see that you enjoyed your stay and the customer service experience you received while in the hotel. However, I am very sorry to hear about how the phone call was received. I looked through all of the changes on your reservation, and it was I who added the early check-in request to your room, so I am deeply, deeply sorry if my tone came across as having any type of negative attitude. It is my job as the Assistant Front Office Manager to handle all situations as an example to others, and I sincerely did in no way, shape or form intend to come across wrongly or hang up early. I genuinely appreciate your feedback and will make sure I am conscientious with how I am conducting myself on future calls. I am happy to see that we were able to check you in early at 1:35 PM, and that you enjoyed your guest room. 

Thank you again for your feedback, and for choosing Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I look forward to hopefully welcoming you back again in the future; please enjoy the rest of your week. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

issue, it was a female and I believe her name was Noel or something close
to that. It really wasn’t that she was rude, just felt like I was
inconveniencing her. The whole stay was amazing beyond that. Thank you,
Stacie

Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, especially after a challenging night like you experienced. I apologize that we were not able to connect before you left on Sunday morning. I attempted to contact the owner of the dog after my associate got off the phone with you, but as they were on their way back to the room right around this time (the midnight hour), they unfortunately got there as soon as they could. We are working on making some changes to the way guests and their pets experience the hotel, so please be assured that your comments will not go unheard. 

I am very happy to see that the layout of the rooms was desirable for you and your party and that you enjoyed the beds. I appreciate your loyalty with World of Hyatt, and would like to fully refund the charge that you paid for parking. Could you provide me with the credit card number that was used for the transaction so that we can get started on the refund? I know that it is $18, and I assume it was shortly after 8:51 am when you checked out with one of my colleagues?

I look forward to hearing from you so that we can promptly process your parking refund. Thank you again for the feedback and please enjoy your week. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

Good evening Ms. Koback,
Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to fill out our guest 
satisfaction survey, especially after a challenging night like you 
experienced. I apologize that we were not able to connect before you left on 
Sunday morning. I attempted to contact the owner of the dog after my 
associate got off the phone with you, but as they were on their way back to 
the room right around this time (the midnight hour), they unfortunately got 
there as soon as they could. We are working on making some changes to the 
way guests and their pets experience the hotel, so please be assured that 
your comments will not go unheard.
I am very happy to see that the layout of the rooms was desirable for you 
and your party and that you enjoyed the beds. I appreciate your loyalty with 
World of Hyatt, and would like to fully refund the charge that you paid for 
parking. Could you provide me with the credit card number that was used for 
the transaction so that we can get started on the refund? I know that it is 
$18, and I assume it was shortly after 8:51 am when you checked out with one 
of my colleagues?
I look forward to hearing from you so that we can promptly process your 
parking refund. Thank you again for the feedback and please enjoy your week.
Kind regards,
Matthew

Thank for taking the time to fill out our guest experience survey, these are used throughout the hotel as learning opportunities for our colleagues. I would like to apologize for the way in which you were informed about the bar closing, while the bar did have to close due to business levels, we still want to be courteous to all of our guests. Please be aware that we will be using this as a learning opportunity  to ensure that does not occur in the future. I sincerely hope you had an enjoyable time at the wedding and that you enjoyed the remainder of your stay with us. If I can be of further assistance, please feel free to contact me at the information below. Thank you again for staying with us, and we look forward to welcoming you back.

Thank you for staying with us and for taking the additional time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. I am very sorry to hear that you had a less than flawless stay with us, and have requested that our Engineers take a look at the HVAC and shower in room 630. Any time you are at a Hyatt Hotel & Resort property, feel free to contact the front desk with any concerns or questions that may arise during your stay. Customer service is our business, and we are trained to handle all situations with poise and professionalism. 

With that being said, thank you for informing us about the issues that you experienced in your room. I appreciate the loyalty and feedback from World of Hyatt members such as yourself, and hope to welcome you back again soon. I will make a note in your profile to have a manager ensure that your room is in perfect condition prior to your next arrival at a Hyatt hotel. 

Please have a great week, Mr. Gangone. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

I would like to thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay and for letting us know about having to wait for clear water to run.  I wanted to reach out and let you know that we did have some plumbing serviced prior to your arrival to ensure everything is working properly.  I'm sorry the system flushed brown water through the pipes in your room as a result of this.  Please know it was temporary and everything is back to normal.  I'm glad  you enjoyed your stay overall and we forward to your return this week.  Thank you for choosing to stay with us; it is a pleasure being your home away from home.

I am not sure if the food and drink disappointment was a Hyatt problem.  I think it was whoever made the decision, from our organization, on what to serve during the event.
 Breakfast disappointed me.  I came down a half hour into service and there was barely anything to choose from except pastries and bagels.  Items should be replenished before you were totally out.
I also thought with the box lunch we should have been given a bottle of water.  Once people were seated it was difficult to get to the water in the back of the room.  Very disruptive while the speaker is talking and people are trying to listen.
Thanks for the follow up,
Gina

The waitress called us back a few minutes later & was a bit argumentative with my son-in-law who answered our room phone she insisted that one of us had ordered salmon on our salad. I found this a bit disconcerting.  As the only salmon that was ordered was the entree.  The order was made right, the waitress brought it up to our room and asked for if we still had the salad with the salmon which we did & we returned it to her in the same condition that it was given to us.

Thank you for your feedback and membership with World of Hyatt. In doing our utmost to balance well-being and comfort with preserving our natural resources, we change the linens after every three nights of your stay, just as you mentioned. However we are more than happy to have bed linens and towels changed daily. If you would like this service, we would be more than happy to accommodate. I will add a note in your profile stating that you would like daily linen changes so that this will not be an issue for any future visits. 

I do apologize if we were not able to accommodate airport transportation for you, as our shuttle service is based on availability. The next time you stay with us, feel free to contact us as soon as you have made your travel arrangements; you can schedule as far in advance as you would like. This way we can better ensure that we are taking the best possible care of you and your party. 

Please reach out to me with any additional details about your stay.

Kind regards,
Matthew

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. Your feedback is very important to us as we use it to continually learn and grow. Hyatt chooses to serve Pepsi products throughout all of their hotels, which is why don't carry Coca cola products in our Market.  I'm sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you. Thank you for choosing Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

I would like to thank you for taking time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay.  We thoroughly enjoy the return of the Jehovah Witness convention and want to make sure you have a comfortable stay.  Results of your survey suggest that there was a problem during your stay and/or our staff did not provide the service we are known for at Hyatt.  If you could please elaborate on where we fell short, I would eagerly like to rectify any issues you may have had.  We look forward to this convention every year and I hope you will trust in us to return next year.  Please let me know what I can do for you and thank you for choosing to stay with us!

The third day of my stay housekeeping did not leave any toilet paper and I had to call the front desk for some at around 7:00 at night.

Thank you for being a loyal member with both our hotel and World of Hyatt. We enjoyed having your group here during it's annual convention and I am truly sorry for the less than exceptional guest room attention you received while you were here. Any time you are at a Hyatt Hotel & Resort, please contact the front desk with any concerns that may arise during your stay. I will definitely discuss the response you included in this survey with our housekeeping leadership; not receiving full stay-over care with amenities not being replaced/replenished is absolutely unacceptable. Oftentimes, we have found that guests can forget or accidentally place their privacy sign on their door, but it does not sound like it was this way in your case. 

I look forward to seeing you during your next convention, if not sooner! I will place a note in your profile to make especially certain that your room is treated with VIP service and walked by a manager so that we can ensure there is not another misstep on our part. 

I hope you are having a great weekend; thank you again for your feedback. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback after your less than satisfactory stay. I can imagine how frustrating it must have been to have been spoken to the way you were, at least from what I read in your detailed survey account. Could you tell me any approximate details as to when the Engineer spoke with you? Was it on Friday, Saturday or Sunday, and perhaps a rough time estimate? That would aid us in identifying who spoke with you in this manner. We of course want to use this as a coaching opportunity to develop our colleagues so that a situation (or style of conversation) like this does not happen again. I noticed in the staff interactions section that you mentioned that we were unfriendly. Was this your experience with just the Engineer, or did this happen with the associates at the Front Desk or in other departments of the hotel as well? Customer service and care are the pillars of our purpose at Hyatt Regency Green Bay, and to think that we were being unfriendly as a whole is a perception that we would not want a single guest of ours to have. I will be sure to share your feedback regarding the beverage pricing with our Outlet manager as well, we appreciate your perspective on this matter. As a hotel we our in a very competitive industry, and monitoring trends and pricing is vital to our success from both a product and service standpoint. 

If you could respond and detail any portions of this survey further it would be most appreciated. Our guest feedback is truly one of the biggest driving factors in our short and long-term growth. Thank you so much for your time, I look forward to anything further you would be willing to share. 

Kind regards,

2018-05-29 08:26:30] Email received from: merkatoris@aol.com: Good Morning Mr. Hastreiter,
We stayed at your hotel while visiting Green Bay for our niece's wedding. Although none of the festivities took place at your hotel a block of rooms was reserved at your establishment and several family members stayed here. Originally we planned to just stay Sat. evening but about 5 pm Friday we decided to see if you still had availability for that evening. You did, so we reserved a room. We live in Eau Claire which is a solid 3 hours from Green Bay, while traveling to your hotel, your front desk called to ask if we still planned to check in(call was received at 8:29 per my phone record)? The associate sounded quite irritated that we had not yet checked in and that he was having to call us. We stay in hotels quite often and have never received a similar call!
After arriving at your hotel and realizing the parking situation is a pure nightmare, we were rethinking our hotel choice! The lot was completely full which then pushed us into a ramp down the street. At check in we were told our parking fee was part of our room fee, and we just needed to have our parking ticket validated. So on Saturday morning(about 11am) when we went to get our parking ticket validated and the front desk staff said they couldn't  validate our ticket for the ramp, we were a little displeased! This was again a less then friendly encounter with your staff! It would have been nice on Friday evening when they told us where overflow parking was, to mention that it's not included!
Saturday morning we ate breakfast in the dinning area and had a nice experience with a very pleasant wait staff. 
Our daughter took a shower sometime around 10am Saturday morning. Soon after she was out of the shower we received a loud knocking on our room door(304) a maintenance man was standing at our door with his hands on his hips and said ""did someone in this room just take a shower?"" I replied ""yes"" and he said ""you need to make sure the shower curtains are inside the tub, you caused it to rain in 204!"" I wasn't quite sure how to answer him, his tone and body language made it seem like I needed to go clean up room 204.I did go right to our bathroom when the maintenance man walked off and yes, the outside shower curtains was out of the tub, but the liner and magnet were attached to the inside of the tub!  As a side note, our bathroom fan didn't work. 
We left the hotel around 11 am Saturday morning to run errands and visit family. We returned to the hotel at 2 pm to start getting ready for the wedding and to no surprise to any of us, none of our 3 keys worked. Another trip back to the unfriendly desk!
Sunday morning we again used the buffet breakfast and that is when we were charged $2.50 for a glass of chocolate milk. Saturday morning we didn't receive that charge. When I questioned the wait staff, they said only coffee and juice are included with the buffet. Again, this is WI and $2.50 for a glass of milk is crazy!
I'm sorry we didn't have a Great experience at your hotel! We lived in Green Bay for many years and have many family members still in the area. We generally stay at the Holiday Inn Express on Hoffman Rd. but thought we'd try something different! 
I hope my details of our experience can help you and your staff!
Best of Luck,
Lisa Merkatoris

2018-06-01 21:58:48] Reply Sent: Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Merkatoris. I remember the block of rooms that your family had, and we were happy to have you. I must apologize; I was the person that called you Friday evening. When we are heavily occupied we often call to reconfirm reservations for our late arriving guests, as oftentimes people have double booked or have changed their plans and we simply follow this to ensure that we are taking care of all of our guest reservations. I am extremely sorry that this came off as irritated, and genuinely appreciate your feedback! I would never want a guest to think that I sounded that way, nor would I want to set an example like that for my staff so if it came off that way I am truly sorry and was not in any way irritated.
The situation with both the Engineer and the staff at the Front Desk, specifically the verbiage they used, will be addressed. The ramp is owned by the City of Green Bay, and as such, we cannot provide validation for this. However, between 6 PM Friday night and 6 AM Monday the ramp is free; all that is needed is for persons to retain their ticket and scan it at the exit.
I appreciate the detailed account of your experience very much. I have refunded $50 to the MasterCard on file with your room due to the combination of issues that occurred while you were here. I am truly sorry that you did not have an incredible time with us. I sincerely love what I do and I know that our team will use this as great feedback moving forward with the duration of our wedding (and overall very busy) season here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay.
Kind regards,
Matthew

Thank you for providing us with your feedback over the areas that you scored, in addition to the details on the elevator speed. We are always taking guest feedback into great consideration as we move forward as a property, doing everything we can to enhance and improve the guest experience. Your comment will not go unnoticed as we move along in 2018. 

I hope you had a great weekend and consider staying with us the next time you find yourself in need of lodging in Green Bay. Perhaps at that time we could urge you to consider a membership with World of Hyatt. As a Member, you have a personal profile with Hyatt, so that anywhere you go we can tailor to your needs. For instance, we could consider putting in a low floor request so that you would have a shorter ride on the elevators or perhaps, no ride at all, if it is a property with available rooms on the first floor. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest experience survey, as we use these throughout the hotel as training opportunities for our colleagues. I noticed that overall you seemed to enjoy your time with us, but it appears that we fell short in providing the best experience while you dined with us. We strive to provide exceptional service and quality food to our guests and I would like to apologize for missing the mark when you dined with us. If you would be able to share with me your experience while dining with us, so we may use this as a coaching opportunity for our colleagues so that we may be able to use this as a training opportunity for them to learn and grow. Please feel free to reach out to me, if I can be of any further assistance. Thank you again for staying with us and we look forward to welcoming you back for future visits with us. 

Sincerely,

Thank you for staying with us again this year and for providing us with this feedback about your experience. I will be sure to share the comments regarding late check-out to our sales team to see if there is something we can do to better accommodate runners in future years. Empathy and care are two of our core values, and understanding what our guests are going through and need are critical to our success. I see that check-out times have been an issue from a past survey that you submitted as well, so I hope that we can do something to better work this out in the future. Additionally, I will review with our colleagues at the front desk how they are explaining requests and benefits to our guests. I can see from the survey who checked you in, and that is very unlike this colleague; please accept my sincerest of apologies due to this lack of care regarding our customer service. 

Please reach out to me if you would like to share further details of your stay last weekend. Thank you again for your comments, and please have a great weekend. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

Thank you for your membership with World of Hyatt and the time you took to provide us with our guest survey. I will share your concerns with the rest of the leadership regarding our breakfast and parking prices. Our buffet is a full buffet that includes several items, and we also have an a la carte menu as well with prices differing from the $12.50 buffet price. We provide complimentary coffee in our guest rooms so that our guests can have coffee first thing in the morning at no cost to them, in addition to two bottles of water upon arrival, which is specific to our property; this is not a benefit that is received at all of our hotels. As we have a smaller property compared to many others in our company, we do our best to capitalize on areas where we can exceed expectations and deliver a greater value to our guests. 

Please reach out to me if you would like to discuss any other details from your stay with us. Thank you again for your feedback, and please enjoy the rest of your weekend. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

2018-05-30 13:43:46] Email received from: Ray Birnbaum <zoebot8@gmail.com>: You are proud that for $120/night you give the guests 2 bottles of water
and a small coffee machine in the room. How silly. That brings your service
up to the level of a Days Inn.
I went to the breakfast area the first morning and asked if I could get a
bagel and coffee, rather than the full $12.50 breakfast and was told no.
They suggested I go to your coffee shop and buy something. So you are
delusional if you believe that option exists. And also was told no free
coffee for guests in the lobby. What awful service for an expensive hotel.
Also , the thermostat in my room didn't show the temp on the LED readout,
so I had to guess where to set it.l
My wife is from Wisconsin and she has 2 adult sons, and grown
grandchildren. She has notified her family contact list to never recommend
your hotel.
I didn't research hotels for my trip, but took a friends word to stay at
your hotel.
After now doing research, we have notified the families to recommend the
Hampton Inn down the street from you. There website says:
Free breakfast, free coffee in the lobby and free newspaper, free parking.
It is fairly new and a suite is about $90 night.
Now to compare your  services equal to Hampton , I would have to pay
Hayatt:
1) $30/night more
2) $25/day for breakfast for 2
3) $6/day for coffee for 2 in the lobby in your shop
4) $ 7 day for parking
5) $ 120/day for a room
That is equal to $ 188/day vs $90 for Hampton.
To increase your value , maybe you should offer 3 bottles of water

2018-06-02 14:18:22] Reply Sent: Thank you for the detailed feedback, Mr. Birnbaum. Hyatt Hotels & Resorts has many branded hotels that cater to all types of travelers. Similar to The Hampton, Hyatt has Hyatt Place hotels across the country; unfortunately Green Bay only has a Regency branded hotel. A Hyatt Place would offer free breakfast as part of their limited services, in addition to complimentary parking at most of their hotels from what I have been told by colleagues. (I have not had the opportunity to stay at a Hyatt Place myself yet, but one of my colleagues stays at one during her annual Florida trip and she raves about it every time.)
I certainly understand that not all hotel accommodations are a perfect fit for everyone, and I hope that you will give Hyatt another shot at one of our different brands that would be more in line with the accommodations that you desire; please consider giving Hyatt Hotels & Resorts one more chance in the future.
With all of this being said, our breakfast staff should have honored your request for a bagel and coffee, which would have come out to around $7, and I have already spoken with our Outlet Manager about your specific case so that she can review this with her staff. I am refunding your parking due to this inconvenience during your stay.
I hope you are having a good weekend, Mr. Birnbaum. Thank you again for all of the feedback.

2018-05-25 21:05:02] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good evening Ms. Clark,

Thank you sincerely for filling out our guest satisfaction survey, as your feedback is critical in targeting any areas we have for growth and improvement. I have submitted a request to have the vents from room 803 thoroughly cleaned, and I apologize that you had to be the person to bring this to our  attention. I am sorry to hear that check-out took forever. As a World of Hyatt member, the option for web check-out is always available, and we also have express billing as an option as well, where we could slip a bill under your door on the departing morning to save time. If you would like, I would be more than happy to add that to your preferences; simply respond to this email and I will oblige. Sunday's are always our busiest departure days, and even when we have a colleague on each computer, the departure process has a potential to be challenging if everyone comes down at the same to check-out. Understand that this is our fault, and I apologize for the inconvenience that you experienced. 

I will be sure to share your positive feedback with our culinary and food & beverage departments, as I know they will be happy to hear that the buffet was good. We do have overflow parking available in two areas for future stays, so that if our lot is full we can direct you to one of those two areas. If you have any questions about this, please let me know or inquire the next time you stay with us and one of our colleagues will be pleased to assist. 

Again, I thank you for your time and comments in this survey, and I wish you the best of weekends. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

Good afternoon James, 

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. Your feedback is very important to us as we use it to continue to learn and grow. We strive to provide quality food and service throughout the hotel, and I would like to apologize that we were unable to exceed your expectations this time. Our breakfast buffet does include orange, apple and cranberry juice, coffee or hot tea.  I will be sharing your concerns about the hot food with our culinary team as well as coaching our colleagues on the condition of the food such as the bread on the buffet.  If there are any further details that you wish to provide please feel free to reach out to me at any time. Thank you for staying with us at The Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

It was a pleasure to have an Elite member in-house such as yourself, and I remember personally checking you and your husband in; thank you for taking the time to give us this valuable feedback. I am extremely sorry that you did not receive your two complimentary bottles of water daily, as we work very hard to ensure Elite benefits are properly delivered. I will make certain that this does not happen during your next visit, making note of the fact that it was overlooked on your last stay; I will be removing half of your parking charges due to this inconvenience. It was very kind of you to take the time to explain the high and low points of your stay for us, as our Elite members are truly important to our purpose and mission for success at Hyatt Hotels & Resorts. 

I would encourage you to feel free to contact the Front Desk at any of our properties at the sight of any inconvenience. It is possible that our Engineering department can make sure everything with your HVAC is functioning properly, and a room  move could also be a possible solution if the wind was continuously a problem. We also have fans, space heaters and extra blankets for additional levels of added comfort. We are here 24 hours a day to devise solutions for any of your needs. 

I hope to see you again soon, Mrs. Conner; have a great week. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. We truly appreciate this, as we use it to diagnose how we are doing as far as guest experience, and for areas that we can target for growth and development. It appears from the results that you had a less than perfect stay, in particular, with the check-in process and customer service.  Would you be willing to share any additional details/comments so that we can best learn from this and improve and enhance your next stay with Hyatt Hotels & Resorts? I welcome any additional information you may have, and hope that you enjoy your weekend.

Kind regards,
Matthew

Thank you for your continued loyalty at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am actually the person that checked you in on Monday, as well as the person that has responded to your last two surveys. I would like to personally ensure that you have a perfect experience during your next stay with us. We have clearly underperformed during each of your stays due to a combination of issues, ranging from cleanliness, to air temperature and guest supplies. As previously stated, for your next visit, please reach out to me so that we can prepare for a VIP experience at our hotel. I promise you that we are here to deliver world class service, and I look forward to providing that for you the next time we see each other. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

Noely checked us in, and was a delight to work with throughout our stay.  She did everything she could to make our stay comfortable, enjoyable, and memorable. 

When we arrived, the hotel was almost at full occupancy.  It was obvious that our room had not been rented in a while due to the level of dust on the counters.  With that being said, the hotel was very well kept and attended to, despite having so many people there.

The elevators need to move and set faster.  They are entirely too slow.  I took advantage to the pool area daily, and was surprised at the lack of upkeep during the day.  Guest left garbage and towels on the tables, chairs, floor and even in the pool.  I felt it necessary to clean it up myself.  Saturday night, there were some intoxicated individuals in the pool in their underwear.  One went behind the wall by the hot tub and was vomiting.  I would recommend that someone from management or security make more regular sweeps of the area in order to keep it neat and orderly.

The last thing I would ask is that each room be allowed to have individual control of their HVAC system.  It was too warm in the room.  The heat was on, and the only way to remedy that was to open the window in the bedroom to cool it down.  

We enjoyed your breakfast buffet two of the four days we were there.  The food was phenomenal, and your staff was incredibly nice and attentive.

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. Your feedback is very valuable to us as we use it to coach and mentor our colleagues. I'm sorry that we missed the mark on our customer service. I will be sharing this with the other leaders in the hotel to ensure this type of situation doesn't reoccur, as we strive to provide quality service throughout the hotel. I apologize that your order was incorrect when dining in the pub,  but I am glad that you still enjoyed it.  As for your conference meals,  could you specify what you did not like or what could be improved on, as I will share the information with our culinary team.  



Sincerely,

2018-05-20 11:48:21] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good afternoon Ms. Pelletier,

I would also like to thank you for giving us this feedback. Do you recall the name of the associate who simply told you ""maybe"" upon your request for an early check-in; was it the same woman that processed your check-in? Do you know about how long you had to wait between being given that comment and actually receiving your keys?  It appears that your room was checked in at 8:28 am; this is actually over 6 hours prior to our check-in time, so I am glad to see that our staff was able to accommodate your request very far in advance. Group arrivals can be very delicate, with conference goers often trying to check in before the normal time, and I am thrilled that our staff was able to assist you with this. 

Additionally, while we do not have a bell person on staff, we are always willing to help you with your luggage, should you require assistance. We also prefer our colleagues using an open palm to direct guests as opposed to pointing, and I will be sure to review that with my staff. We are looking at making some big purchases during 2018 and bell carts are one of the items on the list. While we have an ample amount on site, during heavy arrival times it is possible that all were in use and for that I do apologize as well. 

I look forward to hearing any additional details you may have, and sincerely appreciate your loyalty with World of Hyatt. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

Perhaps Hyatt could designate specific rooms for pets. We are not ""animal people,"" and found it unpleasant to have to remove pet hair.
On the plus side, my husband had to park further away because the parking lot was so full. Matthew, the desk clerk on duty Friday night, helped carry our luggage so I could wait for my husband, and offered me a bottle of water.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction. We truly appreciate this, as we use it to diagnose how we are doing as far as guest experience, and for areas that we can target for growth and development. It appears from the results that you had a less than perfect stay, in particular, with the check-in process and remembering your preferences. Are there any preferences that you would like us to remember for your next arrival, so that we can make sure we do a better job in the future? I went back several years and was unable to find any past reservations, and as such, no profile notes. Would you be willing to share any additional details/comments so that we can best learn from this and improve and enhance your next stay with Hyatt Hotels & Resorts? I welcome any additional information you may have, and hope that you are having a great week. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

Good afternoon Mr. Santos,

thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. Your feedback is very important to us as we use it to continually learn and grow. I was wondering if you could let me know what day you dined in the pub for lunch. We do offer a quick service lunch in our market, we have several sandwiches that are made to order as well as a hot special Monday through Friday that includes chips or soup and a drink for only $7.00.  We greatly value your opinions and will use them to coach and mentor our colleagues.

I'm happy to hear that the Hyatt has an express menu. We had a group of
nine on last Thursday. It was not clear that there was a such a thing.  I'll
always ask going forward. I can honestly say that we were not the only
table that did not know about this. I spoke with others in the afternoon
and they had the same issue.  The staff was doing the best that they could.
Our waitstaff forgot a number of beverages the first couple of times. A
manager stopped by and helped us out. Overall, we were pleased with our
lunch. Thanks for the follow-up.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out a detailed guest satisfaction survey. I am certainly saddened to hear that there was a few concerns that you experienced during your stay, and I assure you I will be sharing the results with our housekeepers and engineers so that we can look into your guest rooms and dive into any areas that need to be serviced. Please, at any point during your stay at any Hyatt hotel, please contact the front desk with any concern that may arise. We are here to field any solution necessary from air temperature to guest room condition; we want to make sure that you feel genuinely cared for and are on site 24 hours a day to perform any type of necessary recovery.  

As the Assistant Front Office Manager, I am disappointed to hear that your World of Hyatt membership was not acknowledged, and have spoken with the colleague that processed your arrival, as we always want to make it a specific and special point to acknowledge your loyalty to both our hotel and property; we absolutely value your membership. 

I sincerely appreciate the honest, authentic feedback that you provided us with. Without this information, we would miss out on growing and learning opportunities, and we sincerely thank you for that. If there is anything additional that you would like to discuss about your stay, please feel free to reach out to me using the contact information found below in my signature. I hope you have a great weekend. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

Thank you for your loyalty as a World of Hyatt member, and for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. I am glad to see that you enjoyed the customer service, check-in process, and level of tranquility that you experienced while staying with us. Regarding the age of the hotel, I can personally assure you that we are looking at doing some larger updates and have been discussing more in-depth details in recent weeks; please know that your sentiments are not unheard. 

I see that you ordered from our a la carte menu on a couple of occasions. Would you be able to expand on the confusion over breakfast orders? We have an excellent staff, but want to leave no stone unturned in an effort to perfect the expertise we already have in place. If something was off-center while you were here, we are certainly apologetic and would not want that to happen again. 

I hope you are having a great rest of your weekend, Mr. Chiappetta. I look forward to hearing from you. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

Thank you for reaching out to me. The confusion in the restaurant was over
the orders. I was joined by several members of our staff and all but 1
order was incorrect. Either a side or the way food was asked to be
prepared.
Please be assured your staff was very gracious and, on further review, I
suspect the confusion started from not hearing exactly what was ordered. On
the second day I was sure to repeat what I asked for and received exactly
what I ordered. This did not ruin our stay at all.

Thank you in advance for your time.

Thank you for spending the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, as we truly use these to further develop both our staff and in turn, the guest experience. I processed a maintenance slip so that our Engineering department can take a look further into the issue with the filter and ventilation in your room; thank you for letting us know. I will also share your comments regarding your input on updating our guest rooms to the rest of the leadership here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. 

I noticed that we received a 5 on the check-in score. I do see on your reservation that our Host went ahead to assist you and booked that room for you as our system did not reflect a reservation for you upon arrival and you were without a confirmation number. Do you have any additional feedback you would be willing to share on why we were scored a 5, or perhaps what we as a team could do better next time to receive a higher score? 

Thank you again for your recent business, as well as your comments. I look forward to hearing from you with any additional response you may have; please have a great weekend! 

Kind regards,
Matthew

2018-05-11 06:56:21] Email received from: Richard Jones <yodidogtreats@gmail.com>: Matt, I am not sure if the problem of reserving the room
was at my end or yours. I do recognize that at my age ,63, computers can be challenging.  I do remember having a little computer problems that evening. However I did feel that the web site was not as straight forward as it could have been. When I arrived the check in clerk was wonderful I was a bit irritated that the reservation had not gone through. I enjoyed my stay  and will certainly stay at Hyatt again.

2018-05-08 20:15:38] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good evening Ms. Garber,

Thank you for providing us with your feedback as a World of Hyatt member, we certainly appreciate your loyalty. I am glad to hear that you enjoyed the room and amenities at the rate that you paid, but as the Assistant Front Office Manager am disappointed to read that our staff was not friendly or personable. Would you be able to provide any further specifics on this? Was it isolated to just your arrival and departure, or did you have further experiences with our staff at the desk? I am glad to see that we were helpful and served you with expertise, however the authentic and hospitable level of customer service that we are branded on was apparently lacking and I would like to know any further details or suggestions you may have so that we can best learn from this experience. 

Additionally, would you like to be placed on lower floors, closer to a stairwell perhaps so that in the future you could have a quicker, second option available to you? I completely understand the frustration that a slow elevator can create, and I assure you that we are constantly talking about ways that we can improve and enhance our guest experience amongst the leadership at the hotel. 

I truly appreciate your feedback, and hope to hear back from you. I hope this message finds you amidst a good week. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay.  I like the suggestion of providing treats, especially for adolescent groups that stay the weekend.  I'm not sure if your comment was for having them in the lobby or in the room but it would be a nice touch for groups such as yours.  I am sorry the rooms are on the small side, since the hotel was built almost thirty years ago.  I do appreciate the extra counter space of the wet bar but I do understand that it is not the same.  Please know that we do have some rates that include our breakfast buffet, but your group did not have it contracted in the rate and continental breakfast is unavailable since we do serve a buffet.  I appreciate your comments and hope you are able to visit us again.  Please let me know if you should ever need any assistance.

2018-05-08 20:06:17] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good evening Ms. Rhodes,

Thank you for staying with us over the weekend, and for spending the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey as we look to gather feedback in all aspects from the perspective of our guests. I hope that you and everyone else had a beautiful time at the wedding. I will certainly pass along your comments regarding the heating and cooling situation at our next Operations meeting, and completely understand the frustration that this can create. I am not sure if you reached out to us regarding the room temperature, as there are a few things that we can do to improve the quality of your room temperature so that it is a more comfortable setting. If at any time in the future you experience any type of concern or issue during a stay at a Hyatt Hotels & Resorts property, please contact the Front Desk so that we can best assist you. The two complimentary bottles of water that you found in your room are actually for the initial arrival day only, they are not refreshed on a daily basis, but are always available for purchase at The Market, located across from the Front Desk, open 24 hours a day. 

I hope that this message finds you in the middle of a good week. Please reach out to me directly if you have any additional comments or feedback that you would like to share so that we can collaborate with our teams. 

Best regards,
Matthew

Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay; I hope you enjoyed the competition and I have happy to hear you enjoyed your previous stay with us.  I am sorry there was frustration regarding the multiple rates that others had in comparison to yours.  The contracted group rate will often have special inclusions such as parking and will not be the same as our fluctuating daily rate.  Please feel free to contact me directly should you need assistance in making future reservations.  I am sorry there was a change in the thickness of crust within the short gap of time between your reservations.  Your comments will be passed on to our chef, as the thin crust seemed to trial test.  I apologize for them not mentioning it or asking for a preference.  Once again, please feel free to contact me should you need assistance and thank you for choosing to stay with us.  We thoroughly enjoyed having the dance competition here this weekend.

Greetings Ms. Thao,

I am so glad you enjoyed your stay throughout the hotel.  I just wanted to let you know that I was very much looking forward to seeing you and your nieces during checkout.  I truly missed her singing and wish I would have ran into you on Sunday.  I hope you are able to visit us again!  Thank you for brightening my day and for choosing to stay with us.

Hello Ms Kennedy,

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. We are thrilled that you enjoyed many aspects of your stay with us, including the rooms and your room location.  I'm terribly sorry to hear your arrival was hectic and that your car was damaged during that process. I also apologize that any of our staff came across as anything but accommodating and happy to have you join us in our restaurant for breakfast. We will definitely review the situation with our team as a learning opportunity to make sure that doesn't happen again. If there's anything else I can do for you or assist with in regards to your vehicle damage, please let me know.


Sincerely,

Lucas Boie

As an Assistant Manager at the Front Desk, I can personally guarantee that 100/100 phone calls are all equally important, and the more we know, the more we can work with. Please do not ever feel that you cannot come to us due to any concern that you may experience; we are here to set it right and deliver a world class experience. I will be sure to share your positive comments with our front desk and culinary staff. 

Again, I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences that you incurred while staying with us. I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for the follow up.  The shelving unit was right outside the bathroom.  I was in Room 729 and I can still explain the room to you.  When I walked in, I noticed a small piece of paper by the cabinets/stools.  I thought I would leave it there as an experiment - would it be vacuumed up the next day?  It was not.  Once you get past the living area, you entered the bedroom and to the right of the doorway there was an open closet with two shelves - one shelf above the hangars and the other at about knee height.  The lower shelf had a box with a blanket in it resting on the shelf - I moved this to the floor under the lower shelf and placed my suitcase on the lower shelf.  If you turn to the left, you would enter the bathroom and it didn't appear as though the sink was cleaned well.
Anyway, as I noted in my comments, I usually have wipes with me and I used a wipe to take one pass through the lower shelf once I noticed the substance on the bags I had with me.  In one pass, the wipe was excessively filthy (as you can see from the attached picture).  Quite frankly, I was disgusted and disappointed all at the same time.  It's one thing to have a dusty room; it is quite another to be in a filthy room.
One other thing that bothered me that I may have forgot to mention is this: no matter where I stay, I usually put the bed together after a night's sleep but house cleaning will come in and ""make it shine.""  That is, they will tidy up the bed, fold down the sheets, fluff the pillows, etc.  That never happened during my stay.  Perhaps this is your policy but, from my perspective, it is the attention to detail that matters in anything a business or entity does or performs.  I'm sorry to say I didn't witness that in my stay.

When I walked in, I noticed a small piece of paper by the cabinets/stools.  I thought I would leave it there as an experiment - would it be vacuumed up the next day?  It was not.  Once you get past the living area, you entered the bedroom and to the right of the doorway there was an open closet with two shelves - one shelf above the hangars and the other at about knee height.  The lower shelf had a box with a blanket in it resting on the shelf - I moved this to the floor under the lower shelf and placed my suitcase on the lower shelf.  If you turn to the left, you would enter the bathroom and it didn't appear as though the sink was cleaned well.
Anyway, as I noted in my comments, I usually have wipes with me and I used a wipe to take one pass through the lower shelf once I noticed the substance on the bags I had with me.  In one pass, the wipe was excessively filthy (as you can see from the attached picture).  Quite frankly, I was disgusted and disappointed all at the same time.  It's one thing to have a dusty room; it is quite another to be in a filthy room.
One other thing that bothered me that I may have forgot to mention is this: no matter where I stay, I usually put the bed together after a night's sleep but house cleaning will come in and ""make it shine.""  That is, they will tidy up the bed, fold down the sheets, fluff the pillows, etc.  That never happened during my stay.  Perhaps this is your policy but, from my perspective, it is the attention to detail that matters in anything a business or entity does or performs.  I'm sorry to say I didn't witness that in my stay.
Respectfully submitted,
Scott

Subject: Your recent stay at Hyatt Regency Green Bay
Good evening Mr. Brandmeier,
I would like to personally thank you for the detailed comments that you have provided us with during your stay. I only wish that for both of our sakes we would have had more in the positive area as opposed to the opposite. I assure you that there are dozens and dozens of dedicated individuals that want nothing more than to deliver a complete Hyatt experience to everyone who walks through our doors, and I apologize that you did not receive this treatment. We are working closely with our Housekeeping staff to ensure that situations such as yours do not repeat themselves, as we of course want all of our rooms to be free from debris on the floor, as well as liquid substances on any shelves. Please forward along your pictures, so that we can see if the issue was in the bedroom or living room areas. Please know that any time you stay at a Hyatt hotel, our staff is here 24 hours a day to take care of and provide solutions for, anything that can arise. As an Assistant Manager at the Front Desk, I can personally guarantee that 100/100 phone calls are all equally important, and the more we know, the more we can work with. Please do not ever feel that you cannot come to us due to any concern that you may experience; we are here to set it right and deliver a world class experience. I will be sure to share your positive comments with our front desk and culinary staff. 
Again, I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences that you incurred while staying with us. I look forward to hearing from you. 
Sincerely,
Matthew

Dear Mr. Pelliccia,

Thank you for sharing your need for foam pillows.  There was no notation on your reservation for non-feather pillows.  I have added notes to your membership profile to ensure you receive a room set up properly prior to your arrival.  As we did have an abnormal amount of requests for extra foam pillows, we did have to go off property to purchase more.  I hope you received the pillows you needed.   Please feel free to contact me directly should you need any assistance in the future and thank you for staying with us at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.  I hope you have fun at the wedding.

Warm Regards,

Kristin Cordeiro

Dear Ms. Sauer,

Thank you for sharing your experience.  I understand there was little to do to change the circumstance but to apologize and offer compensation of room rate and late checkout.  I appreciate your feedback and want you to know that you can contact me directly for assistance should you wish to enjoy taking the kids to our pool facilities.  I have added a note to your profile for a thorough inspection prior to your arrival to ensure you have a pleasant stay with us.

Thank you for writing us about your concern for layout of your room not including a window; they have been forwarded to our leadership team.  Please know that all other rooms with that layout do have windows and I have made a note to your profile to not assign you to this specific room in the future.  I hope you will give us a second chance should you find yourself back in Green Bay and please feel free to contact me directly for assistance.  We enjoyed having you here and hope to see you again!

Hello Ms Connell,

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. I'm pleased to see you rated many aspects of your stay high and enjoyed staying with us overall. I also see that you rated the ""staff sincerely cared"" category a little lower and was wondering if there was anything specific that led you to feel that way. We are always looking to  improve and any further insight into your stay would be valued.

Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay and for choosing to stay with us.   I am sorry that children were not as well watched by their attending adults as one would expect, and that the height of our toilets were not to your liking.  We do encourage quiet hours starting at 10pm nightly and have staff to respond to any complaints of noise throughout the night.  I hope this stay of abnormal adolescent attendance does not deter you from returning.  Please feel free to contact me directly for future assistance, should you find yourself looking to stay in Green Bay.

Good Evening Brian, 

Thank you for taking our guest satisfaction survey. Your feedback is very important to us as we use it to continually learn and grow. I'm glad that overall you enjoyed your stay. I was wondering what type of options you would have liked to see on our menu in Pub 333. I'm sorry that you thought the food was poor quality, may I ask what you had when you dined with us? We do try to stay competitive with our pricing and selection. I would love to hear any food options that you would like to see on our menu and I hope that you will give us another chance! Please feel free to reach out to me personally to discuss your anything about your stay. Thank you for staying at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

2018-05-03 18:18:08] Email received from: Brian Zenefski <brewwolfone@mail.com>: &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dear Rebecca: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am pleased that you found my satisfaction survey important enough to reply to me. So many times I think these surveys&nbsp;are over looked to the point where most times I will not even respond to them. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With this said you did contact a person in myself that says what's on his mind no matter what it may pertain to or who it may be said to. I have always believed that to be honest with people is always the best way to be in proceeding forward.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As you may be aware the Packer Chapter has stayed at your hotel the last several years for our annual Trade A Thon convention. I am also on the board of directors for the Packer Chapter so there are times through out the year that the board will have their monthly meetings which many times are held in the 333 pub.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We as a group are satisfied with the hotel itself that&nbsp;we are locked in for the next 3 years. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As far as the Hyatt itself, I as well as the group have enjoyed staying there these past several years. The rooms are neat and clean. They don't smell as some sleeping establishments do. The linens and towels are fresh and in good condition. The room wait staff are very accommodating and pleasant. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As far as the Hyatt&nbsp;the only complaint I have heard is about the elevators being extremely slow. This is out of your control and all I can figure is when they went out for bids when the place was built this particular elevator company must have bought the best steak in negotiations. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will give you a little background on myself before I address the concerns on the 333 pub. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I turned 63 this past February. Unfortunately because of being exposed to certain hazards in the work place I was forced into disability&nbsp;retirement in my later 50's. I have a lung disease called sarcoidosis that unfortunately in my case has moved to my heart. I have a pace maker and&nbsp;I have had&nbsp; heart stents installed.&nbsp;I've had a heart ablation as well as a few other issues. Because of this when I arrived at the Hyatt on Thursday night&nbsp;I got a handicap stall close to the door.&nbsp;I did not move the car until I left on Sunday because I knew I would not get another stall in the parking lot if I were to move.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With my not being able to walk even to Hagermeister Park and not wanting to move the car I am forced to eat on premise.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Both myself and my room mate had the Hyatt breakfast buffet on Friday morning. We were both disappointed in this. My room mate to the point he would not even consider it on Saturday morning. I had it Saturday and was pleased with it outside of the what I think was oatmeal. It looked something like oatmeal but did not taste like oatmeal. It kind of resembled some kind of gravy with out the grease. The omlet man was very good. I also enjoyed the fresh fruit. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Friday&nbsp;because of trade hall hours my roommate and I had to eat separately. We both ate in the 333. My friend ordered a rare steak that he said came out raw with an excessive amount of grisl and fat. Definitely not worth the $28.00 I think he said it cost. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I had a turkey club that was basically flavorless. The turkey used was terrible. Any Subway would have been much better at half the price. I also wish they had tator tots or something beside the boring french fries or sweet potato fries. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Saturday night we both went back into the 333 pub although it was about a half hour&nbsp; between our arrivals. My friend ordered the shredded pulled pork with fries. It was not shredded and was tough. I ordered the same thing. Mine was shredded but tough and not of a good flavor. I had the sweet potato fries which were fair. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were both completely dissatisfied with&nbsp; the overall food offering. We both felt ripped off and we both felt a Burger King would have been a better offering. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We both felt we would not go back and we both left the next morning feeling any place along the way home would have better choices that definitely tasted better at a much more affordable price. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When speaking with attendee's of our convention the general feeling was negative as far as the 333 pub. I feel as high class of a place the Hyatt is suppose to be the restaurant they have chosen to be on premise is just dragging them down. A family style restaurant would be a lot better. I know for a fact I will not eat there again and when I do stay at the Hyatt next year I will bring my own food. It got to the point I was just wishing the convention would end so I could get a good meal because I wasn't going to get it out of the 333 Pub. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hell I could go to Golden Corral as we did Thursday night before 4 and eat everything for $11.02 before 4pm. Salad bar, steak and so on. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you do have trouble with reading this as I have been having some computer issues please feel free to call me anytime. All I ask is that you ID yourself right away so I don't think it is a pushy telemarketer and hang up on you. My phone is 920-720-9380 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I do hope this clears up some of your concerns regarding the 333 Pub. I think of it now and just lose my appetite. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Brian Zenefski &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  Sent:&nbsp;Wednesday, May 02, 2018 at 6:45 PM

 Good Evening Brian,
 
 Thank you for taking our guest satisfaction survey. Your feedback is very important to us as we use it to continually learn and grow. I'm glad that overall you enjoyed your stay. I was wondering what type of options you would have liked to see on our menu in Pub 333. I'm sorry that you thought the food was poor quality, may I ask what you had when you dined with us? We do try to stay competitive with our pricing and selection. I would love to hear any food options that you would like to see on our menu and I hope that you will give us another chance! Please feel free to reach out to me personally to discuss your anything about your stay. Thank you for staying at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay!

Thank you for taking the opportunity to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. I do apologize for the wait on your folio. I was the gentleman that checked you out, and I did go through your reservation history and it is noted that the folio was emailed successfully. Sometimes these can be found in spam or junk folders. To alleviate any further delay, I will send you a separate email from my personal account with your folio attached. 

Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to assist you; we were so glad to host your group again in 2018 and look forward to seeing you again soon. 

Kind regards,
Matthew

I am sorry to hear that there was a noise that was bothering you during your stay; we would have gladly changed your room for you.  I have made note for future stays for a quiet room that is away from the corner you were in, as you had mentioned it sounded mechanical and not coming from outside.  I have also refunded the first night's room & tax for the lack of sleep you experienced.  Please feel free to contact me directly for anything you may need, and thank for staying with us at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

Hello Mr Rudahl,

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. I'm thrilled to hear you enjoyed all of your interactions with our staff and appreciate our Conserve Program in the guest rooms. I apologize that your bed did not get made up on your second day with us. You are correct, that is not a part of the conserve program and is a standard as part of our stay-over service. Generally speaking, the only reason we wouldn't go into the room to perform a stayover service would be if there was a Privacy Please sign on the door. We will make sure to review our procedures with our team and we  hope to see you back again soon.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, as these are used as training opportunities for our colleagues throughout the hotel.

Hello Mr Stormer,

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. We appreciate your feedback and we completely understand your frustration with your arrival experience. Please be assured that this is not the kind of experience we want for any of our guests and the fact that this happened on the Sunday of your arrival had absolutely nothing to do with the group, or the age of its attendees. We feel honored, and regard it as a privilege to host the WASC JAM conference. I'm not going to take time to make excuses as to why it happened. The fact of the matter is, that this shouldn't have happened. We had hoped to communicate this sentiment through some of our senior leadership members speaking to the entire group on Monday morning. By inviting anyone to discuss Sundays events with us, should they wish, we had hoped for the opportunity to make it right for those affected. We wish you had stopped by, because we certainly do want to make things right.  Again, I completely understand your frustration and disappointment.

For those groups and rooms affected by the very late check in time, we have offered 50% off of the room rate for the night. If you have a moment, please send me the name registered to each of your rooms along with the school district you were with, and I can begin processing those adjustments and refund.

I look forward to hearing from you further.


Sincerely,

Lucas Boie

We attended the sessions Monday morning and therefore didn’t have time to stop by but told the students that even as adults we have to apologize some times and how it shows great leadership and courage to get up in front of all of us and admit a mistake happened. For that, we do thank you.  Let us know if you need anything further to process our refund. Thank you for your time.

I would like to thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay.  It was unfortunate and embarrassing that we were unable to have all of our rooms cleaned by check-in time.  Our staff is very appreciative of the responses we have received from advisers on how we handled our apologies to all, especially the students.  We enjoyed having the WASC conference with us and look forward to providing better service this weekend.  I am sorry that we either forgot about the bottled water in your room or ran out; either way, there should have been communication and timely follow up.  I hope you will stay with us again when your plans bring you to Green Bay.   The energy in the lobby from the students was rejuvenating and we felt honored to have the group with us.  Thank you for your inspiring words, as leadership in many forms was displayed throughout the group's stay.  Thank you for staying wish us!

I agree that the reservation process was confusing and clumsy.  Although we tried our best to keep people together and assign groups next to each, we unfortunately did not have a room list to work off of.  I even tried to pull a group list sorted by City to try to find people who should be together, but alas the system could not filter the search.  This learning curve will be fixed for future conferences and has been noted by our booking staff, as the only way for us to know who was together was by reservations made under the same name.  We appreciate all of the understanding we received from both adults and students during your stay.  I'm glad you enjoyed the rooms; please feel free to contact me directly for any assistance in making sure your reservations are grouped accordingly in the future.  Thank you so much for staying with us; it was wonderful to have your group with us.

Thank you for taking time to provide feedback regarding your stay.  I am sorry to hear you felt we were not concerned about our room availability.  It was all we could focus on and there was only so much we could say when the amount of clean rooms remained lean.  It was difficult to have rooms ready for some while so many others waited, and all the while not knowing when the rest of the rooms would be ready for so many grouped pre-assigned rooms.  The experience was embarrassing on our end and many us were at a loss of words by the end of the night.  Your group should not have had to wait so long and we appreciated the opportunity to express our apologies on Monday.  I hope this high volume rush does not deter you from allowing us to provide the service you deserve in the future.  Please feel free to reach out to me directly should you need any assistance and thank you for staying with us.

I would like to thank you for taking the time to fill out our survey.  I understand there were multiple factors from you stay that would warrant your ratings, especially the availability your entire group experienced with delayed check-in.  Our staff was at a loss, as we could not keep up with making rooms available quick enough.  I would like to apologize for the affect it had on your stay and hope you will give us another chance to extend our hospitality should you find yourself in Green Bay in the future.  Please feel free to contact me directly for any assistance you may need.  I hope you enjoyed the conference, as we truly appreciated having you here.

2018-04-24 18:48:47] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good evening Ms. Hoffman,

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest survey. Top level customer service is extremely important at our hotel, so I am very pleased to read that our Pub333 staff took care and provided you with great, attentive service. However, I must apologize if you were not received with a friendly disposition upon arrival. I noticed that you used our web check-in, but was able to see who added your parking charges. With that being said, I am fairly certain as to who checked you in, and I can use this as an opportunity to coach our colleague and use this as a learning opportunity for future arrivals. 

Additionally, if at any time you experience any discomfort during a stay at any Hyatt hotel, please contact the Front Desk from your guest room phone so that we can promptly work towards resolving any situation at hand. I am truly sorry that you were inconvenienced with a room temperature that was definitely not where you desired it to be. I assure you that our staff is ready to take care of you at any of our locations, 24 hours a day. If you have any further questions or feedback regarding this issue, please reach out to me directly as my contact information can be found below in my signature. 

Thank you again for staying with us and for the constructive feedback, Ms. Hoffman. Please enjoy the rest of your week. 

Kind regards,

Matthew

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. I'm pleased to see you enjoyed many aspects of your stay and appreciate the direct feedback on a few others. I'm sorry to hear of your experience parking in the public ramp. The safety of our guests is of utmost concern and priority to us. While we have never had an incident in the past, I completely understand the discomfort in this situation. Please know that I will review with our Front Desk Team to make sure we are recognizing when we have the opportunity to offer service and/or assistance. For instance, in the case of two women returning to the ramp later at night,  we could offer one of our security team members to meet you over there and escort you back. Additionally, I apologize for the noise disturbance. Our Security team works hard to address before and as these issues arise but this is another example I will review with the team to identify opportunities we have to do better.

Our guest feedback is our most valuable tool and we appreciate your insight.

We hope to see you back again soon.

Hello Syed Faruque,

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. I'm happy to see that you enjoyed many aspects of your stay and had a great night's rest on our beds. Our guest feedback is our most important tool and we appreciate you providing  your insight on the furniture and parking charges. We will certainly take it into consideration as we move forward. I hope you are able to enjoy our pool facilities on your next visit! 

Sincerely,

Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay and for choosing to stay with us at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.  I am sorry there was a mishap with  your initial set of keys to the room, but am pleased to know the issue was resolved quickly.  I'm glad you hear that you enjoyed your stay even with the pool being cool.  Although it would take time to adjust, we do have staff who can try to get the temperature changed to your liking.  I hope you are able to visit us again and enjoy our facilities.  Please let me know if there is anything I can do for you and feel free to contact me directly should you need any assistance.

Thank you for the email.  That is very impressive that you reach out to
past guests!!  I am hoping to be able to buy some packer tickets this year
and will definently consider staying at the Hyatt!  Do you require a 2

Thanks
Matt

I’m hoping to go to a game too! Yes, we do require a two night stay and all reservations during the season weekends are full prepaid non fundamental. I hope you have a good weekend!

I appreciate the time you took to fill out our guest survey, as it is one of the best tools we have to locate areas of both success and opportunity within our hotel. I will tell you that I have submitted a ticket for our Engineering department to take a look at the flooring in room 321 immediately. 

I noticed that we could have done better in several areas on your scorecard, especially in sections regarding our staff and the level of service that we provided. Would you be willing to expand on any reasons as to why we weren't able to do better? We are all constantly learning and would sincerely appreciate any additional feedback that you would be willing to share. Additionally, as a World of Hyatt member, you are in a position to give us any information that you have regarding your personal preferences, so that we can best prepare for any future arrivals that you may have at either our property or any Hyatt worldwide. Do you have any room, food and beverage, or other preferences that you would like us to remember for your next visit? 

Thank you for being a loyal World of Hyatt member, Mr. Kinjerski. Please enjoy the rest of your week. 

Kind regards,

Matthew

Thank you for providing us with this feedback. I sincerely appreciate the kind comments regarding our staff, and I assure you that the relationship that our hotel has with your company is extremely important. I will be sharing your thoughts regarding the HVAC with my colleagues, as we are constantly looking for ways to best serve our guests amidst season changing climate issues, and how the HVAC system works as an integral part of that process. 

We appreciate both your comments and loyal business. Please reach out to me if there is anything else you would like to share regarding your experience at our facility, and enjoy the rest of your week. 

Kind regards,

Matthew

Thank you so much for the praise you have given our staff. I can tell you personally that it was one of the most rewarding weekends of my career to work, and it was a pleasure to read that in spite of the conditions that we were able to provide great, caring and authentic service. I would also like to apologize. As one of the managers on duty, and the attending Front Desk manager, I can tell you that it was my fault that your room was not followed up on. My colleague did enter a note that she had spoken with you and I see that we in fact did not follow up with you, as you had imagined. 

I see that you mentioned that you will be looking to stay here in the future, and I can tell you that while we look forward to welcoming any guest or member back, we would especially look forward to welcoming back someone that stayed during the April snowfall of 2018. When you do book, please reach out to me personally so that we can make it a memorable experience. I would like to get you in to one of our upper floor rooms and give you a complimentary upgrade the next time you stay with us. Simply mention my name and retain this email so that we can go above and beyond, one more time. 

I hope you have a great weekend, and again, thank you so much for the kind words, it truly means the world to our staff. 

Kind regards,

Matthew

We brought our dog with us, and the staff even remembered her name throughout the weekend. She is diabetic and unable to eat regular dog food. The kitchen staff cooked her some food so we would have enough to get through our extra time there. 

I have Celiac disease and the kitchen/wait staff were so on top of things- making sure everything was gluten free. Even when it was insanely busy after the competition each night and the food choices were limited, they found something for me to eat! I didn’t get sick all weekend! 

The housekeeping staff did a great job taking care of our room, and I will apologize again for my daughter making such a huge mess with the glitter. :)

We were stranded there due to the snow and every single staff person worked day and night to make sure we had a good experience-even when they weren’t able to go home because of the weather.

We brought our dog with us, and the staff even remembered her name throughout the weekend. She is diabetic and unable to eat regular dog food. The kitchen staff cooked her some food so we would have enough to get through our extra time there. 

I have Celiac disease and the kitchen/wait staff were so on top of things- making sure everything was gluten free. Even when it was insanely busy after the competition each night and the food choices were limited, they found something for me to eat! I didn’t get sick all weekend! 

The housekeeping staff did a great job taking care of our room, and I will apologize again for my daughter making such a huge mess with the glitter. :) 

The woman in the Market knew my chai order by the second day, and was so kind!

Hello Ms Ding,

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. I'm sorry to see that you left feeling your overall experience was lacking. Our guests feedback is our greatest tool, and I'm wondering if there were any specific details you might be willing to share that led you to score us a 6 overall? 

Thank you in advance for your time.

2018-04-20 13:31:22] Email received from: Florence Lee <psklee@aol.com>: Hi,
I have always enjoyed staying at the Hyatt hotels. Customer service at the front desk of this location is excellent. Very helpful and prompt. 
The hotel room here was less than what I usually experienced at other Hyatt hotels. There was no bathroom exhaust fan. That’s a huge negative. And the bedroom felt stuffy and stale. There was also no fan to circulate the air in the room. 
Because the quality of my stay is a large part driven by the quality of the room, I gave it a moderate rating.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Florence Ding

Thank you for spending the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey; we truly value your feedback as a loyal World of Hyatt member. I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences you experienced with the room temperature while you were on-site. As such, I will be requesting some compensatory points to be distributed in to your World of Hyatt account. Room temperature and tranquility of stay go hand in hand, and I can imagine that this was very frustrating as you were spending five nights with us. I am disappointed that we didn't follow up with you more on the issue, and I am sorry for that. 

Please monitor your World of Hyatt account for the award I spoke about earlier. We value the membership you carry with us, and would like you to be able to do something nice for yourself due to this inconvenience a few weeks back. 

If you have any additional comments, please reach out to me directly so that we can continue to work with and develop our colleagues and our hotel for the next incoming guest. Please enjoy your weekend, Mrs. Richter. 

Kind regards,

Matthew

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest survey. I appreciate your feedback, and sincerely apologize for the combination of issues that occurred during your time at our property. I was working the night you arrived, and personally remember the line that you had to wait through. We were hoping to have another colleague on duty that evening, but that outcome was unfortunately not reached. 

Please feel free to always contact us at anytime regarding any issues you experience while you are at a Hyatt hotel. We are on duty 24 hours, and if we cannot send a housekeeper up, we will provide you with a solution to resolve any problem. Regarding your billing, you are correct that there was an authorization in the amount $150.90, as all arrivals have an additional $25 authorized for security purposes. However, the final amount billed to your credit card was only $100.90. The bill, originally $125.90, was reduced down to $100.90, as it looks like my colleague placed a credit on your room due to the experience you were already having. 

The next time you stay with us, please feel free to contact the Front Desk prior to your arrival, in the morning if possible, requesting a pre-registered early check-in. If it is available on that day, we can alleviate any issues you may have so that you can have a smooth, efficient check-in process. 

Again, I apologize for the issues you had during your stay. If you have any further comments or feedback, please feel free to contact me using any of the methods in my signature. Enjoy your weekend, Mr. Dawood. 

Kind regards,

Matthew

I'm pleased to see that you enjoyed most of your stay with us but apologize for the noise disturbance on your last night. I would be happy to call and discuss the circumstances to gain a better understanding of where could have done a better job responding.

Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay.  Although a 24-hour notice for an early departure is our standard cancellation period on all reservations, your group had many changes to departures dates which was understandable and one of common sense.  We appreciated any advance notice given by people who changed their travel plans, but it was not necessary for the teams' circumstances when leaving within a reasonable hour of checkout time to avoid being charged for another night.  I know a lot of people cancelled the last night of reservations, as they were departing on Sunday instead of Monday.   I apologize for any grief given in trying to leave early, as making such arrangements with airlines and car rentals as well turns into quite the hassle. I double checked your bill to make sure you were not charged for Sunday night.  Once again, I am truly sorry the process did not go smooth and effortlessly.  Please  feel free to reach out to me should you need any assistance.

2018-04-12 06:25:52] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Dear Ms. Huck,

I would like to apologize for the poor communication and customer service you received during your stay.  The gesture of night out for your anniversary was a wonderful and thoughtful gift from your mother-in-law.  I am sorry she didn't know of credit card authorization standards on non-prepaid reservations.  I feel a lot of confusion would have been alleviated if we could have had the billing set up correctly prior to your arrival; it's unfortunate you had to waste time  to deal with the process of fixing it.  Since her card was not approved for charges until after your card was used during check-in, your card was processed, but please rest assured that we have reversed the charges and you should see that reflected with your bank shortly.  In trying to make up for the rowdy behavior of other guests, I know Amanda felt you deserved compensation and she wanted to make sure it was directed to you for the poor experience.  I understand her expression of intent did not come out the way she had meant and she feels horrible for having upset you.  Although she took $50 off of your bill, I would like to invite you back for a chance to redeem ourselves of service I know of which we are better.  If you are willing, I would like to enroll you in our World of Hyatt program and place 5K points in the account which can be redeemed for a future free night stay.  Please let me know if this is something you are interested in and I will make sure you are taken care on your next visit.

Mr Rhodes,

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. I'm pleased to see you enjoyed your check in process as well as the fruit selection available at breakfast. I'm sorry to see we were not able to meet expectations in other areas of your stay and appreciate your feedback and insight. I apologize that your mattress did not provide you with anything less than a great night's sleep and apologize for the issues experienced in the restaurant. Our guest feedback is our most valuable tool and we will utilize yours to share with the appropriate teams to learn and improve.

We hope to see you back again in the future.

It is so exciting to hear that you have been staying at this property all these years, and what a transition is has been over time!  I know your wife said she loves coming here year after year.  As usual, we do have a breakfast buffet available and can be found included in some rates.  Unfortunately, the breakfast package cannot accompany the government rate.  I am sorry that the surprise was ruined for the closeness of your room to your father's.  Rest assured, I will take great care of you the next time you come to our property.  Please contact me directly so I may anticipate  your arrival.  Thank you again for continuing to choose to stay at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay; I appreciate your loyalty to this location!

        I would like to let you know that as always our overall experience at your hotel was awesome! My father had a great birthday and the 3 kids we had with us had an absolute blast in the pool and playing the games in your atrium. Honestly the minor issue I had, that really wasn’t even an issue (Turns out my dad asked to be moved to a higher floor and since I had asked for us to be next to each other they couldn’t do it and that’s why he was told about the other room) was nothing in comparison to the great time we had. If there is a way to resend me the survey I would be more than happy to resubmit it. I apologize for you having to take time out of your day to send me this, I’m in the resort/hotel industry as well and I would assume like myself you strive for 100% customer satisfaction.  I am absolutely satisfied with your hotel and as always will be re visiting again in the future. Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance and have a great day. 
Thank you,

> It is so exciting to hear that you have been staying at this property all these years, and what a transition is has been over time!  I know your wife said she loves coming here year after year.  As usual, we do have a breakfast buffet available and can be found included in some rates.  Unfortunately, the breakfast package cannot accompany the government rate.  I am sorry that the surprise was ruined for the closeness of your room to your father's.  Rest assured, I will take great care of you the next time you come to our property.  Please contact me directly so I may anticipate  your arrival.  Thank you again for continuing to choose to stay at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay; I appreciate your loyalty to this location!

I’m glad you enjoyed your stay; I was floored when I saw Kristin and the boys in the lobby! I’ve been trying to get together with you guys since we’ve moved back so you can all meet Kaimana. I’m not sure if you realized this is Kristin’s cousin, lol. I don’t think there’s a way to resend the survey but please let me know when you come again!
Hope to see you soon!

So sorry. She did mention something about you working there but I guess I didn’t put two and two together. Now I feel really bad. Again sorry, I hope it didn’t cause any issues with you or your department. Glad to hear your back in the area though. Kristin tells me your looking to live in Kewaunee. I absolutely love that town (don’t tell Kristin I said that though, lol). It reminds me a lot of the small town I grew up in. Still not used to the purple and gold but I’m thinking over time I might. Hopefully we see you guys soon. Good luck house hunting, they go super quick in Kewaunee. Ours was on the market less than a day and we got lucky and scooped it up.

Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay and staff interactions.  I appreciate you choosing to stay with us.  As we strive to provide excellence in service and improve our product, I was saddened to hear of your experience with our associate upon calling to inquire about the confirmation of your reservations.  It seems she had difficulty retrieving all three reservations and reflected a negative sense of service.  For that I apologize, as we do pride ourselves on delivering incomparable customer service.  I am thrilled that you enjoyed the service provided by Heather once you arrived and throughout your stay.  Being a loyal World of Hyatt member, your preference amongst the reservations should have been met.  I have made note of your preference for a room with a view and larger bathroom.  As we transition into spring, our heating system is still prepared for the colder weather and ran warm this weekend.  Fans and engineering assistance is available to lower the temperature in the room.  I appreciate you letting us know that your thermostat would not lower the temperature; I will have our staff double check the controls in the room.
Please feel free to contact me directly should you need any assistance with reservations or special needs to ensure any upcoming stays with us are worry free and full of comfort. 

Best Regards,

Kristin Cordeiro

Hello Ms Howard,

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. I'm pleased to see you enjoyed your overall stay with us and had some great interactions with our Market team and Ally, our Front Office Supervisor. I do apologize for the condition of the space between your beds, once you moved them. I also apologized that our team did not take care of this for you once it was brought to our attention, rather than you vacuuming it yourself. I will certainly review the situation with our team members. We appreciate your additional feedback on the experience in your room. We are constantly looking for ways to improve our overall guest experience and will take this into consideration moving forward.

Good afternoon Ms. Perez, 

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. Your feedback is very valuable as we use it to continually learn and grow. I am sorry to hear that our barista did not handle your complaint satisfactorily.  We will use this as a coaching opportunity with her to ensure this doesn't happen again in the future. I will also be sharing your concerns of cleanliness of your room and the clothes left behind with our housekeeping team. I am glad to hear that you enjoyed our breakfast buffet and the Pub as well. Should you have any other concerns that you would like to share please feel free to reach out to me directly.  Thank you for staying with us, and we hope the next time you are in our area you will choose the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

2018-04-10 09:46:23] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Hello Ms Pishati,

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. Our guest feedback is our most important tool and keeps us on track to providing a Hyatt experience for all of our guests. I'm happy to see  you enjoyed your overall stay with us, but disappointed to see there were some areas of your guest room experience that failed to meet your expectations. I am excited to share that we just put a new clock/media player device in all of our guests rooms that has additional power and usb outlets on it. This adds a convenient charging and power location to all of our rooms. I'm sorry that you missed that for your stay. I also apologize for any cleanliness areas we missed with your room. Again, our guest feedback is our most valuable tool and we will be sharing your experience with  our housekeeping team to make sure we learn and improve. 

Thank you again.

We appreciate you taking the time to fill out our guest experience survey. We love hearing feedback on how we can learn and improve for the future. 

I apologize about the confusion with the menu in the room. That was an oversight from when we were in the process switching out all the old menus. I do appreciate the notes you have about the food and I will pass that on to our chefs!

We will also have engineering look at your room to ensure the heating/cooling is functioning properly.

I hope that next time you're in Green Bay you consider us!

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest experience survey. We appreciate the feedback we receive as it helps us to learn and grow.It seems like we missed the marks in a few places and there are definitely some notes to take where we can improve. I appreciate your patience with us during the power outage and getting our computers back up and running. Unfortunately, with the heavy snow fall it caused an interruption in our power.

Thank  you for taking the time to fill out our guest experience survey. We appreciate feedback  as it helps us to learn and grow. It seemed like we missed the mark in a few areas and I'm sure we can do better for next time. While I'm glad you enjoyed the breakfast I feel we can do better to make sure every guest gets to enjoy it warm. I will also pass on to housekeeping for our suite keepers to be more thorough when cleaning the rooms in between stays. There is no reason for those details to be missed.

We also enjoyed the breakfast buffet. I really really appreciated the reasonable kids buffet price.

I appreciate you taking the time to fill out our guest experience survey. We appreciate feedback as it helps us to learn and grow. It sounds like we nearly provided you and your family with a perfect stay but we fell short in a few areas and gave a bad first impression. I apologize for the error with your first room and can confirm we have looked into why it happened so we can prevent it in the future. 

However, I'm thrilled that you enjoyed the food and beverage options we provided. We recently  switched up and updated our menu and we're really proud of the selection we provide. 

If you ever find yourself in Green Bay again please reach out to use so we can assist with booking your next visit!

Sincerely,

Alexandria Yungwirth

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking time to complete an experience survey.

When we are not able to meet this goal, feedback from  our guests is our most important tool in correcting any mistakes.

This was our third trip down and second with the kids. I had originally booked a double queen by mistake and I emailed them a week ahead of our stay to see about switching. Not only did they upgrade is to a king suite, but they also sent us pictures of what the room looked like. When we arrived they said we were getting free parking as well!
The room was fantastic and the kids loved having the living room to themselves. 
The first night we did run into some minor issues, but when we informed them the next morning everything was sorted right away.
Later that night the manager took the time to call us to see if all the issues were resolved. They also asked us if we would like them to bring an easter basket up for the kids :-)
That night we requested a fan for our room, and unfortunately when we plugged it in we popped a breaker, we called and they fixed it right away. Before bed we tried it in a different outlet and it happened again! Since it was already late we waited until morning to mention it to the front desk. They brought us a new fan and fixed it again. This time it didn't pop the breaker :-)
We went down to Milwaukee that day and the manager emailed me to apologize for the breaker issues. He said he emailed because he had remembered that we would be at the hockey game, so it is cool that he remembered the conversation that he had with my wife the night before.
For us we NEVER expect a stay at any hotel to be perfect. What makes a great hotel is what they do when an issue does occur. The Hyatt staff has always been quick to fix things for us.

Hello Mr Erickson,

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. I am glad to see you enjoyed your overall stay with us.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey, as we use these throughout the hotel as learning opportunities. I am pleased to see that overall you enjoyed you stay with us and that you had some great staff interactions. I noticed that we fell short in providing the best experience possible while you dined with us, and that you were looking for more variety at breakfast. I am just wondering if you were looking for more variety on the buffet or on our plated menu or just a greater variety overall?  Regarding the breakfast information  discrepancy, I have spoken with the front desk manager and we are looking into it, to ensure the proper information is being given to our guests. I apologize for the inconsistent information that was given to you, but hope that you will give us another opportunity to welcome you back. If I can be of any further assistance please feel free to contact me at the information below. Thank you again for staying with us and we look forward to welcoming you back to the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

Thank you for giving us this honest feedback from your recent experience here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am so sorry to hear about the lengthy and frustrating reservation process. I would be happy to personally take care of any future reservations you may have, simply contact me at either my email address below or by calling the hotel and asking for the manager on duty. This would alleviate any automated interruptions/delays in the future. I will also heed your comments regarding the volume in the atrium; we of course, want all of our guests to have the most tranquil stay possible, regardless of which floor they are on. 

We appreciate your positive feedback from food and beverage-especially with a colleagues name directly; these comments really go a long way. Thank you for your loyalty with World of Hyatt and please have a great week. 

Kind regards,

Matthew

Thank you for taking time to give us this valuable feedback. I sincerely apologize that the room assigning resulted in you not being able to fully enjoy our Executive suite as you absolutely should have. This will definitely be a learning experience for everyone in the Front Office department. I completely understand where you are coming from, and when I am travelling I also like to have my hotel stays quiet. 

I am happy to see that our staff was nice and empathetic, in addition to the fact that you enjoyed your breakfast. I hope that you give us an opportunity to welcome you back in the future so that we can meet and exceed both your and my expectations after this misstep on our part; I have removed some of the charges on your bill due to the inconvenience with your room. 

I appreciate your loyalty as a World of Hyatt member. Please feel free to share any additional comments you may have with me and enjoy the week ahead. 

Kind regards,

Matthew

Thank you for your continued loyalty as a World of Hyatt member. I sincerely appreciate the time any departed guest spends filling out our surveys-especially our members.  I do sincerely apologize for the lack of quality that  you received with your room and condition of the hotel. We of course, strive to provide world class service, and it is apparent that we missed the mark in several categories during your visit. I am very happy to see that one area we did very well in was our customer service and level of care-the driving forces behind everything we stand for. As I stated at check-out, I did move ahead and have 2,500 bonus points submitted to your World of Hyatt account, which was effective March 28th.  I have made sure for any future reservations that our Housekeeping team pays specific attention to the amenities in your room, ensuring that they do not deplete and that your room is well serviced during every day of your stay. Our front desk will also ensure that you are not placed on the 8th floor for stays in the future. 

I hope that you decide to give us an opportunity to welcome you back again here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. Please reach out to me with any other feedback you may like to share, or requests for future visits. Enjoy the rest of your weekend, Mr. Orabi. 

Kind regards,

Matthew

Thank you for your continued loyalty with World of Hyatt as a Discoverist. I do sincerely appreciate the time our guests spend filling out our guest surveys-especially our Elite World of Hyatt members. I am extremely disappointed to hear that our staff promised to deliver something that never arrived, in addition to the fact that the condition of your guest room was under the expectation that we seek to provide. I will make certain that the next time you come to our property that our Executive Housekeeper personally takes a walk through your room prior to your arrival. 

I am however, extremely pleased to see that our staff was courteous and outgoing, and that your food and beverage experience went well. It looks like this was your first time at our property, so I sincerely hope that you will give us another opportunity in the future so that we can turn an average experience into an incredible one. 

Please feel free to share any additional comments with me, and enjoy the rest of your weekend. 

Kind regards,

Matthew

Hello Ms Hutcherson,

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. We are thrilled to see you enjoyed your overall stay and appreciate your feedback. I noticed you rated the Staff Sincerely Cared category at a 5 and wanted to take a moment to check and see if there was anything specific that occurred that led you to rate that question a little lower. We are always looking to improve and any further detail you might be able to provide would be valuable to us.


Sincerely,

Lucas Boie
Director of Operations

I appreciate you taking the time to fill out our guest experience survey. We appreciate responses like yours as they help us to learn and grow. I appreciate all of the kind words you said about our staff. We are honored to have a great staff and we're thrilled that Heather and our Market team helped to make your stay great! However, it was disappointing to read that you had some issues with your guest room. We will bring this up to Engineering, for the room temperature and Housekeeping, for the pillows. It seems like we were so close to having a perfect experience for you and it's clear we have a few things to work on.

I hope next time you're in Green Bay you think of us, we'll get that perfect stay next time!

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. We are thrilled to see you enjoyed your overall stay with us and appreciate your feedback regarding pillows and adding more outlets. We are actually currently working on and hope to have a solution in place soon! Additionally, I noticed you scored the Staff Sincerely Cared category at a 6. I was curious if something may have happened that led you to rate that question lower than the others? If so, any further detail you may be able to provide would be greatly appreciated as I can follow up with our team and improve.

I appreciate the time that you spent to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. The feedback we receive from our World of Hyatt members is critical to ensuring a great experience for our next incoming guest. I am pleased to see that we scored highly in customer service and level of care; would you be willing to share any additional details about the remainder of our scores, so that we can target and improve areas for the next time you stay with us? I am extremely sorry for the issue with fan. Do you remember the colleagues that you spoke with regarding this issue? We of course do not want our guests waiting two days for resolution, and we should have fixed this sooner. I do not see any notes in your reservation about it, and want to make sure that we can coach our staff to prevent this type of issue from happening again. 

Once again, thank you for your feedback; I welcome any additional comments you may have. Feel free to contact me using the information found in my signature, and please enjoy the rest of your week. 

Kind regards,

Matthew

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. Your feedback is very important to us as we use it to continue to learn and grow. I noticed you scored food and beverage slightly lower than everything else, I was just wondering if there was anything specific that you weren't pleased with or any areas of opportunity for us as a hotel to improve on the food and beverage aspect.  I will be sure to pass on the compliment to Matthew as well!Thank you for staying at Hyatt Regency Green Bay!  We look forward to your next visit.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest experience survey. We appreciate the feedback we get as it helps us to learn and grow. I have to say, I love reading surveys like yours. We love the great feedback as we are proud of the level of care our staff provides. It seems like we had a near perfect stay for you, but we missed the mark in a few places. In regards to the room, our housekeeping staff has addressed the dust in the room and will ensure their team is taking the extra care in the rooms not to miss these details. I have also passed on to our Chef that their are limited, diet restrictive, options. However, next time you stay with us our chefs would be happy to be able to whip up something special for your children so they get the most out of their breakfast. It is the most important meal of the day!

I hope that the next time you find yourself in Green Bay you think of us as I'd love to welcome you back.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest experience survey. We appreciate feedback like yours as it helps to grow and learn. I would like to extend a sincere apology that your first night with us was a bit restless. I'm glad we were able to assist with reducing the noise, but I do feel bad we were not able to provide a more peaceful night for you. I will bring this up with my Hosts as this is a good example for room placement. Unfortunately, we cannot always tell which rooms are going to be louder, however we can try to space out where we put our guest to ensure everyone gets the most out of their stay.

I hope next time you are in Green Bay you think of us, we'd love to welcome you back.

I see we really missed the mark with your stay. I will definitely be using this as a coaching opportunity with my colleagues as this does not meet our expectations. I apologize that you were not able to eat dinner at the hotel and I can assure you that this will not happen again. I hope that you will give us another try on your next visit. If you would like to discuss further or there is anything I can do for you please do not hesitate to reach out to me. Thank you again for your feedback.

Based on your survey it looks like we have room for improvement in our food and beverage department.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest experience survey. We appreciate the feedback as it helps us to learn and grow. I hope you enjoyed your time here in Green Bay and I am thankful that you chose to stay with us. I would like to apologize, however, that we did not acknowledge your upgrade. This is something that should be addressed at the time of check in and unfortunately got missed in your reservation. I have already spoken with the other Front Office Managers and we have put in progress a new system so details like this don't get missed in the future.

I also noticed that you felt your guest room could have been improved. Would you be willing to elaborate on what we can improve? As a hotel we can only improve if we know what our flaws.

Sincerely,

Alexandria Yungwirth

I appreciate the time you took to fill out our guest experience survey. We appreciate your feedback as it helps us to learn and grow. I sincerely apologize that we missed the mark in several areas of your stay. It seems that we need to work on communication within the front office as many of the issues you experienced should have been avoided. I will use your experience as a coaching opportunity with my staff to ensure we're covering important details such as breakfast locations and times. We do pride ourselves in expressing great guests care and in a few different areas of your stay it seems we could have improved, especially when you needed to call down as your room was not refreshed during the day. I should also mention I have passed on to our housekeeping managers in regards to your room. It is unacceptable that this service was not provided for you.

Your stay does not reflect our standards that we work hard to implement. For that, I am sorry. I would like welcome you back next time you find yourself in Green Bay to show you that we can do better and what a true Hyatt experience is like. Please reach out to me so I can ensure every aspect of your stay meets your needs.

Sincerely,

Alexandria Yungwirth

1).  Upon arriving there were no luggage carts available and none appeared for the half hour that we sought one until we gave up and made three trips from car to room.  It seems that this could be alleviated in two ways: a)put signs on the carts asking guests to unload all luggage upon entering the room and then immediately put them outside the room if they will not be going to the lobby so that other guests can retrieve them; and (b) since luggage carts take up a lot of room provide cargo dollies with drop down lips as back ups when all carts are in use (five of these nested would take up the space of one cart in the storage room).

2). We went to a theater play that evening and returned to the lot at 9:45PM.  Upon entering we found a full lot and circled for ten minutes until there were three others doing the same.  One of us had to go into the lobby to find out what we were to do and were given vague directions as to where to go off site but no map was provided nor any info about where to park to use the walkway and how to get back into the hotel which took another fifteen minutes.  Also, the Hyatt should invest in one of those systems that says “lot is full” when there are no open spaces.

3). Upon entering the lobby through the back entrance we decided to check the hot tub and pool area at 10:15pm to determine if there was a crowd.  Surprisingly we counted almost a dozen children in the area ranging from about 5 to 15.  A complaint was made to the desk where the gentleman with the radio said he would go there to inform them of the time.  I then went to my room to change and waited until about 11PM to return to find 10 minors in the area with four of them in the hot tub...... No adult male with any common sense is going to put himself into that situation especially when there are three morbidly obese loud  “moms” there with 16oz plastic cups in hand supposedly parenting instead of being in rooms and having their kids in bed. Perhaps parents need a tactful list of reminders about how families should behave in a decent hotel including not yelling up into or across the atrium to others.  I would also suggest a large sandwich board be placed just inside the pool door at 9:30PM reminding all about the 10PM curfew since many ignore the door signage.   Additional personnel would be beneficial when there is high occupancy since the one man with radio seemed to be juggling a lot.... At 11:05 I again located the gentleman with the radio who responded that he had just checked the area.  I told him of my disgust with the situation and that I was returning to my room.  At about 11:20 we got a phone call from the man who apologized and told us that he would authorize the room discount.  That was a good response because we were discussing among ourselves that perhaps we should give up on the Hyatt for future GB stays due to the perception that families with children might be the preferred demographic for the Hyatt now. —-End narrative; ;See narrative; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","I will list the problems herein but prior to doing so will state that the percentage discount mitigated some of the frustration, irritation and anger felt and expressed due to three problems encountered on the 9th of March due to apparently full occupancy.

I appreciate the time you took to fill out our guest experience survey, we appreciate feedback we receive as it helps us to learn and grow. It seems, based on your experience, that we have several areas we can coach our staff to avoid the issues you experienced with your stay. It all starts with making the reservation. It seems like you received all sorts of different information, which I understand can add stress to what should be a straight forward process. I am sincerely sorry that this was made difficult for you. I am a strong believer in first impressions, and it seems we unintentionally left a bad first impression with you. In regards to your food and beverage service, from breakfast to the pub I have taken notes and brought them to our Food and Beverage managers. It is unacceptable that you felt the service you received was rude, and this will be investigated.

I also am I strong believer that bad first impressions can be changed however. I would appreciate the opportunity to show you what a true Hyatt experience is all about. Please reach out to me as I would love to personalize your future stay and ensure you feel cared for.

Please reach out to me in regards to your parking as well. I truly hope a refund has been issued for the $45 you paid at the gate. While we do charge $5/night for parking in our guest lot, the fee you occurred at the exit gate should be refunded.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our Guest Satisfaction Survey, as these are used throughout the hotel as a learning opportunity for our colleagues. Overall it appears that you enjoyed your stay with us, but it seems that we fell short on providing the best experience possible during your dining experience. Would you be able to share any information with me regarding your dining experience,  so we may use this as a coaching opportunity to ensure it does not occur again. We strive to provide exceptional food and service to all of our guests and I am sorry we fell short during your stay with us. Please feel free to contact me if I can be of any further assistance, at the information listed below. Thank you again for staying with us and we look forward to welcoming you back for future visits.

Sincerely,
Jeni

I would like to start by thanking you for taking the time to provide feedback for our hotel. We truly appreciate the information we get as it gives us something to build off of. I have to say that I felt very disappointed while reading your check-in experience. We pride our self in making our hotel feel like a home away from home and that goes with a warm welcome. We more then failed when you walked in the door, and for that I am very sorry. There were many details that you provided that could have been easy fixes, had we taken the time, that would have drastically changed the entire experience. I will use this as a coaching tool with my staff and also stress the importance of expressing care. 

I would love to welcome you back and show you that this is not our typical hospitality. Please reach out to me next time you're in town and I can ensure you feel welcome and cared for.

Something also worth mentioning, your notes about your conventions food service have been passed on. We keep notes so we know what went well and what can improve for years to come. For example, you mentioned that there was two lines for dinner, we will consider a smoother operation next year so you may enjoy warm food when it's your turn in line.

Warm Regards,

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest experience survey. I apologize that your experience was no where near perfect. It's evident that there are things that we need to take a deeper look into and see how we can improve for the future. I am very disappointed reading your experience as I know this is not a true to the standards that we pride ourselves in. This experience never should have occurred, we are looking into it and using it as a coaching opportunity for our staff so that we can ensure that guest feel safe throughout all aspects of the hotel, including when the pool is being service, alternative parking options and in our guest rooms. In the future, I will ensure that our host are asking more detailed questions so we can better address issues before they occur, especially in regards to your rate.

As I said above, I am very sorry for your poor experience and I would like to assure you that we do listen to the replies we get and we truly do want to improve for the future. I looked at your profile and I noticed that you are a World of Hyatt member. I have already added 5000 points on to your account. I hope that you can use these points on your next trip, whether it be at our location or another Hyatt worldwide.

If you have any other concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me personally.

2018-03-10 14:01:53] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good afternoon Mr. Walsh,

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey; it is truly relevant to us as we strive to grow and continue to create the next level of excellent service. With that being said, it looks like we have a few areas that we did not score too well on during your stay. I can assure you that in one of our meetings last week, we were discussing the possible future implementation of additional electrical outlets for convenience in our guest rooms. While I do not have a time-line on that at this moment, I want you to know that your concerns are shared with the team here at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. 

Would you be willing to provide any additional feedback regarding your check-in experience? I would sincerely appreciate any information you would be willing to share so that we can best assist and facilitate the growth of our colleagues, team, and overall guest experience. 

Thank you for your membership with World of Hyatt and please enjoy the rest of your weekend. 

Kind regards,

Matthew

I appreciate you taking the time to fill out our guest experience survey. We appreciate the feedback we receive as it helps us to learn and grow. In regards to breakfast, we do pride ourself in having a fresh, high quality spread with plenty of variety. We also have our Market for grab and go type items. The Market also has coffee and pastries in the morning for a lighter fair. Looking at your survey it seems we didn't quiet hit the mark in other areas of our hotel. Would you be willing to elaborate a little more on your stay so we know where we can improve for next time?

I am, however, glad that you enjoyed your dinner in the pub!

Next time you're in Green Bay, please reach out to me and I can buy you breakfast for your next stay.

Warm Regards,

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. Our guest's feedback is our most important tool and helps us meet our goal of providing the best experience possible to each of our guests. I'm delighted to see you found our service to be top notch and you enjoyed your interactions with our staff. I'm sorry to hear we may have missed housekeeping service for your friends room. If you are able to provide your friends name, I would like to look into why this occurred to ensure it does not happen again. Additionally, if there was anything else during your stay that would have made it a 10, your detailed feedback would be greatly valued.

Thank you for your time.

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. I'm glad to see you enjoyed your overall stay and that your interactions with the Front Desk team were memorable. I am sorry to hear you felt your bed was uncomfortable. Depending on your preferences, either firmer or softer, there may be things we can do during your stay to help you get a better night's sleep. Additionally, we are considering updating our mattresses for the entire hotel this year. 

Also, in looking at your reservation history, I see that you had responded to our upgrade email but that your reservation did not receive an upgrade prior to your arrival. So you did stay in the room type you had booked and there was no additional charge for the upgrade added. At this point, I am unable to determine why the upgrade was not accommodated and I apologize for our lack of communication on this matter. We should have discussed this either way at the time of your arrival. We will review this process with our team. Please reach out to me directly prior to your next stay and I'm happy to look into the availability of a complimentary upgrade.



Sincerely,

Lucas Boie

Thank you for taking your time to fill out our Guest Satisfaction Survey, as we use these throughout the hotel as learning opportunities for our colleagues.

We strive to provide exceptional service and food to all of our guests, no matter how busy or slow the restaurant is. We will be using this as a training opportunity for both our Pub staff and our culinary staff, so they are better prepared to handle similar situations in the future. Again, I would like to apologize for the less than satisfactory experience you had with us but I hope you will give us another chance to provide you the exceptional service and food that we pride ourselves in. If I can be of any further assistance , please feel free to contact me at the email below. Thank you again for staying with us here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay and I hope we have the chance to welcome you back for future visits.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest experience survey. We appreciate feedback like yours to help us learn and grow. It seems like we had almost the perfect stay for you, but we missed the mark with the temperature in the room! Unfortunately, this time of year is difficult to regulate the temperature of the hotel as the weather outside changes frequently. I'll work with our engineering team to see how we can better improve this for the future because I a good night sleep is important! 

Other than the temperature, I'm thrilled that you loved the room and had a good experience with our staff and the restaurant. I'd love to welcome you back next time you're in Green Bay so we can make sure your next stay is perfect!

Sincerely,

I appreciated the time you took to fill out our guest experience survey. We love getting feedback like yours as it helps us to assess how we can learn and grow for the future. I especially love hearing that you had a great stay and you enjoyed your room. Unfortunately, we missed the mark in a few areas. I will work with engineering and housekeeping in regards to the blow dryer and the cool water. I will also address the slow check in line you experienced. That is not our normal and I will ensure we are more appropriately staffed in the future.

I apologize that we didn't make it a perfect stay but I would love to welcome you back next time you are in Green Bay to show that we can do better.

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. Our guest's feedback is the most valuable tool we have and we appreciate hearing about the details of your stay. I apologize for the refrigerator and thermostat issues that occurred in your room. We will have our engineering team check on these items to ensure both are functioning properly moving forward. I am also terribly sorry to hear about the cleanliness issues you experienced in your guest room. The details provided certainly do not meet our standards and I apologize. As a gesture of apology and appreciation for providing this feedback, I would be happy to extend an offer of complimentary breakfast and parking on your next visit with us. Please reach out to me directly on your next stay and I can make sure these details are arranged.

I am happy to hear you found our staff to be friendly and accommodating and hope you enjoyed visiting family/friends here in Green Bay.

Thank you for staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay and for taking the time to complete an experience survey. We value and utilize all of our guests feedback, and it plays an important role as we strive to continually provide the best experience possible for our guests. I'm sorry to hear you experienced issues with the heating system, bedroom tv, and that our front parking lot was full. I will certainly have our engineering team check on the HVAC and tv to ensure both are in proper working order. We appreciate your feedback regarding the bathroom fans and chocolate milk charges. We will consider both as we look ahead.

Again, thank you for your time and feedback. We hope you enjoyed the wedding you attended and hope to see you back again with us soon.

Good day Ms. Marten,


                     I would first like to thank you for taking the time to fill out a survey. These help us improve in areas that we may be lacking in or give a great job to our employees!  In this case it seems  we may have not lived up to our best. I would like to apologize for the air vent and its cleanliness. I have addressed  this issue with my staff and taken care of this vent. As for the bed spread I have made sure that was pulled out of the inventory so that it will not end up on anther bed. I again thank you for your feed back and hope on next visit we can make sure the Keys are working properly and your room is clean to what I would expect for our guests.

	Thank you for taking the time to fill out our survey and provide us with feedback about your stay.  I want to apologize for the unfortunate lack of quality in your food. I just want to take time to say that we always use fresh ingredients and strive to make the best food we possibly can.  That being said we obviously missed the mark with your meal. If you wouldn’t mind taking the time to let me know what you ordered I can do my best to assure such a problem does not happen again. We will use this as a learning experience and hope to be able to surpass your expectations if we have the opportunity to serve you again. If you have any other concerns or comments please contact me at the email below.
Thank you

Thank for you taking your time to fill out our Guest Satisfaction Survey. I would like to thank you for coming to the WAA conference and for choosing to stay at the Hyatt. Thank you for your continued patronage and I apologize for how last call was handled on your last evening with us. While the staff was following procedure when they called last call, it should have been handle more professionally and for that I apologize. When we have larger groups stay with us, such as the WAA, we do have security in the bar with us after last call has been called, to ensure all the patrons are outside of the bar by 2 am per Wisconsin law. While all the patrons do have to be outside of the bar by 2am, they are more than welcome to take their unconsumed drinks with them up to their rooms. Again, I am sorry if that was not conveyed or if it was not conveyed in a professional manner. We will be using this as a coaching opportunity for our staff, to ensure that they are being professional in all aspect of the job and treating our guests with respect. Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance and thank you again for staying with us. 

Sincerely,
Jeni

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest experience survey. We appreciate the feed back from guest, such as yourself, as it helps us to learn and grow. Your response gave us a lot to think about in the way of improvements for next year. We will put in our notes for future conferences that it was difficult to pass through to different parts of the KI center and the hotel during breakfast hours. In regards to the noisy room and balcony door I am deeply sorry. I have alerted our engineering team to correct the issues.

On a brighter note, I am thrilled that you enjoyed the food and beverage service this year and that we had improvements from previous years. I am also pleased to hear that Elizabeth did an excellent job, we'll make sure to pass on the praise! 

We look forward to having you next time you're in Green bay!

I am pleased to see that overall you enjoyed your visit with us, but would like to apologize for falling short on providing the best food and beverage experience possible. Would you be willing to share with me what you had when you dined with us in the Pub? We will be using this as a learning opportunity for both our culinary team and staff to ensure we are providing quality food and service during both slow times as well as busy times. If i can be of any further assistance please, feel free to contact me at the information below. Thank you again for staying with us and we look forward to welcoming you back for future visits with us here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

Thanks for reaching out about this.  The Hyatt customer service never fails to impress me!
The food issues in the Pub weren't anything too much, just a couple mild complaints:
I stopped in the Pub on a Monday evening (around 7pm) with another person.  He ordered the 'hot mess sandwich' and thought there was too much sauce/toppings, he never would have guessed he was eating chicken.  
I ordered the 'refresh salad' which would have been good if it wasn't swimming in dressing.  I ended up eating the top later of salad greens and leaving the rest, unfortunately.  I gladly would have finished the salad if there wasn't so much dressing- the entire bottom of my plate was a pool of dressing.  A little balsamic vinaigrette goes a very long way with its tanginess. I usually ask for dressing on the side, but I thought I'd go bold and let it come however the chef prepared it.  (I recently read that customers tend to use more dressing than when the chef prepares it- hah!)  The baguette slice with the salad would have been good, without the fake-butter on it.  The fruit was unimpressive, but not terrible- typical for this time of the year anywhere.  
We also ordered the 'fried cheesecake dessert.'  Which was okay at best.  I'll gladly pay higher prices for good desserts, but I thought the price did not match the amount and quality here.  
We might eat there again, but only because of the convenience, not because of the food.    
The server was friendly enough, though.
Best,
Sarah

Thank you so much for taking the time to fill out our guest experience survey. It’s responses such as yours that help us to learn and grow.  I’d like to start by saying that I’m thrilled you thought our housekeeping staff was wonderful, I have to say I feel the same!

I also agree that while we are invested in our guest experience we should also look the part. That is why we are continuously looking for ways to update our social spaces as well as our guest rooms. It is unacceptable that your room felt dirty, even though it was clean. This is something that I will discuss with our housekeeping management to see where we can improve.

In regards to our restaurant I am deeply sorry that you had a less than ideal experience. Our restaurant does stop serving our main menu at 10 pm, but there is no reason you should have been declined at 9:45. I will investigate this with the Pub and ensure this does not happen again. We will also address your experience at breakfast.

Overall, I would like to apologize for a less than ideal stay as I know we can do better. As stated above, we truly do love hearing feedback as it helps us to improve. I know with your next visit we will have addressed your concerns and we can show you what we’re really all about, a great guest experience.

Warm Regards,

Ally

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our survey and provide us with feedback about your stay. While I’m glad you enjoyed the majority of your stay I want to apologize for the apparent lack of variety in the meals offered at Pub 333. While we try to present a varied menu with many options, we seem to have fallen short of your expectations. We are currently in the process of reinventing our menu. Hopefully, if we have the opportunity to serve you again, we will be able to fulfill your expectations.  If you have any other concerns or comments please feel free to contact me at the email below.
Thank you. 

Sincerely,

Adam Zelten
Sous Chef

                            Thank you for taking the time to fill out a survey. Surveys help us find out how we need to improve as a team and hotel.  I can see by yours we have failed to provide you with the great Hyatt experience you expect and deserve.  I have talked with our Engineering  team   about the commode issues and they will check the commode over to see if it needs to be replaced or if its just a part issue. I also have them looking into the heating unit and I'm sorry your room was not warm enough for you as it has been a cold winter.  As for our Guest Privacy Door hangers Hyatt Corporate  is currently working on revamping these as they are a Hyatt Standard issue. We are hoping to have new ones sometime in March or beginning of April.  Again thank you for filling out a survey and I hope on your next visit we can meet and exceed your expectations.

Dear Mr. Lewis,

                              Thank you for taking the time to fill out a survey and letting us know about the areas that did not meet your expectations.  As the Director of Housekeeping I would like to apologize for the room issues. I will make sure to address these issues with the housekeeping staff and hope that on your next visit we can prove to you that this was a slip up in our cleaning and we have corrected the issues.

I would like to start off by thanking you for taking the time to fill out our guest experience survey! We appreciate the feedback as it helps us to learn and grow. I am always thrilled when I get feedback like yours and I'm truly glad you enjoyed your stay. Of course, except for the less than friendly welcome.

I will work with my staff and remind them the importance of making lasting first impressions.

Thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. This feedback is absolutely essential to our growth, as it allows us to best identify areas where we have an opportunity for improvement. I know that during your stay there was a question about the heating process, and that I personally spoke with you and later left a message on your  guest phone, as our Engineering department had assured me that the situation was resolved. Would you be able to provide specific examples of things that occurred during your stay, so that we can collaborate as a team to best prepare for your next arrival? Please feel free to respond to the email in my signature at your leisure, with absolutely any information you would be willing to share. Your feedback is a gift to us, and as such, I look forward to hearing from you. 

Warm regards,

Matthew

Good morning Luann,

                       Thank you for taking the time to fill out a Comment card for your most recent stay at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.  I apologize that no one called you back about your lost and found item.  I would like to make sure this was taken care of. Please feel free to call me at my direct number of 920-321-5073. Again I would like to apologize as we are normally very prompt at returning lost and found calls and we have failed at meeting ours and your expectations.   


Sincerely,

Daniel Kaiser

Good Morning Susan, 

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. Your feedback is very important to us as we use it to continue to grow and improve.  I do apologize that we ran out of the fish during your stay and that your second choice food option of nachos didn't exceed your expectations.   We strive to provide quality food and service throughout our hotel and we seemed to miss the mark on your visit. If you have any suggestions on how we could improve on the nachos, I will definitely pass them on to culinary. I hope that the rest of your stay was enjoyable and  that you will give us another try on your next visit to Green Bay!

I want to start by thanking you for taking the time to fill out our guest experience survey. We appreciate feedback like yours as it helps us to learn and grow. I have to say, I was left feeling disappointed while reading your survey. We strive to provide a ""home away from home"" feel in our guest rooms and we definitely missed the mark. I have addressed the smoke smell with our housekeeping department. We are a smoke free hotel and there should be no reason for that smell. I do apologize! 

If you ever find your self in Green Bay I'd love to welcome you back and show you that we can do better. Please reach out to me so I can hand pick a room for you that is away from street to provide a more restful experience.

I would like to thank you for taking the time to fill out our guest experience survey. We appreciated the feedback as it helps us to learn and grow. I would also like to apologize for the miscommunication at check-in. I went ahead and adjusted your breakfast rate to the correct Associated Bank discount. You should have already received an email with your updated folio and you can expect to see your refund in the next few business days. For future stays be sure to let our breakfast staff know you are an Associated Bank employee and they will ensure you get the discounted rate. I will make sure to work with my host to explain this more clearly to reduce any error in the future. I would also like to inquire about the rest of your survey, it seems like we didn't do horrible, but there is definitely room for improvement. Would you be willing to provide a little more detail on anything else we could improve?

2018-01-25 19:40:37] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good evening Ms. Herrmann,

i would like to thank you for taking the time to submit your honest appraisal of the accommodations you had while staying with us at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am so glad to see that the Front Desk staff was able to hospitably take care of you and provide good and sincere service. However, I am truly, truly sorry for the extreme lack of quality that you experienced during your short, one night stay with us in your guest room. I will be reviewing your comments with our Executive Housekeeper, so that we can ensure that everyone on our staff is paying the utmost attention to detail when turning over rooms for our next incoming guests. I will also have our Engineering department take a look at the remote and clock radio in your bedroom to make sure that there are no further inconveniences experienced in room 712. 

Again, I appreciate your feedback, as well as your loyalty as a World of Hyatt member. Please have a fantastic weekend Ms. Herrmann. 

Warm regards,

Matthew

Thank you for responding to Hyatt's Guest Satisfaction Survey. I apologize that the cleanliness of the room was not up to your, or our, standards. I assure you this is not typical of our guest rooms and I am disappointed your room was left this way. I hope you come back to visit us so we can provide you with a proper guest room. I am pleased to see you had great interactions with our staff! We strive to provide exceptional customer service and facilities; next time we will be sure to hit the mark on both of them! 

Please let me know if there is ever anything I can do for you and I will be more than happy to assist.

2018-01-19 18:40:09] Email received from: Jenifer Rajala <jenifer.rajala@gmail.com>: Dear Ms. Yungwirth,
Thank you for your reply.  I would like to clarify my comment about the
staffing level at your front desk.   I did not feel inconvenienced.  I have
much experience in customer service and have a great appreciation for those
working in any kind of service industry.  I did however feel a great deal
of empathy for the young women at the desk who were doing their best to
serve the guests at the desk, w hile the phones were ringing non-stop.  I
suspect those individuals likely did not enjoy having their calls placed on
hold.  Your staff handled it all calmly and with grace.
Regards,
Jenifer Rajala

Thank you for taking the time to complete Hyatt's Guest Satisfaction Survey. We sincerely appreciate your feedback. I am pleased that you and your fiancé had such a great time during your stay! Those are definitely the comments we love to hear. 

I was hoping you could provide me some background on your check in experience. I see that you rated it mediocre. Did something go wrong when you were checking into your room? Please let me know so I can discuss with my staff!

We hope to see you again in the near future! I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

2018-01-14 19:53:43] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good evening Ms. Read,

Thank you for your graciously positive comments commending our staff. It is especially great to see someone mention several departments in one survey, and to mention how much of an impact they created with a guest experience. We are always ready to celebrate successes with everyone on our team, and we cannot do that without your feedback.

Please allow me to apologize for the audible inconvenience in room 813. As I am not an Engineer myself, I will make sure to speak with that team to see that if there is anything we can do to alleviate or muffle the noise, we will be sure to handle it expeditiously. 

Again, I appreciate your comments as well as the time it took to fill out our guest satisfaction survey. I hope you have a fantastic week Ms. Read. 

Kind regards,

Matthew

Hello Mr. Ryan,

                 Thank you for taking the time to fill out a survey and let us know the issues you had with your room.  I would like to let you know this is not normal for the way our rooms look here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I have personally went to this room and polished the sink handles. I have also made this a weekly project for all the Housekeeping team members to focus on. Again I would like to apologize for the quality of your room and I hope if you stay with us again we can prove that our rooms are top notch.


Sincerely,

Daniel Kaiser

Please allow me to apologize for the experience that you had with your guest room and dining accommodations. I know that we have personally spoken before, and I must emphasize-this is not reflective of the atmosphere that we are here to provide. Our volume account customers and World of Hyatt members are particularly important to us, as we seek to create long-term, meaningful connections with our guests. 

I hope that we can look past this anomaly, and that you choose to stay with us the next time you are in town on business. I will make sure that your room is walked by our Executive Housekeeper for any future arrivals. 

Wishing you a successful, prosperous start to the new year. 

Warm regards,

Matthew

Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your honest and detailed feedback. It really is important to addressing various needs and updates that we need to take action on, to provide the best possible experience for the next incoming guest. As such, our Engineering team will be looking at the insulation in room 517 to make sure that it gets to the standard we are here to provide. 

I am so glad to see that you had such positive and kind things to say about our staff! Please, if there is ever any issues regarding comfort in one of your future stays, feel free to contact the Front Desk or nearest hotel associate that you cross paths with; we are here to work as a team to take excellent care of you. I will share your comments regarding the lack of outlets and elevator speeds with other managers in the hotel, and I apologize for any inconvenience these issues caused. I hope you have a great week and a fantastic start to the new year. 

Kind regards,

Matthew
