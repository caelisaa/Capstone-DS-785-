Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am the Rooms Supervisor here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you today to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Ms. Ryan, I do apologize for apparent miscommunication.  As a globalist you are entitled to free breakfast at any Hyatt Regency property worldwide.  I'm also sorry that our menu is still limited at the current time.  I would enjoy a few more options on the menu as well myself.  We are hoping to expand the menu again in the near future.  If you would be able to please confirm for me the reason you scored your food & beverage experience so low, I'd appreciate it.  Was it solely due to the limited menu available?  Or did you have a bad experience you haven't mentioned yet?  I'd like to know if there's anything else we need to improve upon.  Since you weren't able to utilize your complimentary breakfast benefit, I've taken the liberty of awarding your World of Hyatt account with 5,000 points, the equivalence of a $25 dining credit.

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

Mr. Adams, I do apologize for the confusion, but our bathrooms don't actually have individual fans in each room as our ventilation system utilizes what's called a passive ventilation system, basically that means the whole ventilation system is connected and any fans at all are located on the roof of the hotel.  I'm sorry you expected a fan and there wasn't one for you.  I'm glad to know that other than that you had a good stay.   

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly.

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am the Rooms Supervisor here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you today to first of all thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests, such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however; based on your response, we have some room for improvement. 

Mr. Greenwood, I'm sorry to hear that you did not feel as valued with World of Hyatt as you do with the hotels that you stay with frequently, as we value every one of our guests.  If you look on the World of Hyatt website, new member perks are different based on the specific brand within the Hyatt family you are staying with.  For instance: even as a brand new World of Hyatt member, if you stay at a Hyatt Place hotel, you receive free breakfast.  The longer you are a member of World of Hyatt and stay at our properties more frequently, the perks add up fast.  However, if there are any ideas or suggestions you may have for how we should recognize our World of Hyatt members better, I'd appreciate if you'd share those with me.  

On the topic of your sofa bed in the room, I am also sorry to hear about the condition of it.  I am thankful that you brought this to our attention and I have already passed on the information to my Engineering department to have that addressed.   

One thing I need to ask of you, is if you could provide any more detailed feedback regarding your experiences with our Food & Beverage department and the breakfast service.  It appears you rated them at a 0 out of 10 and I'm just wondering if there was anything specific that went wrong that needs to be addressed.  So if you'd elaborate a little on that topic, it would greatly appreciated.

I would like to extend my gratitude for you taking your time to provide your feedback and look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience.  Once again, thank you for your time and your response.

Happy New Year!

Sincerely,

Andrew Monroe

Mr. Kinney, I'm so sorry to see based on your survey response that you had such an awful experience at our property.

Additionally, if you have any preferences for any future accommodations, I'd like to be informed of those as well so you can be as comfortable as possible during your stay at any Hyatt property.

If we don't know that you have a problem with anything, then we have no way of fixing it for you.  I am sorry that you had to endure an dusty, musty room, especially since you didn't have to.  I'm sorry that Ebru didn't inform you at check-in that Pub 333 was not closed on Christmas, and also that our amenities were not clearly explained by Ebru nor was it well explained in the welcome letter provided to you at check-in that has information on all of our amenities.

2021-12-28 08:35:38] Email received from: kathryn liggett <liggettkathryn@gmail.com>: Thank you Andrew for your response. I expected a lot more for the price
that we paid for this room. I figured you gave us the best room that you
had. Had I known that I would have to complain in order to receive a
renovated room I absolutely would have done so.
Ebru did not provide us with any information except to inform us to wear
our masks in public spaces. You can provide your welcome letter all that
you want but true customer service is not a pamphlet thrown at you. We will
stay elsewhere in the future.

Now I'm sure you're aware of this, but the cost of every single hotel room in Green Bay and the surrounding cities goes up exponentially whenever there is a Green Bay Packers home game.  Also, the closer you get to the date of the game, the higher the rates are for whatever remaining hotel rooms that there are.  Especially if you book in any less than 2 months before the game.  That is when hotel rooms are at the highest that they're ever going to be.  I'm sorry if you were misled to believing that you were receiving any room type other than what you booked, a standard Double Queen Suite, our base level room-type.   If we gave you any indication that you would receive a complimentary upgrade on one of our busiest days of the year, I do sincerely apologize.  

You appear to have misunderstood what I said regarding communicating with the front desk any issues you might have with your room.  Had you expressed your dissatisfaction with your room, we would have gladly found you another room that would hopefully be more to your liking.  In no way does complaining guarantee you'll get an upgrade by any means.  We would have done anything within our ability to get you into a room you are satisfied with so long as we had one available, and we also would have done whatever we deemed necessary to ensure your satisfaction throughout the rest of your stay.  

In regards to Ebru and the welcome letter, I'm sorry if she did in fact not highlight any of the information on your welcome letter, as she is supposed to go over a few major points beyond our mask recommendation.  I appreciate your feedback on your opinion of true customer service.  I will take that into consideration.  I am deeply sorry that you feel the need to stay elsewhere in the future.  I hope that when you are looking at coming to Green Bay for another Packers victory, you'll see the rates other properties charge along with what amenities they offer and compare it to the Hyatt.  If you decide that you would like to go elsewhere, I cannot stop you.  I do ask that you to give us another chance to serve you better in the future.  We'd like the opportunity to ""wow"" you as we do so many of our guests.  

Happy Holidays and Best Wishes!

Sincerely,

Andrew Monroe

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am the Rooms Supervisor here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you today to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Mr. Thiry, I do apologize for the state of your room upon arrival.  Thank you for bringing these items to my attention, I've already addressed the maintenance issues with my engineering department.  I agree that our guest rooms are overdue to be updated, if I'm not mistaken we do have some rooms being set for such updates in the near future.  Mr. Thiry, based on your survey response, it does appear that your overall experience with the Front Desk was less than exceptional.  If you wouldn't mind, would you please go into a little more detail about what you feel we need to improve upon in respect to the check-in process as well as our customer service that we provided to you. as those were 2 of the lower scores on your survey.

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

Mr. Polczinski, I do apologize for the unaccommodating attitude you received from our food & beverage staff.  At the front desk, we would have given you zero push back regarding the wine glasses you requested and I'm sorry that your bartender failed to provide them for you.  I know that the bartenders are told that whenever a drink is ordered to be brought to the room it has to be served in plastic drinkware, I'm thinking that's where the disconnect took place for the individual.  I'm also so sorry to hear about the coffee maker in your room, but I'm glad you were able to get the superior coffee from the Starbucks outlet in the Market.  On another note, on your survey you had scored your World of Hyatt experience as being rather mediocre.  If you don't mind elaborating on that score a little, I'd appreciate it.  Specifically I'd like to know just what are your expectations of the hotel in regards to your membership in World of Hyatt that we are failing to provide for you?

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

I am reaching out to you today to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey.

We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Ms. Rodgers, I do apologize for the cleanliness of your room meeting neither yours nor Hyatt's standards for cleanliness by sounds of it.  I've brought your concerns to the attention of our Executive Housekeeper and we will be addressing the matter with the attendant who serviced your room to ensure they are properly trained on cleaning our guest rooms.  I offer my sincerest apology if they had, in fact, left the sink and toilet unclean, as any cleanliness issue in a restroom, in my opinion, is an especially big deal. 

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

Sincerely,

Andrew Monroe

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am the Rooms Supervisor here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you today to first of all thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests, such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however; based on your response, we have some room for improvement. 

Ms. Vance, first of all, I would like to apologize for our shuttle service being currently suspended as a precautionary measure in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  It has been out of service since the start of the pandemic and will be indefinitely until further notice.  Also, I'm sorry that we were unable to provide daily housekeeping service during your stay as we, like many businesses out there, are having great difficulty in acquiring new talent to fill our many open positions.  Unfortunately, daily housekeeping stayover service was one of the services that was limited in order to accommodate for the staffing shortage and can only be provided if staffing levels as well as the business volume permit it and I'm sorry we didn't have the staffing available to accommodate your request that day.  You did also mention the front desk not being helpful in your response, but unfortunately that cannot be addressed unless you go into a little bit of detail as to what you were asking of them and how they weren't helpful.  If you wouldn't mind delving a little deeper into that I'd appreciate it.  Also I see in your response that you rated your World of Hyatt experience as being subpar as well.  I'd like to understand what you expect from the hotel out of your World of Hyatt membership beyond what we provided I'd also appreciate that.  In general, I need more information to address your concerns, so if you can share any more detailed feedback on how we could have better met and exceeded your expectations, I would greatly appreciate it.  Additionally, if you have any preferences for any future accommodations, I'd like to be informed of those as well so you can be as comfortable as possible during your stay at any Hyatt property.

I would like to extend my gratitude for you taking your time to provide your feedback and look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience.  Once again, thank you for your time and your response.

2021-12-21 07:17:30] Email received from: Penny Vance <Penny.Vance@drewcentral.org>: Mr. Monroe,
I guess the real issue with my stay was what I expected out of a $400 a night hotel.  We came in for the game, and had never been to Green Bay before.  Due to flight changes made by Delta, we ended up flying in on Friday instead of the original Saturday night.  Therefore, we had to stay at another hotel, we chose the Whyndham, it was $89.  We were able to utilized their shuttle service, (masked and vaccinated, they say it helps) and the staff gave us several hints and tips for navigating and eating in Green Bay. 
When I made the reservation at Hyatt, I called instead of making it on-line so I could talk to a human.  I was told there was an air-port shuttle and I was also told the hotel was in walking distance to the stadium.  Now maybe the person I spoke to was in Singapore, I don't know, but neither of those things panned out.
As I have done some traveling during the pandemic, at most hotels if you request housekeeping, the hotel will provide it.  
The room temperature was not able to be regulated correctly, and it was stifling in our room.  We did manage to open the sliding door and that helped somewhat.
As to the front desk, it wasn't so much that when I asked a question, they refused to answer, it was more the lack of a helpful attitude, as was not the case at Whyndham, were they seemed happy to offer help with things I didn't even really know I needed to know.  The Hyatt staff did however agree to hold our bags on Monday, after check-out, when we took our stadium tour before flying out.
Thank you for your concern, 
Penny Vance

I am glad to hear you had such a positive experience with another property.  Thank you for informing of their policies and procedures.  I'll  take them into consideration when we reevaluate our own.  I'm sorry to hear about the misinformation you received from our central reservations team, I'll address that this immediately to try and make sure they have accurate information to provide prospective guests.  I am also sorry to hear about your issues with the heating/cooling in your room.  It doesn't appear that you reached out to the front desk regarding the problem, if you ever encounter an issue with your room in the future, please let us know so we can either get you a new room or fix the problem with your current room assignment. As to the attitude of the front desk agents, I'll address that personally with the front desk staff.  There's no reason they should be anything less than happy to help you.   

Once again, I'd like to say thank you for your time and providing your feedback.

Sincerely,

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am the Rooms Supervisor here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you today to first thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Mrs. Calabria, I would like to extend my sincerest apologies issues you encountered during your stay.  Thank you for bringing your cleanliness concerns to my attention,  I have passed along this information to my housekeeping supervisors and it will be addressed with the staff accordingly.  In respect to your experience calling a cab, I am deeply sorry that the front desk failed to go that extra mile and call the cab for you themselves.  I'll be addressing the front desk concerns directly myself.  As far as parking is concerned, I again apologize if you forgot about our parking policy as you have paid the parking fee in the past.  Nonetheless, we charge even our elite World of Hyatt members for parking, so I'm sorry our policies don't align with your personal opinion.  On the topic of Covid-19 related measures and precautions, I'm sorry that our shuttle service is no longer available, as it was suspended indefinitely at the start of the pandemic and will continue to be suspended until further notice.  As for our mask recommendation, we can only go so far to enforce this in the hotel.  It is Hyatt's position that guests who are vaccinated are  not REQUIRED to wear masks, we do however ask that ALL guests wear them for everyone's safety.  Unfortunately, demanding to see a guest's vaccination record in order to allow them to go about without a mask is an invasion of their privacy, and as much as we wish to keep all of our guest's safe, we cannot go to such lengths as to violate any of our guests in the process.  All-in-all, I understand that the standards you hold for this property were not lived up to, and for our falling short of your expectations,  I have awarded your World of Hyatt membership account an additional 4,000 points. 

If you have and questions for me or if there is any additional feedback you might have in regards to how we can better meet and exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again thank you for your time and response.

2021-12-18 21:22:57] Email received from: Karl Keener <karl.keener@gmail.com>: Good Evening Andrew,
Perhaps I should start from the beginning. Before I made the reservations I check ed out bth the Hyatt and Hotel.com websites. We had stayed at this hotel. few times some years ago and enjoyed our stays. What I saw on the website were some great photos of beautifully well-lit and furnished rooms. I also specifically looked for restaurant and bar information because I knew we would be arriving in the evening. There was no indication that the restaurant and bar are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays;we arrived Monday evening, 12/13.
If you have not seen it lately you should look at room 801. Be careful as you walk in as the carpeting is loose and literally has waves of excess carpet. As I am a business man I expected in a King room of that size and price a desk and chair or some kind of work station; 801 has neither. 
My wife and I both like to read when we go to bed but as you will notice there is a reading lamp on only one of the two night stands. As for the furniture, there is a large over-sized sofas/sectional but no tables to place something to eat or drink. 
Over the years I have stayed at many Hyatt Regencies and this is by far the worst of any Hyatt or other well respected hotel I have encountered. 
When ones goes downstairs in search of food the Market is the only option on Mondays and Tuesdays, and every time I was down there it was not staffed. Therefore I searched around looking for some thing edible and then had to take it to the front desk to have it charged to my room.
I could go on and on, but I’ve already wasted far too much time and money on your hotel. When I said “everything could be improved”, I was not kidding. I know Covid has impacted every one but we have stayed in other hotels in the past 20 months and they are all doing a much better job of accommodating their guests that the Hyatt Regency in Green Bay.
If I was the General Manager or Hyatt Corporate I would be making a lot of changes from top to bottom.
Respectfully,
Karl Keener

Unfortunately, feedback that is this vague really gives nothing to work with as it doesn't specify anything in particular that went wrong.  If you can share any more detailed feedback on how we could have better met and exceeded your expectations, I would greatly appreciate it.  Additionally, if you have any preferences for any future accommodations, I'd like to be informed of those as well so you can be as comfortable as possible during your stay at any Hyatt property.

Wow, I am so sorry you had such a terrible experience at our property.  As a well traveled individual such as yourself must know, if you are dissatisfied with any aspect of your stay in any way, shape, or form, your first form of recourse should always be to express your dissatisfaction to the front desk.   I assure you that whatever your problem was, our front desk staff would have gone to any length to better accommodate your needs and done whatever it took to make you happy. I am deeply sorry that your needs were not met and that we were not provided the opportunity to remedy this for you at any point during your stay.

I normally dive deeper into correspondence with my guests, however per your request, I will not waste any more of your time, and I apologize for what has already gone to waste.  I appreciate your honest opinions and feedback and will share it with the appropriate department heads, also thank you for your time.

Happy holidays.

In the Spirit of Hospitality,

Andrew Monroe

We do our best to convince our guests to follow our mask recommendation, however we unfortunately don't have the security staff on premises to enforce our masking policy very strictly.  If I could control the actions of our guests to that degree, this hotel would be a perfect place.

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this evening to first of all thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests, such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however; based on your response, we have some room for improvement. 

Ms. Freeman, I'm sorry that you feel taken advantage of by the Packers Home Game rates.  Just like anything in the world we live in, if there is a need for a good or service, the greater the demand is for that good or service, the higher the cost will be.  On the topic of our shuttle service, is an inconvenience for everyone not being able to provide shuttle service to our guests, however it has been discontinued with the safety of our guests in mind.  On another note, Ms.  Freeman, I can see from the your post-stay survey that our customer service and food & beverage experience were both a little lackluster for you.  I'd like to know what happened.  If you don't mind sharing any more detailed feedback on how we could have better met and exceeded your expectations in in these regards, I would greatly appreciate it.  Additionally, if you have any preferences for any future accommodations, I'd like to be informed of those as well so you can be as comfortable as possible during your stay at any Hyatt property.

I would like to extend my gratitude for you taking your time to provide your feedback and look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience.  Once again, thank you for your time and your response.

Sincerely,

Thanks for the explanation about the cost of the hotel for Packer games. On
top of the high hotel cost, my Bears lost!
We only experienced the mini Starbucks and had a long wait for coffee.
Overall, we found the staff to be exceptional and friendly. I'm glad your
hotel can stay open during the pandemic and appreciate how you are keeping
your staff safe by canceling the game day shuttle and requiring masks be
worn indoors.
Happy holidays! I will stay there again if I return for a Packers v. Bears
game and hope for a big Bears win!
Jill

Mr. Carle, I do apologize for your less than exceptional dining experience as well as for the fact that the accommodations not being up to your expectations.   Unfortunately, just like so many other businesses, we are having a difficult time finding new talent to bring on board to meet the needs of the business and are still unable to keep the pub open 7 days a week with our current staffing levels.  I am forwarding your comments to my food & beverage team leaders so they will be addressed to the best of our ability.  In regards to the tv in the living room, I'm sorry that it wasn't as large as you would have liked we are hoping to be approved for in room upgrades in the upcoming future.   

I do have one request I'd like to make of you regarding your feedback.  I can see on your survey that you rated our customer service at an extremely low level.  Would you please elaborate on your experience.  What happened that required you to seek customer service from the front desk and what about the service we provided was substandard?  How can we do better in the future? Thank you for going into more detail on this for me.

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

Ms. Johnson, I would like to extend my sincerest apologies for the housekeeping issue you encountered during your most recent stay and also for our property's extended Covid-19 related precautions.  Regarding the housekeeping dilemma.  I am truly sorry.  Not saying that it excuses their behavior whatsoever, but the  entirety of our front desk staff has been brought on board since after the pandemic struck, and are not accustomed to guests requiring housekeeping service during their stay, so I do apologize for the disconnect that had taken place.  It is unacceptable, however, for them to give anyone such a hard time for arranging stayover service, I'm sorry to hear about your experience and will be addressing the matter with the entire desk staff immediately.   In the future, if you encounter any difficulty or inconvenience like that which you experienced, I implore you to please reach out to the Manager on Duty.  This will ensure a swift and thorough resolution be provided in response to your complaint.   Also, regarding our shuttle service, since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, our hotel has suspended shuttle service indefinitely.  I do apologize for the misunderstanding, as it has not been available for well over a year now.  If you can let me know where on the website it still lists the availability of the airport shuttle, I'd appreciate it so I can have that updated.  I can understand how much the frustration you experienced may have negatively impacted your stay with us.  For the inconvenience, I have awarded your World of Hyatt membership account 10,000 points. 

If you have and questions for me or if there is any additional feedback you might have in regards to how we can better meet and exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again thank you for your time and response.

I would like to once again thank you for your feedback and I'm very sorry to hear about your substandard breakfast experience.  My leaders in the Food  & Beverage department have already been forwarded your feedback so I'm hoping we can work on our staffing levels on busy mornings like you experienced.  Unfortunately, like many businesses, we are still struggling to find new talent to get our staffing levels where they need to be in every department in the hotel.  Once we are adequately staffed again, I assure you mornings like the one you mentioned will be a thing of the past. 

Once more, I would like to say thank you for your time and feedback, and I apologize for the negative experience you had with us.  I hope you will consider the Hyatt Regency Green Bay for your lodging needs the next time you're in the Green Bay area.  Happy Holidays!

Sincerely,

Andrew Monroe

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this evening to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Mr. Nufer, I am so sorry to hear about the issues with the sink drain and that you personally dealt with the hair clogging the drain.  If you experience any issues with a hotel room in the future, I implore you, please reach out to the front desk staff.  Let the hotel staff take care of your problems for you.  That's why we're here.  Aside from that issue, it looks like the rest of your stay went rather well.  

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this evening to first of all thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests, such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however; based on your response, we have some room for improvement. 

Ms. Petrie, let me begin by thanking you for your positive feedback and  praise for the front desk and Chester.  The kind words are always appreciated.  However, if all we received was praise, we would never be pushed to improve our performance or grow.  With that in mind, upon reviewing your survey, I did see that we received lower marks from you regarding your experience with our Food & Beverage team and for your World of Hyatt experience.  May I ask, what didn't go as well as you had hoped and where did we fall short of your expectations?  If you can share any more detailed feedback on how we could have better met and exceeded your expectations, I would greatly appreciate it.  Additionally, if you have any preferences for any future accommodations, I'd like to be informed of those as well so you can be as comfortable as possible during your stay at any Hyatt property.

I would like to extend my gratitude for you taking your time to provide your feedback and look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience.  Once again, thank you for your time and your response.

I am reaching out to you this evening to first thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Mrs. Phelan, I would like to extend my apologies for your accommodations not meeting your expectations during your most recent stay at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.  Specifically, I'd like to apologize for your overall room cleanliness issues.  I will be communicating your issues with my housekeeping department so this problem doesn't persist.  I also would like to apologize for the HVAC panel rattling during your first night, I know how much of a negative impact a poor night's sleep can have on an overall traveling experience.  In the future, if your room is not up to your expectations in any way upon arrival, by all means, do not be afraid to reach out to the front desk staff as they are willing and capable to do what is required to take care of our guests and ensure their satisfaction.  However, since you've already checked out and we no longer have the ability to fix the problems for you, and also for any inconvenience you experienced, I have awarded your World of Hyatt membership account 5,000 points. 

On another note, Mrs. Phelan, I see that your scoring of our customer service was lower than any other rating on the survey.  If you don't mind, would you please delve a little deeper into what happened that earned such a low rating?  If you would please provide me with more detailed feedback on our customer service that we provided to you during your stay and how it fell short of your expectations, I would greatly appreciate it.  

If you have and questions for me or if there is any additional feedback you might have in regards to how we can better meet and exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again thank you for your time and response.

Thanks for your e mail.
Regarding customer service:  2 staff at check in merely went through the
check in procedure, no smiles, no welcome, appeared annoyed at having to
walk across lobby to grab water bottles, the next morning when I approached
front desk with a question, the young man was on the phone, more people got
in line....he did not even look up to acknowledge us,,,when he did hang up
he was very curt - both of these experiences can be improved upon.
As far as room concerns, I did contact staff regarding light bulbs and dead
phone battery and someone did come to take care of, unfortunately we did
not notice the rattling of the HVAC vent until we we quietly trying to fall
asleep,
Hopefully I answered your questions.  Thanks for the Hyatt points to my
account.

Thank you so much for diving deeper into your experience for me.  I'll use this feedback directly to correct the behavior of the agent you mentioned.  Thank you for letting me know about this.

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Mr. Jennings, I do apologize that you were caught off-guard by our restaurant being closed during your stay.  We, like many businesses, are so short staffed that we are unable to remain open during all desired hours of operation.  Though we are normally open in our Pub Monday-Saturday evenings, due to special circumstances, we did not have the staffing availability to be open on the night of December 1st.  I am sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you.  In respect to our corporate mask policy, I am sorry that your personal beliefs do not align with our precautionary measures for the safety of our guests.  It is Hyatt's purpose that, ""We care for people so they can be their best,""  and with this in mind, we adhere to the CDC's current masking guidelines which state, ""If you are fully vaccinated, to maximize protection and prevent possibly spreading COVID-19 to others, wear a mask indoors in public if you are in an area of substantial or high transmission.""  Green Bay is currently listed as an area of high transmission, so until conditions change, we will take every measure to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all of our guests.  

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

Additionally, if you have any preferences for any future accommodations, I'd like to be informed of those as well so you can be as comfortable as possible during your stay at any Hyatt property.

I'm also sorry to hear about your problems with the microwave, nobody likes burnt popcorn!  In regards to your maintenance concerns, thank you for bringing this to our attention so we can fix the problem.  I hope it wasn't too much of a nuisance for you during your stay.  I'll also be communicating the concerns about room cleanliness to my Housekeeping Leadership Team.  There is no excuse for there to be any evidence of the previous guest to remain after housekeeping has cleaned the room.  I'm sorry we fell short of your expectations for us.  On another note, I do have one request to ask of you, though.  The next time that you're with us, I invite you to please reach out to the  front desk staff if you experience any degree of inconvenience.  We pride ourselves on our customer service and we are willing to go above and beyond when it comes to taking care of our guests.

I again would like to apologize for the fact that you couldn't use your heater in your room during your recent stay.  I didn't realize that it was such a nuisance.  I would again like to reiterate that if you have any problems of this nature during your stay, please reach out to the front desk.  There is no reason any one aspect of your guest room should not be in full working order.  Unfortunately there is nothing I can do about it now, but had you communicated the issue to us, we would have made it right for you either by fixing the problem, reassigning your room to one in full  working order, or otherwise gone above and beyond to compensate for your experience.  We're here to take care of you, remember that.  

As an act of goodwill, since you weren't able to use the heater in the room and for how frigid it can get here in Green Bay, I am issuing 3,000 World of Hyatt points to your account this morning.  This is enough, when combined with your current points balance, to redeem for a 1-night stay in one of our standard suites here at the Hyatt Regency Green bay.  I hope this will alleviate some of your disappointment and frustration from your recent stay.  

If you have any questions for would like to submit any additional feedback, feel free to reach out to me directly.   As always, thank you for your time and for your feedback.

I am reaching out to you this morning to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience.

Mr. Priest,  I sincerely apologize for the substandard level of service you received during check-in for your stay.  There really is no excuse for what had taken place .  Our guests are always our first priority and again, I'm sorry that several of our colleagues appear to have forgotten about that.  I'll be sure to have a chat with my front desk agents about that immediately.  I'm also sorry that your group had several issues with your room keys, we don't often experience many issues, if any at all, with our room keys or the encoder, but I do apologize that whatever happened had affected you personally.  I understand how frustrating it can be after traveling for so long to want to just get into your hotel room and decompress.  I'm sorry you were delayed in that.  I would also like to say that we're sorry for the state of your guest room upon your arrival, I'd be quite upset as well.  On your next visit, however, if you encounter the slightest bit of inconvenience, I invite you to please reach out to our Manager on Duty with your problems and I guarantee that they'll go to the ends of the Earth to make it right for you.  

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience.. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement.
Mr. Priest,  I sincerely apologize for the substandard level of service you received during check-in for your stay.  There really is no excuse for what had taken place .  Our guests are always our first priority and again, I'm sorry that several of our colleagues appear to have forgotten about that.  I'll be sure to have a chat with my front desk agents about that immediately.  I'm also sorry that your group had several issues with your room keys, we don't often experience many issues, if any at all, with our room keys or the encoder, but I do apologize that whatever happened had affected you personally.  I understand how frustrating it can be after traveling for so long to want to just get into your hotel room and decompress.  I'm sorry you were delayed in that.  I would also like to say that we're sorry for the state of your guest room upon your arrival, I'd be quite upset as well.  On your next visit, however, if you encounter the slightest bit of inconvenience, I invite you to please reach out to our Manager on Duty with your problems and I guarantee that they'll go to the ends of the Earth to make it right for you.
If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.
Sincerely,
Andrew Monroe

If you plan on traveling to the Green Bay area on a regular basis, I recommend getting in touch with our sales team to potentially establish a preferred corporate rate with us.  If you contact the hotel directly at 920-432-1234, you can speak with our Sales Systems Admin Cassiana and she'd be more than happy to get the ball rolling for you with that.  

If you have any questions or would like to provide any additional feedback, please feel free to reach out to me directly.

Happy Holidays,

2021-12-05 19:54:43] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good Evening, Ms. Draves, 

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this evening to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Ms. Draves, I would like to apologize for your less than exceptional experience during your most recent stay with us.  In regards to room upgrades for our World of Hyatt elite members, upgrades are given based on availability.  With the room type that you booked, there are a limited number of rooms that are above that to upgrade you to.  I apologize that we weren't able to provide you with an upgrade during this stay.  I am also sorry about your experience with our front desk when you requested a blanket.  I will be certain to have a conversation with my front desk staff regarding their communication with guests and using proper wording.  Of course we would have been able to acquire a blanket per your request and I'm sorry you were left feeling as though there was a chance that we wouldn't take care of your needs.  Anything less than the best would not be up to the standard of care that we pride ourselves on providing to our guests.  

I would also like to clear up any confusion that you may have in reference to our parking charges.  I did look back and it appears that the front desk had overlooked charging your reservations for parking on 2 of your 3 stays with us over the last 5 years.  Our repeated errors had apparently worked out in your favor as you didn't get charged for parking.  It is hotel policy that any guest with a vehicle in our surface lot is to be charged $10 per night.  The only exception is when a guest books at a negotiated/contracted rate where parking is included in the rate or when you achieve Globalist status within World of Hyatt and are redeeming points for your stay.  Other than those instances, parking is a standard fee for all of our guests parking a vehicle on property.  I apologize for our past errors leading you to believe that parking fees were not standard, but at least our errors ended up being to your benefit in the end.

As for our policy on face coverings, it is Hyatt's purpose that, ""We care for people so they can be their best,"" and our masking policy is in place to do just that.  At Hyatt, we take into consideration the most current guidelines laid down by the CDC  while we are amidst this pandemic. As of right now, the CDC recommends that even fully vaccinated individuals, ""Wear a mask indoors in public if they are in an area of substantial or high transmission.""  Currently, the Green Bay area is labeled as an area of high transmission and thus we ask that our guests respect the safety and wellbeing of others and mask up while in the public areas of the hotel.  With that being said, I am glad to know you've been lucky to have not contracted the virus while in such close proximity to the infected and would like to thank you for all that you do as an ER nurse.

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations n the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

Sincerely,

Andrew Monroe

Every request was responded to with a snide tone of voice. I said we were checking in and gave my husbands name his response was “ well then I would need HIS ID” as if He didn’t want anything to do with me. I would think the proper response would be “Welcome!, I just need to see an ID and credit card to get you checked in”  He made us feel VERY unwelcome by the manner in which he communicated. Soon after came down to request a knife to cut an apple, to which he responded that they don’t have knives behind the desk( obviously, but should be his job to try to accommodate and think of solutions to simple requests). So we asked if he could ask someone at the restaurant and he said he would ask and send it up and we never got a response. When we left, he saw us and literally turned his back. Again I would think it is protocol to say good bye and thank you as the guests leave the property. I hope that he is new and just needs some coaching or training but if he is there when we stay again, I would think twice about staying there again. Last thing we were disappointed that the pool doesn’t open until 10am.

 Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Rebecca Schroeder and I am  the Assistant Director of Operations for our rooms division here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assist us in improving our overall customer service. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing authentic service and clean comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. Mr. Lenz-Perkins, I do apologize for the issues in your guestroom bathroom that you encountered during your most recent stay and for being charged for parking! You were absolutely correct that on an award night, as a globalist you do get free parking, I have refunded your card for the parking and I apologize for this mishap and  for the inconvenience.  If there is any additional feedback in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in the future please feel free to reach out to me directly. Once again thank you for your response.


Sincerely,

Rebecca Schroeder

First of all, thank you for being our guest. We greatly appreciate your business. Also, thank  you for your feedback, it is feedback like yours that enables us to provide better customer service to our guests.  I do want to apologize that you were not able to get a response about your billing questions.  I have looked into your folio and would like to let you know that we did only charge your card the 1 payment of $494.31.  Any authorizations that were taken should have fallen off by now so please try to take another look. I hope this is resolved. If not or If I can be of any further assistance please reach out to me.

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this evening to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Mr. Zimdars, I do that our facilities are not up to your standards.  If I'm not mistaken we are slated for a welcomed round of in-room upgrades to our property in the foreseeable future.  I would also like to sincerely apologize for Ryan and your experience with him.  He has since been relieved of his duties at the front desk and will not be returning to them.   With this taken in consideration, we hope you will give us the opportunity to serve you as our guest again in the future.

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

I am reaching out to you this evening to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey.

Ms. Woo, I do apologize for the long wait you endured for breakfast.   I know how upset I would be if I were in your shoes and had to rearrange my plans for the entire day like that, let's just say I would be less than pleased as I'm sure you are.   I apologize also for the cleanliness of your room, once housekeeping is done cleaning a guest room after departure, there should be absolutely no evidence of the previous guest present whatsoever.  The fact that there was refuse left in your room is unacceptable.  I also want to apologize that our housekeeping staff missed the stains on your bedding, those should have been spotted and pulled back to laundry.  I do apologize for our failure to catch them.  Ms. Woo, for your long wait at breakfast and for the cleanliness of your guest room, I'm awarding your World of Hyatt account with 3,000 bonus points for the inconvenience you experienced.  I hope they reach you well.

In the future, if you come across any issues whatsoever during your stay at any Hyatt property, I invite you to reach out to us while your here so we can fix the problem for you.  Our staff is very capable of resolving any issues our guests may encounter.  

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

I am reaching out to you this morning to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Mr. Schmidt, I'm sorry to hear that you weren't able to enjoy the full experience while staying with us.  Though you may not know, our restaurant is normally closed on Sunday nights, but we opened up for our standard hours of operation just for the Packers home game.  Though you said you would be planning on booking elsewhere for your next Packers experience here in Green Bay, I hope you'll give us another opportunity to serve you.  To give you a little motivation to try us out again and to make up for your not getting the total package this last time, I've taken the liberty of awarding your World of Hyatt account with 5,000 points.  You can use these points as either a $25 dining credit, or it can be used along with some of your existing points balance for one free night here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay or any Hyatt of the same tier world-wide.  After this, I do hope we'll see you around again.

On a related note, Mr. Schmidt, I see you also rated your experience at breakfast at a 0 out of 10.  If you wouldn't mind could you please elaborate on what we did that earned such a low score?  Any more detailed feedback you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

So if you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Ms. Lendved, I do apologize that the height of our beds made it difficult for you to get in them, but I do hope you were able to enjoy just how comfortable they are.  I have heard that many times about the height of our toilets being too low, and I totally agree.  If I've been informed correctly, we are due for some in-room renovations in the future and I believe that will be on the list of upgrades.  In respect to the World of Hyatt program, I'm not sure how this would have happened but one of our agents appears to have enrolled you in the program, I am so sorry if that was not what you wished.  If you wish to delete the account please let me know and I'll reach out to World of Hyatt and see if I am able to facilitate that for you.  I do apologize again for enrolling you without your consent if that was the case.  On the bright side of things, you have already earned enough points to redeem a $10 credit in any Hyatt dining outlet if you wish to keep the account and the points never expire as long as the account is active. 

On another note, Ms. Lendved, I do see a couple causes for concern from your survey response other than what was already touched on.  It appears that your experience with our Food & Beverage team was, to be blunt, absolutely terrible.  Would you please fill me in on what had taken place to earn such a low score?  Also receiving a less than exceptional score was your rating of our customer service provided during your stay.  If you could provide me with more detailed feedback on just what went wrong and how we fell short of your expectations, I'd greatly appreciate it.  Additionally, if you have any specific preferences for future stays that you'd like to communicate to me, I would gladly note it on your profile so you'll be as comfortable as possible while staying at any Hyatt property world-wide in the future.

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

2021-11-30 11:35:44] Email received from: Kristine Lendved <klendved@cable.wislib.org>: Dear Mr. Monroe...
Why, thanks...I am grateful for your follow-up!
Very pleased to hear your toilet height is due to be re-sized. I would think that many people will appreciate that!
And, yes, the beds, once in them, were comfortable. And beautifully made, with quilt tucked between the sheets. But, yeah, hard to get in and out of. I would remind you that people sometimes people sit on a bed as part of the dressing process. With there, also, being no chair in the room, there was no good spot to prop oneself. (since beds too high to be able to seat oneself on them.) 
If I made a complaint about customer service, I must've hit the wrong button. It was fine. Certainly no negatives!
The food...well, perhaps I make an assumption I should not when I assume the Hyatt does the catering for the KI Center. I was there as an attendee of the Wisconsin Library Assn Conference and, thus, ate 3 lunches there, from uninspiring to truly dreadful. If I am wrong about Hyatt catering KI events, please accept my apology on that score. Another day I went to your little ""store"" for more caffeine and some breakfast...and walked away, after waiting 15 minutes, for what turned out to be burned coffee and a dry muffin. The last time I attended a library conference at the same location, I seem to recall the food was tremendous. 
The World of Hyatt thing...I have a vague memory of something about that from a wedding I attended in Chicago some years ago...So, it may date from that time...and your customer service certainly made no mistake in checking status on that, etc.
I lived in Green Bay for a number of years, so, usually when I visit the city I stay with friends! But, this time, appreciated the convenience of proximity to the conference...and also the reasonable room rate for a suite. If I found myself in need of a place to stay, I would absolutely consider the Hyatt. I think that it's quite attractive, well-located and comfortable. 
Cheers and best,
Kristine Lendved

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Mr. Perl, I do apologize for the fact that we are still only able to provide limited housekeeping service currently.  It boils down to several factors.  First we are still working at maintaining social distancing, as we are still in the midst of a pandemic and the safety of our guests and colleagues is our first priority.  At the same time, just like so many other businesses right now, we have not been able to get our staffing levels to where they need to be if we would even hope to be able to provide daily service to all of our guests.  Though it may have been a slower day, if we wished to provide regular housekeeping as we did before the pandemic hit, our room attendants that we do have, would all have to be working 7 days a week and I can only imagine how  many hours every day they'd have to be here just to finish that heavy of a workload.  Our room attendants, on an average day, currently have to clean 15 or more guest suites.  Some of those suites can take up to an hour due to the degree of consideration many people lack based on the state they leave their rooms in.   I hope you are better able to understand why we yet have limited housekeeping services.  

On another note, Mr. Perl, I can see from your feedback that your experience with our Customer Service as well as our Food & Beverage and Breakfast teams all failed to hit the mark.  If you can provide me with any additional feedback as to what went wrong or where we fell short of your expectations, I'd greatly appreciate it. 

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

2021-12-01 09:04:08] Email received from: David Perl <drjperl@gmail.com>: Good morning Andrew,
I am adding answers to your questions below, but let me start with the fact
that I completely understand that we are living in a challenging time, and
bringing on and keeping good employees without a pandemic is difficult at
best. I have no doubt that the drop in service capabilities you are
suffering are on par with other hotels in the area. I also believe honest
feedback is the best way to know where you are and where you need to focus
to improve.
As a guest, I don't get to see the drama unfolding in the back office, but
that is a good thing. I did provide feedback based on my
long-term expectations of your brand as I find that to be more helpful in
my own business to understand how we are recovering from the past couple of
years.
General Cleanliness: Main areas were clean, but corners had collected
dust/dirt, and some surfaces were sticky. Banisters were really dusty. Not
Earth-shattering, but cleanliness issues like this often lead to
second-guessing the trust we place in food safety, etc.
Limited Housekeeping: I have no view of the rooms that had not been cleaned
yet from previous days etc. I did see staff there, but I did not see them
not working. Sory for the double negative, but my point is that they were
busy. My initial assessment was based on the nearly empty parking lot when
we arrived Tuesday night and not being more than 30% full until Friday. I
had not allowed for a backlog of work to be completed.
Front Desk: Outstanding. Good ambassadors for your brand. They were very
respectful, helpful, and efficient.
Breakfast dining: This is an area you may want to focus your customer
service efforts. My family and I were greeted with eye rolls a couple of
mornings. The server we had multiple days was clearly unhappy with her job
and while not specifically rude, she did speak to us tersely. It was enough
for my 8-year-old daughter to ask me why the server was so grumpy. I was a
server while in college and know how taxing that job can be. I did tip her
well as I do all service staff because I know they got hit the hardest with
COVID.
Finally, not on your survey but an area that needs to be addressed. The
tile floor around the pool was not level or draining so areas were always
wet and quite slippery. I did not see anyone fall, but I did see several
people slip and catch themselves when walking on the hotel side of the pool.
Reach out if you have any additional questions.
Thank you,
Dave Perl

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Ms. Rae, I would like to begin by apologizing that our performance failed to live up to and exceed your expecations.  Just like so many other businesses right now, we are also finding great difficulty in not only finding the new talent,  but also retaining and properly training what few individuals we've been able to find thus far.  It has been a nightmare and we are pulling individuals from almost every department to help in the Market so the girls don't have to be alone when it's busy.  Staffing right now has been an absolute nightmare.  I'm sorry that it negatively impacted your stay with us.  

Ms. Rae, I can also conclude from your survey responses that our Food & Beverage department, more specifically, our breakfast team both failed to hit the mark, so to say.  If you wouldn't mind providing some more detailed feedback as to just what went wrong for you, I'd greatly appreciate it.  

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

No worries from me at all. I really did enjoy my stay in Green Bay. My only feedback was more help in the Market. The morning coffee line was so long and I do understand staffing issues.
One comment that I didn't make, but I should have is that I ordered the vegetarian option at each of our luncheons and I was never disappointed. This is a rare thing for conference meals...the staff that you have is doing a great job.
Thank you,
Gina Rae

Thank you again for your additional feedback, your kind words are GREATLY appreciated.  Far too often I feel people forget that these surveys are a great way to recognize the positive aspects of one's stay along with the negatives.  I have forwarded your reply to my Food & Beverage team leaders to share the positive feedback and also to address staffing concerns for the Market as well.  Thank you again for your time and for your feedback.

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to first of all thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests, such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however; based on your response, we have some room for improvement. 

Ms. Sorrentino, I can see from your survey response that you had a less than favorable experience in respect to our Food & Beverage department.  If you can share any more detailed feedback on how we could have better met and exceeded your expectations, I would greatly appreciate it.  Additionally, if you have any preferences for any future accommodations, I'd like to be informed of those as well so you can be as comfortable as possible during your stay at any Hyatt property.

I would like to extend my gratitude for you taking your time to provide your feedback and look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience.  Once again, thank you for your time and your response.

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Ms. Schnupp, I do so deeply apologize that your disappointing experience with our Food & Beverage department failed to meet your expectations for us to say the least.  Being in the hospitality industry, it's literally our job to serve others.  Our guests are our livelihood and there is absolutely no excuse for the bar staff to be anything less than the hospitable as you've described in your feedback and I'm sorry you had to experience that.  Though I can't change what had happened for you, I can assure your that your feedback will not fall on dead ears and has been forwarded to the proper individuals so it can be taken into consideration for the future.  We are always striving to improve ourselves and our operation every day.  With your feedback, I feel we are headed in the right direction.  Thank you for bringing these points our attention.  I would also like to say I am glad to know that the rest of your stay appears to have gone far better for you overall.

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

Sincerely,

I truly appreciate your response. You have a beautiful hotel. I don't give
bad reviews on social media; I prefer to reply to surveys and contact
managers directly. It gives everyone an opportunity to make changes if the
opinion or complaint is found to warrant one. So I do appreciate your
email, and I wish you well.
Best regards,
Joy

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Mr. Suchoki, I would like to again apologize for the cleanliness of your room and what was found in the couch.  There is no excuse for any evidence of a previous guest being found in a room after our housekeeping staff has cleaned it, especially nothing of such an intimate nature.  I do recall this situation and I'm glad that our customer service lived up to your expectations and that we were able to make concessions to pick up the slack where our housekeeping staff fell short.  Thank you again for providing us with the opportunity to make the situation right for you. 

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Ms. Carello, I do apologize we were unable to provide you with an upgrade during your stay as those are given based on availability and at check-in, unfortunately, the room types available to upgrade you to were all unavailable or not ready to be rented.  I am glad to hear that our server provided such an excellent breakfast experience for you during you stay.  I've already copied the supervisor from that department on this feedback so your praise will not go unheard.  As for our Globalists, we are currently working on revamping our Globalist experience, as I was just having a conversation with our new Front Office Manager about that exact need that we have at our property,  So it's funny you should bring that up.  I assure you, the Globalist experience will soon be at the level it's supposed to be at with a Hyatt hotel.  Lastly, I'm absolutely delighted to hear that though you encountered further difficulties during your stay, that our staff handled them promptly and efficiently.  That's wonderful to hear, thank you for sharing that.  

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

Sincerely,

Andrew Monroe

I will make sure to have a conversation with her the next time I see her.  I do so apologize that she misinformed you.  For the inconvenience and for your having to go light on your breakfast, I've taken the liberty of awarding your World of Hyatt account 2,000 points.

If you can share any more detailed feedback on how we could have better met and exceeded your expectations, I would greatly appreciate it.  Additionally, if you have any preferences for any future accommodations, I'd like to be informed of those as well so you can be as comfortable as possible during your stay at any Hyatt property.

2021-11-26 22:04:57] Email received from: Joe Reimers <omgjonx@gmail.com>: Hello Andrew,
Thanks for reaching out. Please bear in mind that it's been awhile since
I've traveled, and a certain measure of adjusting to the ""new normal"" has
to be taken into account.
I appreciated the ready availability of masks and hand sanitizer. And while
I recognize the ""new normal"" does not permit a daily servicing of the room,
an option for a ""light"" servicing - or even a trash pickup - would be
appreciated. In retrospect, I probably could have called the front desk,
but I was there for a conference and out of my room for a good chunk of the
day. I did take some meals in my room, however, and that caused trash and
recycle to fill rather quickly.
Additionally - and this is a very minor thing, except when it's not - I
found it very difficult to find a place where I could set up the ironing
board close enough to an outlet to be able to iron. The cords on the
in-room irons are extremely short and the open spaces are quite far from
open outlets.
I don't want to give the impression that I'm a complainer. I've stayed at
several Hyatt properties previously, and have come to expect a certain
standard from Hyatt. The Hyatt Regency Green Bay is certainly a nice hotel
and met my standards for hotel room cleanliness and comfort, but seemed
more in line with an Embassy Suites than a Hyatt Regency. I wasn't
displeased or dissatisfied. My demands aren't all that demanding, and if
things truly were subpar, I would have expressed such at the time. Truth be
told, I've been a (voluntary) return visitor to hotels that aren't as nice
as yours. I just don't often hand out ""exceptional"" scores. Those require
an extra ""something"" that stands out, that is truly memorable, that is
somehow above and beyond. I didn't really give your staff that much
opportunity to be exceptional. Please rest assured that should I find
myself in Green Bay again, I will keep the Hyatt Regency Green Bay on my
short list of hotels.

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to first of all thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests, such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however; based on your response, we have some room for improvement. 

Ms. Carollo, I'd first like to sincerely apologize for our failing to hit the mark on accommodating your special requests.  There is no excuse for that getting overlooked, especially since, as I can see, you had requested it at the time of reservation.  I'm glad to know that Scott handled the matter professionally and promptly once it was brought to his attention.  Unfortunately, we've had several new additions at the front desk and that of course means weeks of training for so many specific issues that may arise and it appears one that they had not yet encountered was a request for a quiet room.  I'll be sure to touch base with the staff that a quiet room most certainly means a room that is not on the street facing wall of the hotel.  I apologize for our failure to prepare for that request.  

On another note, I see that the score you gave to our Food & Beverage team as well as for your check-in experience were also very low.  My question for you is this, what went wrong?   Was there anything in particular that you believe we need to improve upon?  Is there anything that just went absolutely terrible for you? If you can share any more detailed feedback on how we could have better met and exceeded your expectations, I would greatly appreciate it.  Additionally, if you have any preferences for any future accommodations, I'd like to be informed of those as well so you can be as comfortable as possible during your stay at any Hyatt property.

I would like to extend my gratitude for you taking your time to provide your feedback and look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience.  Once again, thank you for your time and your response.

2021-11-24 12:08:52] Email received from: Melissa Carollo <mcarollo@sunlib.org>: Hello, Andrew,
Thank you for reaching out. My dining experience was limited to the coffee shop in the lobby (which was great, the woman staffing it was patient and kind) and the restaurant. In my single interaction at the restaurant, my companion and I waited for 40 minutes before contacting another server to ask that our meal be boxed instead of plated since we both had meetings to attend. We weren't told specifically, but I believe our order was perhaps not submitted to the kitchen. We both received complimentary meals, which I felt was an appropriate action on that front. The specific requests we had (no red onions on the burger, and no croutons on the salad) were ignored, but honestly, easily picked off.
Thank you!

I'm so sorry to hear about the not-so-savory experience you had with our team in Pub 333.  I've forwarded your feedback directly to the Director of Food & Beverage along with the other team leaders in that department.  I'm glad to know that they at least provided an adequate recovery to account for the delayed order.  Thank you for the positive feedback on the Market employee.  Though all of the ladies are still pretty new in there, they are doing a great job.

I'd once again like to express my gratitude for you taking your time to provide us with feedback so we can continue to grow and improve.

In the spirit of hospitality,

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Ms. Massengill, I do apologize that you were in a room without a desk and chair in it and needed one.  We have plenty of rooms that would have accommodated your needs and would have made the arrangements for you had we known of them.  For any future instance where you have a need not being met with your accommodations, I invite you to reach out to the Front Desk staff as they will do anything and everything within their power and ability to take care of our guests.  On another note, thank you for informing me about the carpet rippling in your room, many times our engineering department goes unaware of room issues until someone speaks up about them.  Your feedback has already been shared with the Engineering department and they will be addressing your concern.  

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

2021-11-23 07:43:57] Email received from: Jeri Massengill <jerim@historicalinfo.com>: Thanks for responding Andrew, I am impressed!  I am a business owner so that is why I submit honest reviews; I would want to know if it was my business.  I did try calling the front desk a couple times, but got no answer, I guess because they were already helping others.  I could have waited in line at the front desk to ask for a room change or different furniture, but did not, so I take the blame for that.  I just found the furniture and lighting in the room to be odd and somewhat non-functional for a business traveler, so thought I would mention it. Honestly, the room I was in looked like it was set up for a 1980s bachelor party 😊
Best, Jeri Massengill

I can completely understand not wanting to wait in the line at the front desk for a minor issue and I'd like to apologize for the front desk staff missing your call. We are still trying to get our staffing levels up to where they need to be in all departments, just like so many other businesses right now. I'm sorry that our being short-staffed caused us to miss the opportunity to wow you with our customer service, I really am. Upon receiving your email, I was at the time unfamiliar that the room you were in was any different than the others of the same type, and I immediately went up to see what you meant. I can clearly see what you mean about the styling and the lack of functionality for a business traveler. I'll be bringing up your comments to my superior the next time I see her. Thank you again for your time and insightful feedback, it is much appreciated!

I am reaching out to you this morning to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Mr. Hoffman, I do apologize for the cleanliness of your room, specifically behind and underneath your bed.  Though those are areas that a guest doesn't normally encounter, housekeeping should be ensuring that any and all evidence of the previous guest is removed from the room prior to another guest occupying it.  I'll be sharing this information with our Room Inspectors and reminding them to be double checking underneath and behind the beds during their room inspections so this does not occur for future guests.  With regards to your lost & found item, I apologize that it took just under an hour to return your lost item to you.  Thankfully it was returned prior to your departure and wasn't lost for good.  I'm also sorry to hear about the quality of your meal at Pub 333.  If this ever occurs again, I recommend saying something to your server right away.  That not only gives the restaurant the opportunity to prepare something more to your liking, but also many times, after speaking to a manager, many restaurants will also comp your meal or make some concession for your inconvenience.  I am glad, however, to hear that we recovered from that failure during breakfast.  

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

I only gave a less than stellar mark for the food based on the limited
menu. The food itself was good and the service was excellent. I hesitated
about that mark as I know that all service locations are struggling to
hire, train and retain staff but wanted to be honest about my experience.
Thanks for responding so quickly,

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to first of all thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests, such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however; based on your response, we have some room for improvement. 

Ms. Nichols, I'd first like to apologize for your experience at the front desk regarding a 2 card transaction.  We have several recent additions to our team at the front desk and unfortunately you can only train for so many scenarios as there is a never-ending supply of potential issues that come up on the job.  I'll be sure to go over with the front desk staff how to properly process payment with 2 cards.  With regards to the burnt out lights in the room, I'm sorry that our rooms inspector overlooked checking those lights in the room during her inspection, I'll be touching base with our housekeeping team to check this in the future.  Thank you for shedding light on those issues.

If you don't mind, I have a couple of questions for you regarding the scores you gave and the reasons why.  I see that your worst experiences were with our customer service and your experience at check-in.  Was there anything that occurred other than the issue regarding 2 credit cards for payment that made this experience so distasteful for you?  I can see that you also gave us a low score for our Food & Beverage team, specifically for your experience at breakfast.  Is there any additional feedback you can provide as to what you felt could have been better?  If you can share any more detailed feedback on how we could have better met and exceeded your expectations on these topics or in any other ways, I would greatly appreciate it.  Additionally, if you have any preferences for any future accommodations, I'd like to be informed of those as well so you can be as comfortable as possible during your stay at any Hyatt property.

I would like to extend my gratitude for you taking your time to provide your feedback and look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience.  Once again, thank you for your time and your response.

I appreciate your quick response. I usually don't both with surveys, but because I had such a positive experience with all your staff (now including you), I felt it was worth mentioning. It's an easy fix and really would leave a much different impression of your hotel if it was remedied. I'm surprised anyone let it get this bad.
Thanks for taking time to address my concerns.

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this evening to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Ms. Norcini, I do apologize for your less than hospitable experience with our Food & Beverage department.  We are doing our best to attract new talent as we are short-staffed in almost every department.  Just like so many other businesses right now, we are having a difficult time finding anyone whatsoever to fill these open positions.  We are doing the best we can with what staff we do have, and are open as much as staffing allows, though quite often we are running with a skeleton crew.  I'm sorry to hear that you were unable to dine with us on the day of the game.  I would also like to apologize for our breakfast staff not being present when you needed them on Monday morning, their performance was unacceptable.  I have forwarded your feedback to our Food & Beverage team leaders and can ensure that this issue will be addressed immediately.  I would also like to let you know that our Market is open 24 hours a day and we offer several breakfast items such as muffins, fruit & yogurt parfaits, fresh fruit, along with other fresh food items.  Once more, I do sincerely apologize for your subpar experience with our Food & Beverage team.

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

Mr. Tullio, I do apologize for the overall cleanliness of your room falling short of your expectations for us.  You're absolutely correct, the staffing shortage has had a clear and direct impact on us and our performance as a whole.  I am glad to know that though we may have dropped the ball in a couple ways, our recovery was above and beyond what you had expected.  That is the kind of customer service that we strive for.  I'm also glad to hear your praise of our front desk and food & beverage team, we have been working diligently these last several months as we have been slowly recovering from our staffing shortage and the difficulties it has presented us with to build a stronger team than we had previously known.  Thank you for the compliments.

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to first thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Ms. Merfeld, I would like to extend my sincerest apologies for the reservations issue you encountered upon your recent trip to Green Bay.  I am beyond sorry for the stress this must have caused you.  I know this must have made what was supposed to have been a fun-filled weekend turn out to be not so enjoyable at all.  For the inconvenience, I know we had offered free breakfast from our restaurant every day of your stay and removed the parking fees for you, but I feel we can do more for you.   I know you said you will no longer trust Hyatt with your future vacation plans, but I invite you to give us another chance.  I have awarded your World of Hyatt membership account 16,000 points, which is the equivalence of 2 nights in a standard suite at a Hyatt in the same tier as the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

If you have and questions for me or if there is any more additional feedback you might have in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again thank you for your time and response.

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to first of all thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests, such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however; based on your response, we have room for improvement. 

As you are aware, the average rate for a hotel room in Green Bay on Packers home-game days can be anywhere from $250 if you book early, up to as much as $700 per night before taxes.  There have been times when properties that nowhere near rival our accommodations have charged as much as $300+ per night.  It's simply a case of supply and demand when it comes to the going rate for a hotel room when the Packers are playing at Lambeau Field, but I am sorry to know that the value of our property isn't apparent especially during a special event weekend, where the supply of rooms with the amenities that we offer is so limited.  It's thanks to feedback from our guests such as yourself that we are able to improve and increase the perceived value of what we have to offer.  

On another note, Mr. Robinson, If you care to share any more detailed feedback on how we could have better met and exceeded your expectations in regards our accommodations and what you believe is in need of updating, I would greatly appreciate it.  At the same time, Mr. Robinson, it appears that your experience during breakfast and in general with our Food & Beverage team was less than exceptional.   If you can provide any details on how we fell short of your expectations so we can improve for the future, it would also be appreciated.  Additionally, if you have any preferences for any future accommodations, I'd like to be informed of those as well so you can be as comfortable as possible during your stay at any Hyatt property.

I would like to extend my gratitude for you taking your time to provide your feedback and look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience.  Once again, thank you for your time and your response.

It is Hyatt's purpose that ""We care for people so they can be their best,"" and during the current times we are taking whatever measures necessary to keep our guests safe while they're with us.  On another note, I can see from your survey response that your experience with our Food & Beverage department, specifically your experience at breakfast, fell short of what you had expected of us.

It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Mr. Schimming, I do apologize for the less than hospitable experience that you had with our breakfast staff.  I know how much of an impact the start of one's morning can have on one's entire day, and I'm extremely sorry that we started your day(s) off so poorly.  I have forwarded your feedback to the leadership team in our Food & Beverage department and will be following up with Jesse to determine exactly who it was that provided you with your experience.  Thanks to your feedback, we will address this issue and hopefully prevent it from reoccurring for future guests.  Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback that you wish to provide in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

Sincerely,

Andrew Monroe

You have my deepest sympathies for the discomfort this must have caused you.  I can understand how much something like this can negatively impact your stay while visiting Green Bay, especially .  For the inconvenience during your vacation, I have awarded your World of Hyatt membership account 4,000 points as a token of our apology. 

If you have and questions for me or if there is any additional feedback you might have in regards to how we can better exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again thank you for your time and response.

Thank you for the points but more for your response.
I travel (pre-covid) nights per year on average.
 So I have a pretty good understanding of what travel on the road is all
about.
Especially hotel overnights and what a person of my gender and age are
looking for that hotel to provide.
Sincerly,
JC Strand

Ms. Schneider, I do apologize for the inconsistency of your shower temperature.  I'm sure that was very uncomfortable if not frustrating to deal with.  I also wish to apologize for the cleanliness of the shower/tub and the grout cleaning/replacement will be addressed as soon as the room is vacant again.   Thank you for  making us aware of these issues as without your feedback we'd be left unaware.  I believe the issue regarding the parking receipts has already been addressed internally, however; if you yet need a printout of your receipt please feel free to let me know and I can produce one for you with a little more information.  

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback you wish to provide in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

Mr. Tschohl, I do apologize for the condition of your room.  I know the difference that a decent mattress can make for your night's sleep and I'm sorry to know that the sofa bed was missing those springs.  I see that when you reached out to the front desk they were able to provide you with new accommodations that were more suitable as well as comping your parking charges for you for the inconvenience of having to move rooms.  Thank you for providing your feedback immediately and allowing us the opportunity to remedy the problem.

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Mr. Tlusty, I do apologize for the fact that one of the TV's in the room did not work for you.  After looking further into it, I do see that you reported the issue to the front desk but declined having our Engineering staff fix the problem for you.  On an unrelated note I'm glad to know that you appreciate our Covid-19 measures  in place throughout the property.  It is Hyatt's purpose that ""We care for people so they can be their best,"" and throughout the duration of this pandemic, we will do our best to do just that.  Our safety measures we have in place due to Covid-19 will remain there so long as there is a need for them.  Mr. Tlusty, upon reviewing your other survey responses, I am seeing that you had a less than favorable overall breakfast experience.  If you don't mind, could you please elaborate on where we fell short of your expectations and what you think we need to improve upon?  I would greatly appreciate it.

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback you wish to provide in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in any other way in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience and once again, thank you for your time and response.

I choose not to have the TV fixed because I have to be overly cautious regarding Covid concerns.  The other TV worked, which was sufficient.  As for breakfast, a number of people had trouble first being seated and second delays in  having their order taken.   Again, the Covid safety measures were greatly appreciated.    Jay Tlusty

Please feel free to call me if you want me to expound on what I thought was a lackluster experience on the whole; however, please know that my comments about the fax experience referenced one of the few positive experiences I had at the hotel. I’m hoping whoever assisted me with the urgent fax need (I’m sorry: I don’t remember her name) receives positive recognition; she was very helpful with an extra-ordinary need. She assisted me at/from the front desk last Thursday evening around 8 or 9pm. Will

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience.

Mrs. Weber, I do apologize for the uncomfortable temperature levels in your room as well as for finding a previous guest's item in your room.  I t is upsetting that the Front Desk did not take care of your room temperature problem more effectively, I will communicate with them additional steps they need to be taking when this issue arises.  Regarding the tissue you found under the bed, it is unacceptable to find previous guest's items in your room, and as for the nature of the item, I am truly sorry.  I will be sure to pass along this information to my head of Housekeeping so they can use this as a coaching moment to improve our room attendants' performance.  Again I am very sorry that the room conditions as well as our customer service both fell short of your expectations.  As for the pet cleaning fee, I am sorry that our policy does not agree with you.

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback you wish to provide in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and your response.

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience.

Mr. Skwierawski, I do apologize that our accommodations were not on a level that exceeded your expectations.  As you said you know, we do offer handicap accessible rooms in our hotel that have lower beds, hand rails in the showers, higher toilets, among  other accommodations for those who require them.  I invite you next time to reserve one to accommodate for your specific needs.  I am sorry to hear that your wife was unable to also enjoy the comfort of our beds and that she felt unsafe in the shower, both of which must have made a negative impact on your stay.  

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback you wish to provide in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly.

As a lawyer for 54 yrs and a judge for 25, I suggest you talk to your attorneys about the safety of your showers in all your rooms without handrails or grab bars.  All it would take is one serious fall and injury to cost far more than the expense of installing a basic hand rail or grab bar in every bathtub in your facility.  Avoiding injuries to guests should be one of your highest priorities.  I suggest the installation of safety bars has become the standard of care in the hotel / motel industry.

As you should know, handicap toilets are several inches higher than a standard toilet, so the toilet you have in most of your rooms is probably 4-6"" too low.

2021-11-09 10:05:51] Email received from: Hannah Seruya <hannahseruya95@gmail.com>: Hello there,
 yes absolutely thank you for getting back to me. I have been with Hyatt since 2018. I actually lived in a Hyatt for four months and had only good experiences.
 However when I came to Green Bay I did not feel similarly. The customer service was OK however my boyfriend‘s medication that was supposed to be delivered and received by the Hyatt front desk was never received they failed to contact us appropriately and sign off on the package as per requested.. Aside for the fact that we have been disturbed numerous times by loud guest banging and screaming.  We were also told that we can have a late check out, and then were to be disrupted by a housekeeper before then. It was uncomfortable for me due to the fact that we were just getting out of the shower and we’re not completely dressed.  I did feel that my concerns were brought to the attention of the staff and were dismissed. There was a really nice gentleman by the name of Scott who helped us out with the parking so that we did not have to pay when there was no room in the parking lot which was another inconvenience on behalf of the hotel . I have in the past had only good things to say about Hyatt however I am completely disappointed with my vacation that I took this last weekend and really annoyed that I had to use my world of Hyatt points towards a stay that was not satisfactory in the least . My boyfriend still has not received his package of his medication that is crucial for his health which by the way cost $400. We were also told that Hyatt would contact us regarding the package when they received it. We did see the package did arrive at the Hyatt Green Bay yet nobody has contacted us.  I did feel a lot of the staff interacted with us in a completely unprofessional way. They told us they did not know which room we were in and therefore cannot come find us to inform of the package is arrival. And then in the same sentence said to try to contact the person on file which is my self yet somehow cannot locate our room number 
Thank you for listening
I can be reached at 347-988-2656
Thank you ,

It was a pleasure speaking with you this morning, as brief as it was.  I want to take a moment to offer my sincerest apologies for your less than positive experience with us.  We appear to have fallen short of even our own standards in many ways with you.  First I'd like to address the matter of Evan's medication and the next steps regarding that.  Now that I have the shipping address, we are going to have that sent out today and will be shipping it overnight to the address provided.  As soon as the shipment is scheduled, you will be receiving an e-mail from with the tracking number.  I am very sorry for any distress this has caused you both as I understand how crucial certain medications can be for one's wellbeing.  Please accept my apologies for the whole fiasco that took place.  Nothing should have happened the way it did.  

In regards to our housekeeping staff barging in the room when I remember personally that your reservation had a late check-out established on it, well it's purely unacceptable.  Our Executive Housekeeper is already aware of what happened and should have already addressed it with her department.  As for your noise issues, I'm sorry to know that your peace was disrupted so rudely and that we did not effectively address this with the culprits who were the source of the issue.  Our security staff is normally far more aggressive in handling complaints of that fashion and I'm so sorry they did not perform with their usual vigor.  I'm glad to know that Scott at least provided a more favorable experience to accent your stay with.  He is actually our new Front Office Manager and is turning out to be a fantastic addition to our team.  We're lucky to have him.

I hope you will accept my most sincere apology for the multiple aspects in which we fell short of your expectations for the Hyatt name.  I have already awarded 8,000 points back to your World of Hyatt account this morning and the hotel will cover the charges to ship Evan's medication to you overnight as well.  Once again I would like to thank you for your time and for your feedback and hope we will get the opportunity to provide you with a better experience some day down the road.

If you have any further feedback you wish to provide regarding your experience or if you have any questions for me whatsoever, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly.  Again, thank you.

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Mr. Staats, I do apologize for the miscommunication that occurred from our reservations team, as the rate you booked at was highly discounted but does not have breakfast included because of that discount.  I do see, based on your feedback, that our accommodations had fallen short on several fronts.  If you would be so kind as to explain these in greater detail a couple of things for me, I'd appreciate it.  What about the condition of our hotel was a disappointment for you?  Were there any maintenance issues in your room or with the overall facility that you encountered?  I also see that you also provided a zero out of ten rating for both the breakfast and food and beverage experiences.  How did our culinary team fall short of your expectations?  Without these details, we won't be able to effectively apply your feedback, so I do appreciate you taking the time out of your day to elaborate.  Again, I'm sorry to know that your stay less than exceeded your expectations.

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback you wish to provide in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

2021-11-09 03:19:22] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Good Morning, Mrs. Kaatz,

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to first thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Mrs. Kaatz, I would like to extend my sincerest apologies for the multiple issues you encountered during your stay.  I'm most sorry to know that you did not feel welcomed here at our property, this issue is of most importance to me.  I will be addressing this with the front desk staff directly and reminding them of the expectations of them regarding their overall hospitality.  I am very sorry that you felt the way you did, you should never feel unwelcome here.  Regarding your specific issues, I see you said your room was too warm during your stay but it doesn't appear that you reached out to the front desk to give us the opportunity to remedy the problem.  In the future I invite you to do so and allow us to provide you with a solution.  I'm sorry to also hear that you were unable to utilize the breakfast package you reserved on your final day of your stay, I recommend in the future booking a room without adding the breakfast package and paying the menu price for breakfast if you know that you will be unable to utilize the full package.  Now about the parking charges, I am sorry to know that you were unable to park in our lot for a portion of your stay.  I can also see that you were charged for parking for all 3 nights.  In order to address this matter, can you please tell me what nights you weren't able to utilize our lot?  I need this information to determine compensation for the inconvenience and charges.  

If you have and questions for me or if there is any additional feedback you might have in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience so we can reach a resolution regarding your complaints. Once again thank you for your time and response.

2021-11-09 06:42:28] Email received from: Melissa Kaatz <melissakaatz@yahoo.com>: Andrew,Thank you for the email.  In regards to the room temperature - we did not contact the front desk because we had our dog with.   Any stranger in the room would not have gone over well, so we dealt with the problem.  It's unfortunate that at check out no staff member asked how my stay was.  The woman next to me checking out was asked how her stay was and she also shared that her room was extremely warm.  The front desk person apologized and offered to provide a refund on all her parking for the inconvenience.  She was never asked why she didn't report it to the front desk.  There seems to be a lacking of consistency in your process.  It was quite upsetting to hear that offered to the person right next to me, when the gentleman had just told me that there could be nothing done with our room rates - they were ""locked in"".  Yet he could have offered a different fee reduction.  You can see how that would offend a customer.I'll make note of your recommendation for the breakfast..  We purchased the breakfast option not knowing that we would be ordering off the menu.  Had we not done the booking price for breakfast, we would have spent even more on breakfast, as a family of 5 by ordering off the menu each morning.  I understand now how your establishment works in this regard.For the parking, I was able to find a spot each night because I literally sat in my running vehicle for 30 minutes waiting for someone to leave so I could park.  You need to be upfront with customers.  When I checked in, I should have been told that the lot often fills to capacity due to other events in the facility and I may need to park across the street.  That is a much different approach than coming back at 9 pm to not being able to find a place to park and then being told I have to park across the street!  I work in a business where customer service is what we strive for - you need to be upfront with customers and share the why.  Just being told ""no"" and after the fact, does not leave customers in a good place.  Thank you for listening.  I guess I'm upset over these issues because I thought I was signed up at a higher end establishment and none of my experience felt like that.Melissa Kaatz    On Tuesday, November 9, 2021, 05:19:23 AM CST, Andrew Monroe <hyattguestfeedback@clients.medallia.com> wrote:

I completely understand your reasoning for not wanting our engineering staff in the room with your 4-legged companion, as every dog I've had in the past had social anxiety issues and did not fare well with strangers either.  I do want to take this moment to sincerely apologize for our failure to provide what should have been the most basic level of customer service to you during your stay.  Hyatt has high standards for the quality of service we provide to our valued guests and based on your feedback, we need to make some changes.  You're absolutely right that consistency is key especially in an observable environment, like at the front desk.  As for parking, I will be presenting your suggestion about informing guests on busy nights that availability may be limited later on and explain our alternative options ahead of time.   Thinking of it, I don't understand why don't already do that.  Thank you your insight to customer service and for your suggestions, I hope they help us improve our overall performance and the experience we provide to our guests.

Mrs. Kaatz, because of the subpar customer service you were provided with, the less than comfortable accommodations you experienced, your difficulties with our parking and anything else that may have gone wrong, I would like to award your World of Hyatt account with 8,000 points.  This is equivalent to one night's stay at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay and can be used to stay at any Hyatt property of the same tier for a free night.  I hope this more than makes up for how we dropped the ball in so many ways for you and hope you will give Hyatt the opportunity to exceed your expectations better in the future.  

I would once again like to thank you for your time and the invaluable feedback you have provided us with today.  It will not go unheard.

In the spirit of hospitality,

We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Mr. Sanaxay, I would like to extend my sincerest apologies for your breakfast experience and the billing error made on your account.  I will be addressing accountability and follow-through with the front desk staff and forwarding this information to my Food & Beverage team so this issue is addressed with them as well.  Now Mr. Sanaxay, I investigated your account further and see that you have already reached out to the hotel regarding this matter and were issued a full refund for the breakfast charges that you incurred.  In order to effectively utilize your feedback, if you would please explain in more precise detail what exactly you meant by it being a s***-show, I would appreciate it.  I again would like to apologize for our falling short of your expectations during your stay.  

If there is any additional feedback in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again thank you for your time and response.

2021-11-09 09:20:33] Email received from: Jim Sanaxay <jim.sanaxay@gmail.com>: Hi Andrew,
Thank you very much for your feedback and follow up on this matter.  I
filled out the survey before my wife called and talked to one of your
employees about the breakfast situation and they proceeded to refund
my account.  I was shocked to see the breakfast charge on my bill as the
employee who worked with my wife apologized and said she would credit the
breakfast charge.
The details of the breakfast situation are as follows:
   - My wife arrived at breakfast to not be greeted by anyone.  There were
   two servers working the breakfast room and not one greeted her or
   acknowledged that they would be right with her.  I understand there is a
   shortage of workers when it comes to hostess/servers and I understand that
   there will be wait.  But waiting for 20 minutes to just be acknowledged is
   not good.
   - My wife walked to the front desk and asked who do I have to get in
   touch with to get some breakfast?  The front desk person said the servers.
   So my wife went back and finally waved one of the servers down, she advised
   them that she would like to place a togo order.  The female server provided
   my wife with a slip to order and this is when things turn from bad to
   worse.  After receiving the slip and deciding on what we wanted for
   breakfast the server never returned back to take the order!  So it took
   another 20 mins for my wife to flag someone else down to take our order who
   was the other server.
   - So now after waiting 15 minutes after the food order was placed, the
   original girl server comes back and asks my wife if she's ready to place
   her order.  Now this is 35 mins AFTER she was originally given the order
   slip to place her order.  My wife tells her that she already placed the
   order with the other server.
   - After finally taking our order it took another 45 mins for them to
   make the food and hand us our order.  Again, I understand that kitchen
   staff are severely understaffed right now but from the moment my wife
   arrived to place a togo order to when she was able to walk out with her
   order it took an hour and 25 mins total time.
   - When the order was finally done my wife took the order up to our hotel
   room, only to find out the order was incomplete!  She ordered two sides of
   bacon and that wasn't included.  So she was beyond upset at this moment and
   she didn't want to risk going back down to the breakfast area only having
   to now wait to get this fixed while our kids have not had breakfast yet.
   So she called down to the front desk and spoke with Becky and voiced her
   frustration.  She said it's completely frustrating  to wait so long and
   only to find out that your order is missing pieces.  Becky apologized for
   the situation and said that she will have them remake the missing items and
   that she will credit the breakfast for us.
The hotel experience was world class and my family really enjoyed your
amenities but the whole breakfast situation really left a sour taste.  I
just wanted to let you know so this doesn't happen again to any other
guests.  Please let me know if you have any additional questions or
comments.

I would like to sincerely thank you for such great detail in your response.  It has already been shared with our leadership in the Food & Beverage department and will be utilized to prevent this from ever happening again.  Upon digging a little deeper into your experience with us, I'm also seeing you had issues with your room temperature and the heating/cooling of the room.  As a token of my appreciation for your valuable feedback and as a means of apologizing for falling short of your expectations of us, I will be awarding 5,000 bonus points to your World of Hyatt account.  This can be used towards the room cost or can also be redeemed for $25 towards a dining experience in one of our outlets.  I hope this is a sufficient apology for our disappointing performance during your stay.  

If you have any further questions or feedback regarding your experience with us, I invite you to reach out to me any time.  Thank you again for your time and invaluable feedback.

In the spirit of hospitality,

Looking back, my original submission did not successfully go through, I apologize for that.  I've resubmitted my request for the bonus points and my Director of Operations will be back on Wednesday to approve it.  So the points ought to be in your account by Wednesday afternoon.  Again I am so sorry for the delay on the promised points.

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Mr. Malmstadt, I do apologize for the issues you encountered during your stay.  First of all, I'm sorry that our passive ventilation system in the bathroom was inadequate in clearing the steam from your shower thus making it difficult to shave afterwards.  Speaking of the bathrooms I'm sorry that our standard guest room does not have hand rails in the showers.  If you require extra accommodations, we do have handicap accessible rooms that have hand rails in the showers.  I will definitely pass along your suggestion about adding instructions for our thermostats in the rooms to our Engineering team, as that would make everyone's life a little easier.  Considering the problems with your stay, I'm glad to know that your experience with the front desk staff was a positive one.  I would once again like to both apologize for your inconveniences, but also thank you for your feedback.

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback you wish to provide in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your time and response.

2021-11-09 09:07:01] Email received from: Michael Malmstadt <mmalms@gmail.com>: Dear Mr. Monroe,
I raised several issues about the room I stayed in last week.  I don't feel
the need for a Handicapped Accessible room as yet.  Any facility that
requires the occupant to step into a tub to use the shower should have
hand-rails.  I don't know what a passive ventilation system is.  If it
means the fan goes on when the light switch is on, the fan in my room did
not work or is so silent that it can not be heard.  The only other meaning
for passive ventilation would be to leave the bathroom door open when
showering.  Once one occupant uses the shower the tub floor is wet and
every other surface in the bathroom is damp from steam from the shower.  If
there is a second occupant, the prospect of stepping into a bathtub with a
wet floor should make you understand the need for a grab bar in the shower
area.  I didn't fall, neither did my wife, but if someone does and is
injured the lack of grab bars in the shower is going to be a problem for
the lawyer hired to defend any lawsuit that results.

I will pass along your opinions and concerns regarding the availability of hand rails in the shower to my superiors as well as my engineering team, thank you for that feedback.  Also, in case you're wondering, a passive ventilation system refers to one that does not rely on any forced air movements (such as by fans), but rather relies on natural air movements both inside and outside of the hotel to initiate the ventilation.  It has nothing to do with leaving your bathroom door open while showering or any moving parts for that matter.   

I would once again like to thank you for taking your time to provide us with valuable feedback on how to improve our operations and performance.  If there is any other feedback you feel compelled to share or suggestions on how we might better exceed the expectations of our guests, feel free to reach out again.  Thank you once more.

Sincerely,

Andrew Monroe

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this evening to first off thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests, such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean, comfortable accommodations, however; based on your response, we have room for improvement. 

Mr. Kinney, I would like to thank you for the positive remarks you made about our front desk agent Ebru.  She really has been a great addition to our team since the beginning of her internship and we are lucky to have her.  It really is refreshing to get to respond to some positive feedback from a guest, so thank you for this.  On the other hand, from your survey I'm able to surmise that you had a less than favorable experience with our food & beverage department. If you can share any more detailed feedback on how we could have met and exceeded your expectations in this aspect, I would greatly appreciate it.  I would also like to take a moment to apologize for any inconvenience you encountered with our gated parking.  I know how frustrating it is on our end when the equipment doesn't function properly, as I'm sure it is for you as well.  Additionally, if you have any preferences for your future stays, I'd like to be informed of those as well so you can be as comfortable as possible during your experience at any Hyatt property.

I would again like to extend my sincere gratitude for your taking your time to provide us with feedback and look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience.  Once again, thank you for your response.

2021-11-07 09:10:27] Email received from: Robert Kinney <reservejudgek@gmail.com>: Hello Mr. Monroe,
What a surprise to hear from you.
The one thing I missed telling you about is that the mattresses needed to
be flipped, at least in room 621. The mattress was very comfortable, but
people tend to sleep on the ""inside edge"" so you feel you are ""downhill.""
As to the food, those who made the arrangements may have opted for the
""economy choices"" during our breaks. The coffee was quite good, but the
selection of sweat rolls was very limited. A lot of places put out a
combination of sweat rolls, including chocolate selections, and then, for
the more healthy-minded guests, something like muffins. The noon lunch I
had was pretty mediocre. Chicken a bit ""rubbery""; there was like a tomato
soup that was nothing to write home about.
All in all, however, for an older hotel the Hyatt is really not showing its
age. The room I had was huge (about as big as my son's coop apt in NYC
where he and his wife resided up until two years ago!). It has been very
well-maintained and everything was very clean. And being a person who is
immunocompromised, I very much appreciated the masking and distancing that
was required. It would not hesitate returning. (For $82/night the court
system -- and the taxpayers -- got a very good deal.

Thank you for again taking time out of your day to provide some feedback.  Especially when it comes to the condition in the rooms, many issues we are unaware of until a guest actually brings it up.  I will be forwarding the information you provided to the different department heads and we will be sure to address each of your concerns.  I'd once again like to take a moment to sincerely apologize that our culinary team's performance fell short of your expectations and I hope with your feedback we will be able to improve that in the future.  

I am, however, glad to know that our efforts in maintaining our property aren't going unnoticed.  We pride ourselves on the accommodations and facilities that we have to offer our guests and I appreciate your recognition of that.  With regards to our Covid-19 policies, as our purpose states: ""We care for people so they can be their best"" and we will continue to do so to keep every guest safe while they're with us.  Our safety measures will be in place as long as there is a need for them.

As I stated in my last e-mail, if you have any specific preferences in respect to future stays (for example the room assignment:  bed type, high or low floor, anything really) let me know and I'll attach that to your World of Hyatt account so any time you stay at any Hyatt, we will be ready for you.

Again, Mr. Kinney, thank you for taking your time to provide such detailed feedback.  We appreciate it.

In the spirit of hospitality,

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to first thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. 

Mr. Lane, I would like to extend my sincerest apologies for the degree of discomfort you endured from your room being so hot.  You have my deepest sympathies for the stress this must have caused you both.  I can understand how much something like this can negatively impact your experience while visiting us at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.  For the inconvenience, I have awarded your World of Hyatt membership account 3,000 points.  We do so value our Explorists in World of Hyatt, so would you please let me know that this resolution is more than satisfactory for you.

If there is any additional feedback in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again thank you for your response.


Sincerely,

Andrew Monroe

Ms. Lanzhammer, I do apologize for the uncomfortable temperature levels in your room, that must have been less than enjoyable for you. I would like to extend my sincerest apologies and sympathies though, as I can understand how an overly warm room can make a night's sleep miserable. I also would like to apologize that the cleanliness of our rooms as they, too, were unable to exceed or even meet your expectations. Upon further investigating your reservation though, I see that you didn't contact the Front Desk regarding your complaints until after you had already checked out and were leaving the property. I invite you next time to reach out to our Front Desk staff as soon as you encounter any degree of inconvenience or discomfort during your stay as they are capable of solving many, if not all problems our guests may encounter and would have resolved your issue by any means possible. I hope in the future that you will give us an opportunity to correct the problem for you during your stay rather than being unnecessarily uncomfortable while you're with us. 

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback you wish to provide in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I am particularly interested in how we fell short of your expectations with your overall Food & Beverage/Breakfast experience as well as your experience with World of Hyatt.  I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again, thank you for your response.


Sincerely,

Andrew Monroe

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe, and I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing both authentic service and clean comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement.  

Mrs. Lanzhammer, I do apologize for the uncomfortable temperature levels in your room, unfortunately our HVAC system has two primary settings, heating or cooling and given current outdoor temperatures our system is in heating mode.  I would like to extend my sincerest apologies and sympathies though, as I can understand how a overly warm room can make a night's sleep miserable.  Upon further investigating your reservation, I see that you didn't contact the Front Desk regarding your complaint.  I invite you next time to reach out to our Front Desk staff if you encounter any degree of inconvenience or discomfort during your stay as they are capable of solving many, if not all problems our guests may encounter and would have resolved your issue by any means possible.  Regarding your comment about the bathroom fans not working, our bathrooms have a passive ventilation system.  This means we don't have individual fans in each guest room.   I hope in the future that you will give us an opportunity to correct the problem for you during your stay rather than being unnecessarily uncomfortable while you're with us.

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback you wish to provide in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in the future please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again thank you for your response.

I did contact the front desk. They offered me a free breakfast. Nothing more..
They also said they could do nothing else for me. What would a free breakfast do? As you said your HVAC only has two settings.  Not to mention, I felt the food was unpalatable.
I’m shocked your HVAC only has two settings yet there is a thermometer in the room.

First I want to extend my apologies as the front desk didn't appropriately document your problems with the room, I will be addressing the failed communication on their part with them immediately.   I'm sorry to hear that their resolution was not satisfactory in meeting your expectations from us.  We want you to leave with the knowledge that if anything does go wrong, we here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay do what it takes to make it right.

I know how frustrating it is when you bring a complaint to someone's attention and are left feeling dissatisfied.  As a gesture of my sincerest apology to you, seeing as you're a member of World of Hyatt, I would like to award your account a total of 8,000 bonus points which is equivalent to one night's stay here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay.  These points are valid at many Hyatt properties world-wide that are the same tier level as ours and will be valid as long as your World of Hyatt membership is active.  

If you have any more feedback regarding your stay or are not satisfied with this resolution, please reach out to me at your soonest convenience.

Mr. Fagan, I see that our customer service, specifically related to your experience as a World of Hyatt member, along with the condition of the hotel appear to have not exceeded your expectations.  I would like to ask a couple questions regarding your stay.  What in particular did our staff do (or didn't do) that led you to providing the rating you did on the survey?  How were they not up to your expectations?  Also, you noted the condition of the property was less also below your standards, was there anything in particular that you came across during your stay that needs our attention?

If you have any questions for me or if there is any additional feedback you wish to provide in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in the future please feel free to reach out to me directly.

I am reaching out to you this evening to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is the feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assists us in improving our overall customer service. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing authentic service and clean comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have some room for improvement. Ms. Bubolz, I do apologize for the in-room HVAC temperature control settings and the issues you had with our bathroom.  I can understand how these could have negatively impacted your stay.  Unfortunately the system we have in place for in-room temperature control allows for either property-wide heating or cooling, so this time of year we can make sure the rooms are nice and warm as winter creeps closer.  I do hope you reached out to the Front Desk so they could have provided some options for how to cool the room.  In respect to the issues with the bathroom, I appreciate your letting us know about the sink, as without your feedback, we'd have likely never noticed a slow drain, so thank you.  I am glad to know that you did, however, enjoy our accommodations as far as the bedding and pillows were concerned. If there is any additional feedback in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in the future please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again thank you for your response.

Sincerely,

Andrew Monroe

Dear Mr. Mcnally,

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe and I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this afternoon to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assist us in improving our overall customer service and guest experience. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing authentic service and --clean comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we appear have room for improvement. Mr. Mcnally, I do apologize for the the fact that our in-room HVAC system did not keep your room at a comfortable temperature during your stay, I can understand how upsetting that must have been.  Also, I would like to apologize for our restaurant's limited hours as we are still working on acquiring staffing to remain open 7 days a week.  I know dining options are quite limited on certain nights of the week.  If there is any additional feedback in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in the future please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again thank you for your response.

Sincerely,

Andrew Monroe

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Andrew Monroe and I am one of the Rooms Supervisors here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this evening to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assist us in improving our overall customer service. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing authentic service and clean comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. Mr. Liccione, I do wish to apologize for the corporate mandated Covid-19 measures that are in place, they are out of our control here at the property.  Also with our staff we do our best to cultivate talent from the given applicant pool, I'm sorry to know that you found our staff robotic-like.  I will personally address this with the front desk, as personality at the desk is part of the experience here at the hotel. If there is any additional feedback in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in the future please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again thank you for your response.

Thank you for taking time to follow up. I did receive great service and the
bathtub was fixed quickly. I did go to the front desk, unfortunately it was
just a really long line due to people checking in. Other than that we
really enjoyed our stay at your hotel.
Thank you

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey. 

I am glad to hear you had a great stay! I wanted to inquire about the food & beverage score which you scored as a six. If you are willing to share more details into opportunities we have to improve in any areas, I would appreciate the opportunity to learn from you. It is disappointing to see a low score without more information on what we can do to fix the problems. 


I look forward to hearing from you. Please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

It looks like you had a great stay! I wanted to inquire about the food & beverage score which you scored as a five. If you are willing to share more details into opportunities we have to improve in any areas, I would appreciate the opportunity to learn from you. It is disappointing to see a low score without more information on what we can do to fix the problems.


I look forward to hearing from you. Please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey. 

I sincerely apologize that your experience did not meet your expectations.  It is unacceptable for a colleague to be unprofessional to our guests, and I will use this as a coaching opportunity for our colleagues. I apologize again that your experience was subpar, and I hope you visit us again so we can provide you with a better experience. I hope your hockey team did well in their tournament!

Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Mr. Schwamb, I do apologize for the pool hours being different than the website. Due to covid and the ever changing pandemic we have had to adjust the hours to allow for deep cleaning and sanitation of the pool area. Also, I'm very shocked to hear that you needed space heaters to be warm enough in your room. I'm very sorry you weren't comfortable with the temperature. Unfortunately we haven't been able to fully open our restaurant yet due to staffing issues but we try to have it open during the more convenient hours when possible. If there is any additional feedback in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in the future please feel free to reach out to me directly. Once again thank you for your response.

2021-10-15 22:14:19] Email received from: Ed Korleski <EKorleski@GLOBALTRADEANDCOMMERCE.COM>: Ms. Schroeder...Thank you...the reason seasoned travelers want contact with local staff and NOT Central Res is because we want to protect our needs. I was intercepted by your floor manager on Sunday...we discussed how your contact person dropped the ball...During and prior to the pandemic, my work with Hyatt was switched to high end Marriott's because of service failures. I try my best to support  hospitality players and I expect support...My pre wedding dinner 20 years ago was held at the H Beach facility with many stays there...After we switched from GBay, The Oak Brook Hyatt took good care of us. I do not care about a broken Coffee maker! Your gentleman server at Sunday breakfast will verify I gave him cash for your hard working floor people. 
I am the co founder of the former Westwind Safari's & Tours...I look for a reciprocal relationship with our hotels of choice.
Best Regards
Edw Korleski

Thank you again for your feedback. Again, I understand the service was the issue. It is something we are really focusing on. Of course there is a staffing shortage and all of our new staff is still training. But I promise you we will do better. We value our relationship with guests like yourself as well. Thank you for your loyalty to the Hyatt brand. We hope to see you again soon!

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize that your experience did not meet your expectations.  Due to the pandemic and business levels, we haven't been able to open our restaurant full time, and I understand the disappointment. Hopefully during your next stay, we will be able to be open!   I would like to apologize as well for your breakfast experience. Would you mind elaborating on why you scored us a three on your breakfast experience? We use feedback such as this as an opportunity to grow and improve. 

I look forward to hearing from you. Please do not hesitate to reach out.

I’m so sorry that you felt my apology was generic. To be honest, I didn’t address your concerns in the email because you seemed unhappy about everything. I sincerely do apologize that you didn’t have a great stay, that your room smelled, you didn’t like the parking and you won’t stay here again. However, I hope you will reconsider and give Hyatt another chance to show you how great we can be. Thank you again for your time.

Dear Ms. Kozik,


Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize that your experience did not meet your expectations.  We tried something different with the boxed breakfasts, as an effort to keep the buffet a bit safer for our guests. I apologize that the quality was lacking.  Having the beverages near the meeting rooms was to be for convenience, but I completely understand it being frustrating that they were empty and far away. I have taken notes from your experience and will apply them to future functions. I apologize that we did not meet your expectations. 

I look forward to hearing from you. Please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize that your experience did not meet your expectations. I would like an opportunity to learn more about your stay and why our food & beverage score is a 6. If you are willing to share more details into opportunities we have to improve our service, I would appreciate the opportunity to learn from you. It is disappointing to see a low score without more information on what we can do to fix the problems.


I look forward to hearing from you. Please do not hesitate to reach out.

very kind, patient, and professional.  My wife encountered him Sunday
during the Packers game (she stayed at the hotel while my son and I were at
the game).  He was helpful to her in remaking a room key.  I have a staff
of 30 people and he is the kind of person I look for.  You need to express
appreciation to him and find more people like him.
Thank you,
Brandon

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize that your experience did not meet your expectations. I would like an opportunity to learn more about your stay and why our Food & Beverage score is a 3. If you are willing to share more details into opportunities we have to improve, I would appreciate the opportunity to learn from you. It is disappointing to see a low score without more information on what we can do to fix the problems. 

I look forward to hearing from you. Please do not hesitate to reach out.

2021-10-09 06:54:43] Email received from: Giovanna Cardellicchio <giovanna49ers@hotmail.com>: Hi, Rebecca.  Let me give you an example.  When we arrived on Friday the parking lot was open.  The next day when we were going out the gates were closed and my room key did not open them.  I went back to the Front Desk and the lady said she needed to program the key so it could open the gate.  Why nobody told me that the first day?  She did not apologize for the mistake.  The young man that checked us in on Friday did not tell me about no housekeeping availability.  We went out all day and came back to a dirty room.  When I asked him he said ""it's on the sheet I gave you"".  None of your staff smiled at any time.  They never said ""welcome"" or ""thanks for staying with us"".   They were not friendly at all.
Hope this helps you to improve your service.
Regards,
Giovanna

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Rebecca Schroeder and I am one of the Assistant Directors of Operations here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this afternoon to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assist us in improving our overall customer service. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing authentic service and clean comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. Ms. Burkhalter, I do apologize for the way in which our front desk host treated you, and that you weren't allotted a later checkout.  We try our best to accommodate late check outs and it should have been handled in a more graceful, hospitable way if we were not able to accommodate . If there is any additional feedback in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in the future please feel free to reach out to me directly. Once again thank you for your response.

Sincerely,

Rebecca Schroeder

The individual who was managing the front desk was outright rude to me and offered no explanation nor options to meet my needs while on site. When I attempted to explain what it was that I needed and that I would need at least until 11:30 to gather my things (it was 10:55 at the time) he treated me as though I was a problem and told me that ""that was the latest he would allow"". As though someone would come to the room to physically remove me if I wasn't out by then.

If you really cared you would demand vaccination proof to enter your property. That way you would protect your guests and employees.

The last I heard from my office was that someone was working on it but they have not heard anything since earlier this week. We just need to get the sales sax removed and an updated receipt so that I can submit my expenses to my company for reimbursement as the charges were put on my personal card and not the card that my office used to make the reservation.
I will wait until next week and contact them again and see what is happening.

2021-09-15 15:33:33] Email received from: Bill White <wwhite015@hotmail.com>: Thank you for your response.  We were unhappy with the parking fee considering the amount we paid for the room.  There were no tissues in our room and needed to request that.  We had stayed at a Holiday Inn in Appleton a few weeks back and would stay there again over your hotel.  Our biggest complaint was the parking fee.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.
Bill and Donette White

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey. 

I sincerely apologize that your experience did not meet your expectations.  It is unacceptable that your girls where harassed for wearing masks, and I apologize that you had to experience that. I will relay the pancake issue with our chefs to ensure it doesn't happen again.  I wish we could have met your expectations on your stay. We will continue to improve our hotel and service and hope you stay with us again in the future.

Good Morning Ms. Vanausdoll, 

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Rebecca Schroeder and I am one of the Assistant Directors of Operations here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assist us in improving our overall customer service. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing authentic service and clean comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. Ms. Vanausdoll, I do apologize for the confusion on your billing. I will be more than happy to explain it to you, and I apologize that you weren't properly told at check in. When you check in we authorize the card for the stay plus $50.00 an night for incidentals, when you check out is when we actually charge your card and the incidentals are released back to you if you did not charge anything back to your room. So because you had a 3 night stay, the incidental hold would have been $150. I hope this clears up the confusion. Please feel free to contact me directly for any further questions or if there is any additional feedback in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in the future please. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again thank you for your response.

Sincerely,

Rebecca Schroeder

The bathroom exhaust fan didn't work, some of the outlets didn't work, and there were not enough plugs for the lamps if you needed to plug anything in at all besides in the bathroom, which one of the outlets didn't work in there. Besides those tiny issues, the major issue was that they charged me the cost of the weekend, plus $100 over for the three night stay on the day we arrived, then charged us upon check out. I didn't know this until the day we returned home from our 8 hour drive and into the next day when I checked the bank. It has double charges pending plus and extra $100 for a deposit I assume? Not happy about that. Our money is tied up and pending, which means I have to wait now after calling the Hyatt to let them know. Not sure how long it will take for the first charges to drop off (which had the extra $100), but when I called, a front desk rep said that it is a deposit and will drop off and only be charged the difference. What difference? I was billed for the three night stay and charged with an actual bill that was sent to my email the day we checked out from the hotel. Why would I be charged twice? And why would I have to wait for it to be cleared and put back into my bank when I was already charged? Not sure if I didn't understand something, but I have NEVER paid double for a hotel and it took four days pending in my account only to be told it will be given back? I am still waiting. Hope it is true, otherwise, I will be one really unhappy customer. With all that being said, the hotel is beautiful and the beds were very comfortable, the rooms are spacious and the amenities like the coffee shop and breakfast and the pool and hot tub, steam room, etc. were all fantastic. The location is also wonderful. You can walk to the boardwalk on the river with many shops and restaurants. Overall we will stay again if the double charge gets taken care of asap. And we now know to make sure we ask for all of the extras to accommodate our family when we arrive.",N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,""""",,,,,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I told her no, I wanted AC.  Finally sent engineering up to my room - he was an extremely nice person who sincerely was trying to help me. It sounded to me as if the motor in the AC unit was not working and he was going to need to call his boss to find out what to do.  By this time, it was almost 10pm and my AC still did not work.

Thankfully that room had working AC.  And it was in much better condition than my first room - which clearly needed some maintenance in the bathroom and the sliding glass door.  I guess the takeaway from all this is that the front desk staff did not demonstrate good customer service that evening, which was incredibly frustrating to me.

Thank you for being our guest and providing feedback. It is feedback like yours that allows us to adapt and grow to make our guests experience better. We do have several new colleagues around the hotel and their training continues. You are correct in that you definitely should have been shown empathy. I apologize for the lack of care you felt and experienced. Please let me assure you that is not service up to our expectations and we will do coaching and mentoring to get our entire team up to those standards. Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

They said it was ready but again it was after 8pm at this point. We asked to speak to manager and the manager never came out and the desk person stated that the manager could only give us a free breakfast. No discount off considering we paid in full for a half a hotel stay. Never staying there again or recommending to anyone. Horrible experience.,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,""""",,,,,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thank you for being our guest and sharing your feedback with us.  Our guests safety and security are our number one priority. I am so sorry that you had that experience in our elevator. I can assure you that we did put it out of service until the tech could come and service the elevator. I am going to issue you 3,000 World of Hyatt points for the inconvenience.   Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey. 

I sincerely apologize that your food and beverage experience did not meet your expectations. I would like an opportunity to learn more about your experience in our food and beverage outlets and why our score is a six. If you are willing to share more details into opportunities we have to improve, I would appreciate the opportunity to learn from you. It is disappointing to see a low score without more information on what we can do to fix the problems. 


I look forward to hearing from you. Please do not hesitate to reach out. 

Sincerely,

We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing authentic service and clean comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. Mr. Winters, I do apologize for the parking issue you encountered during your most recent stay and for finding previous guest items in your guest room. It is unacceptable to find previous items in your guest room but for them to be something so intimate, I do apologize again. If you could tell me exactly where you saw this leak, I would like to get my engineering team on it so we can resolve it before it becomes a bigger problem. Thank you for bringing that to our attention though. For both of the the inconveniences, I have awarded your World of Hyatt membership account 11,000 points. This is good for a free night to another Hyatt equivalent to ours, 8000 points, as well as an additional 3000 points since you have to pay for parking twice. I do hope that this was an insolated disappointing stay and hope you decide to stay with us in the future. If there is any additional feedback in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in the future please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again thank you for your response.

This is an incredibly generous accommodation and on behalf of my family, thank you.  I am a loyal Hyatt client and happy that feedback is taken seriously.  It is my understand the leaks are known by your team as there are multiple in the atrium by both elevators.

Ms. Chang, I do apologize for the AC issue you encountered during your most recent stay and for finding stains on your sheets. We should have absolutely offered another room for you to sleep in. Please know I have coached both my housekeeping and my front office teams on this so that we can learn for the future. I also would like to give you a complimentary night in the future. I have awarded your World of Hyatt membership account 8,000 points. This is equivalent to a free night at our hotel or another Hyatt of similar level. I hope you decide to stay at our hotel again in the future. If there is any additional feedback in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in the future please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again thank you for your response.

We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing authentic service and clean comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. Mr. Mannisto, I do apologize for the frustrations you encountered during your most recent stay. I wanted to make sure I touched base on everything mentioned so as to not be generic in my response. Our mask policy was lifted for vaccinated guests for a good amount of time. It was brought back in to effect maybe 3 days prior to your arrival due to the updated CDC recommendation and uprising cases in Wisconsin itself. We are all hoping to go back to a mask-less world but safety is out number 1 priority. I am unsure why the carpet in your guest room was wet so I have informed our engineering team so they can have a better look at this. I am sorry that you were the one who discovered it. I have not received any complaints about the beds as of late but I will alert my housekeeping team. t may be this room specifically and maybe we can swap it out for a new on for our future guests. The elevators are actually the original elevators from when this hotel was built in the late 80s. I think it is such a fun fact that it is the same hydraulic elevators. They are on the slower side and may have to be replaced in the future but I thought maybe if you knew the fun fact, it may be a little cooler. With the windows to see out, it makes it a little easier to handle. All that being said, I do apologize that your stay wasn't what you expected. Please let me know if there is anything that I can do for you and If there is any additional feedback in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in the future, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again thank you for your response.

Mr. Haugan, I do apologize for the long waits for the room being too warm and for the bar being closed during your most recent stay. We do have our engineering team who can take a look at the thermostat in that guest room to make sure it is functioning properly. I unfortunately do not see the AC units being replaced in the near future but I will pass this on as our engineering team should know. During your next stay, we can send a fan up to your guest room. This helps with the temperature in the guest room a bit and may be a good resolution until we are able to replace our systems. Referring to the bar, we are hoping to get it back to being open 7 days a week again. Everyday our hotel gets a little closer to being back to normal. It is a slow process but thank you for being patient with us. If there is any additional feedback in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in the future please feel free to reach out to me directly.

Thank you for your very professional and comprehensive response.  ’No surprise that my wife and I continue to regard Hyatt as being the premiere U.S. hotel chain.  
We only mentioned the two issues you addressed because we know that Hyatt is always striving to be the best - even in their smaller markets like Green Bay.  We treasure the 40 years that we lived in Green Bay.  It is indeed a very special community.

Please note that some hotels are more or less points then our but an equivalent to ours is 8000 per night. I see that we do not have a membership on file. Do you have a World of Hyatt membership you would like to have these issued? If not, we could always create one for you. It is completely free and I would only need the email you would like to use.

                You now have a World of Hyatt membership! You should receive an email with the details on how to earn more points as well as your World of Hyatt account number. Please give it a few days before seeing the points in your account but those will be issued tomorrow when my leader is in.
If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please do not hesitate to let me know.
Thank you,
Alicia Seymour

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Alicia Seymour and I am one of the Assistant Front Office Managers here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assist us in improving our overall customer service. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing authentic service and clean comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. Ms. Krummel, I do apologize for the daily housekeeping being suspended during your most recent stay. Every day out hotel gets closing to being back to our full selves but it is a slow process and we are not quite there yet. Should you decide to stay with us again before we bring back our daily services, I have added a note on your Hyatt profile that you enjoy daily cleanings. This way, we can know prior to your arrival and can attempt to meet your expectations better next time. If there is any additional feedback in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in the future please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again thank you for your response.

Thank you for being our guest and providing feedback. I apologize that the fitness center wasn't open during accommodating hours for your stay. With the ongoing pandemic we adjusted our hours to allow deep cleaning each night.  We will definitely look at opening it back up for longer hours.  If i can be of any further assistance please let me know. Thank you for your time.

I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again thank you for your response.

Thank you for being our guest and for giving your feedback. We value all feedback as it allows us to continue to make improvements to our customers satisfaction.  I'm sorry that the mask policy changed during your stay. It was very sudden as we follow the CDC guidance and Brown county had became a substantial area for Covid-19 cases,  and we had to allow time to notify everyone. It is definitely challenging navigating through a constantly changing pandemic and we appreciate your patience. If I can be of any further assistance please let me know. I hope that you will stay with us again soon.

2021-08-08 21:09:22] Email received from: Tim Kriz <csi-llc@hotmail.com>: Thank You for your reply and information.  I do understand your situation regarding the virus but simply wanted to point out that it might be best to inform your staff of any changes FIRST and then the guests.  Doing this the other way causes confusion and bad feelings.  Honestly, if I would have known about the mask mandate, I would have cancelled and never stayed the one night.  However, all still worked out OK as almost everyone ignored the mandate and I only saw 2 people that day with a mask.
I do enjoy your hotel and would stay there again, depending upon what happens in the future.
Tim

We had breakfast all 3 days during our stay.  On Monday there were bananas and apples.  Both my wife and I had very browsed bananas you couldn't eat.  Eggs each day were very bland.  Cheese and/or salsa go a long way.  Role ups if you are going to stay with the same items most days would be nice.  No more bananas the rest of our stay.  Only an apple or an orange.
Just a thought to make something a little different.
Bob

Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Alicia Seymour and I am one of the Assistant Front Office Managers here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay. I am reaching out to you this morning to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey. It is feedback from our valued guests such as yourself, which assist us in improving our overall customer service. We here at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay take pride in providing authentic service and clean comfortable accommodations, however based on your response we have room for improvement. Ms. Chapnick, I do apologize for the lower water pressure in the shower you encountered during your most recent stay. I am glad we were able to get you in to a room that was more comfortable. We have let our Engineering team know about this room so we can get the water pressure resolved for the next guest. If there is any additional feedback in regards to how we can exceed your expectations in the future please feel free to reach out to me directly. I look forward to hearing back from you at your earliest convenience. Once again thank you for your response.
Sincerely,

Alicia Seymour

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey. 


I sincerely apologize that your experience did not meet your expectations. I would like an opportunity to learn more about your stay and why our food & beverage score is a six. If you are willing to share more details into opportunities we have to improve, I would appreciate the opportunity to learn from you. It is disappointing to see a low score without more information on what we can do to fix the problems. 
 

I look forward to hearing from you. Please do not hesitate to reach out. 


Sincerely,

When a score is a six or lower, we try to find out if there were any issues or anything that we can do to improve. Since the breakfast experience and overall F&B experience scores were sixes, I wanted to reach out and see if there was anything you thought we could do to improve your experience.
If you had a wonderful experience and there isn’t any areas of improvement to note, then I hope you have a wonderful weekend!
In the Spirit of Hospitality,

Good Morning Ms. Macomber, 

Thank you for being our guest. Thank you for your feedback.  I'm saddened to see that your stay did not live up to your expectations.  The $100 pet cleaning fee isn't due to the dogs behavior, we need to deep 
 clean the room after departure due to any allergens that other guests may encounter.  We will be going through a renovation in the next couple of years, to upgrade our hotel. With covid it unfortunately was pushed back.
If I can be of any further assistance please let me know. 
 
Sincerely,

Rebecca Schroeder

Thank you for being our guest. I would like you to ask you to share more details on why or how you thought we seemed afraid of you? I would love to use your feedback to coach and mentor our colleagues, as we have many new colleagues around the hotel. It is never our intentions to make any guest feel uncomfortable, quite the opposite as we try to provide a friendly and hospitable environment for all of our guests so they cant wait to come back. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you for your time.

We have no idea what one woman was trying to say to us while waiting for the elevator,  we did ask her where the stairs were.

While staying the 15 nights in GB there were a number of issues.  I understand times are difficult still however I hope the time spent on my feedback might improve the Hyatt experience.

Some issues in the room and hotel:

The toilet did not flush, I fixed the chain in the tank

The door did not close properly without slamming and or pushing in the latch area

The dryer on both the 4th and 7th floor require two runs in order to dry clothes, which takes more time and $2 more of quarters each time

The dryer on the 7th floor had some type of sticky substance in it that was all over the clothing 

The beer taps in the hotel pub were out for 3 nights

Three coolers were out of commission for a few days so chicken wings, rueben, etc were not available on the menu 

The initial check in took sometime as it did when I was rebooking my next stay at the front desk.  It was evident that the staff was dealing with a very slow computer system.

Shampoos and conditioner needs to be asked for, sometimes at this location and other Hyatt Regancy locations even if an empty bottle is left on the floor of the bathroom it still is not replaced.

The workout room has the area for the refrigerated towels, however most days none are in the fridge 

Again the staff all seem polite and helpful.  The sales manager Tiffany was very nice and let me borrow a phone charger for a few hours, before I was able to get a replacement for mine.

Good Mroning Mr. Nash, 

Thank you for being our guest.  Your feedback is very helpful, and I will definitely use it to coach and mentor my colleagues and get those concerns addressed.  I apologize about your problems in the pub, we were actually getting all new coolers so it did unfortunately affect the tap lines, as those were replaced as well. They are all installed and we should not have that problem again, but I do apologize for the inconvenience.  Thank you for your time and if I can be of any further assistance please let me know.

My wife has polio and uses a wheelchair. She works with the United Nation on implementing international disability policy.

We have never complained nor have we ever been disappointed staying with Hyatt’s. We alway leave a $5 to $10 tip cash under our pillow for house keeping. 
We also leave our room pretty much the same as we checked in, all trash in one trash can, dirty towels hanging to dry, the bed 95% made with a note thanking house cleaning with a nice tip under the note by the pillow. 

We have to share that the Green Bay Hyatt Regency Convention Center Hotel, especially the ADA room #701 has changed this excellent track record.

July 22, 2021, My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Green Bay in a ADA room # 701. A few problems that should be addressed.

The King Bed needs to be replaced ASAP as the left side sinks in the middle. I believe that for many years of people sitting and sleeping on the left side the springs/coils have giving out. FYI, We have a king Hyatt mattress at home.

The microwave is broken, will not heat water. When attempting to use, it smokes, the wires are burning inside and smells like a fire is going to start. I did not unplug as management of house cleaning needs to confirm.

The ADA shower drain needs to be rotor rooter out. The tile shower floor tilts to one side, 1 to 2 gallons of water collects in a puddle and will not drain. The only way to clean up is to use two large towels. This is extreme dangerous for wheelchair users or for anyone with a disabilities. 

The L shape brown couch with a matching otterman. This couch needs to be quarantined or brought to a landfill. There are multiple stains all over this couch. I would guess that it is 20 plus years old. I would request that Hyatt management use a black light to confirm my observation.

We drove all day from MPLS to Green Bay. We check in a little before 4 pm, got to our room about 4pm and construction workers were jack hammering on the side of the building. We were 7 floors above the jack hammering. This was vibrating our room.  I went down and ask the front desk when he thought they would finish he said hopefully 5pm. At 5pm the construction work stopped. 

Oh yea, at or around 4:45pm the fire alarm goes off, I rolled my wife’s wheelchair to the elevator. Where a line of people were waiting with the alarm still ringing. We later learn from a letter from management that  the alarm went off due to construction dust. 

The past 20 years, my wife and I have been staying at many International Hyatt Hotels around the world. We have stayed at the Hyatt in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Hanoi, the Park Hyatt in Saigon, Vietnam, the Jakarta, Indonesia Hyatt, our favorite is the Yogyakarta Hyatt in Indonesia. México City Hyatt, NYC, etc…. etc…. etc….

I sincerely apologize that your experience did not meet your expectations. I would like an opportunity to learn more about your stay and why our food & beverage score is a six. If you are willing to share more details into opportunities we have to improve, I would appreciate the opportunity to learn from you.

to you.  I know that you are just following whatever the guidance is that
you have been given, but I do have to say we expected something different
out of a Hyatt.  We have stayed in Hyatt Hotels literally all over the
world and just were so surprised when there was no housekeeping, no
substitutions on the menu (which you did take care of, thank you) etc.

We are working on getting back to daily housekeeping, and as a elite member you can request it on your WOH app and should have been given to you at check in as an option. I’m sorry this was not done. I am sorry that other staff was not so helpful. Customer service is so important in our industry and I can definitely see that you did not experience our Hyatt standard of customer service and I am truly sorry about that. I do hope you will give us another try! Please reach out to me if I can be of any further assistance.

Good Evening Mr. Catour, 

Thank you for being our guest and for your feedback. I'm so happy to hear you loved the hotel and had a great stay. I'm sorry that your refrigerator didn't seem to work right. Thank you so much for bringing that to our attention, we had our engineering team take a look at it to ensure we dont have this issue again. I hope you will stay again soon!

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey. 

I sincerely apologize that your experience did not meet your expectations. I would like an opportunity to learn more about your stay and why our food & beverage score is a six. If you are willing to share more details into opportunities we have to improve, I would appreciate the opportunity to learn from you. It is disappointing to see a low score without more information on what we can do to fix the problems. 

I look forward to hearing from you. Please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for responding!
As our business levels continue to rise, we will be adding more to our menu to give our guests more choices. We are currently working on a new menu, and hope to roll it out soon.
I will speak to our breakfast culinary team about the seasoning of the potatoes.
Thank you for responding and bringing it to our attention. It is through your feedback we are able to improve and grow.
Thanks again!

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize that your experience did not meet your expectations. I apologize that our restaurant's hours did not meet your standards. We continue to have limited hours in Pub333 and have not fully reopened following the pandemic. It truly is a matter of our hotel occupancy and number of guests in the hotel. As we continue to gain business, our restaurant's hours will change and we will be open everyday. I hope you will give us another chance in the future so we can exceed your expectations.

I look forward to hearing from you. Please do not hesitate to reach out.

2021-07-14 15:11:36] Email received from: C Staniak <cs4pack@hotmail.com>: As far as the breakfast goes, it was adequate. My omelet was meager in terms of ingredients and cheese. The potatoes were ok. It did give me the feeling of being somehow prepared beforehand and reheated but I'm sure that I was just imagining that. Most importantly, the coffee was not good. It was served in a disposable (Styrofoam? Paper?) cup. I was never offered a refill and would have turned it down regardless. That alone was reason for me to go out to a legit restaurant for breakfast.
The parking situation is ridiculous. When I returned to the hotel on both Friday and Saturday evenings, there was not a space too be found. As a registered guest, that irritated me a great deal. And then you have the gall to charge me for parking. Again, ridiculous. It angers me just thinking about it again.
The pool was nice. The room, though uncomfortably warm, was nice and clean. My bed was comfortable. The only contact with staff in the four days I was a guest was at check-in and they were both pleasant. I did appreciate the convenient little market in the lobby. 
Aside from the breakfast and parking, it was a good experience. Will I recommend your hotel to others? Likely yes if for no other reason the location is excellent.
Thanks for your concern,
Christopher

It was an annual meeting with some family & friends. We usually meet up in the bar for a few hours then head out to dinner & back to the bar for another hour or two. We understand about staffing & reopening. No problem here. Most of us are from out of town so your hotel is a nice central location for us. 
Thank you replying back to me. Sometimes I think hotels etc put those surveys out & never do anything about it. Thank you for being on top of things.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey. 

I sincerely apologize that your experience did not meet your expectations. I apologize for our restaurants hours did not meet your standards. We continue to have limited hours in Pub333 and have not fully reopened following the pandemic. It truly is a matter of our hotel occupancy and number of guests in the hotel. As we continue to gain business, our restaurant's hours will change and we will be open for lunch & dinner, rather than dinner only. I hope you will give us another chance in the future so we can exceed your expectations. 

I look forward to hearing from you. Please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey. 

I sincerely apologize that your experience did not meet your expectations. I would like an opportunity to learn more about your stay and why our score is a 6. If you are willing to share more details into opportunities we have to improve our food & beverage score, I would appreciate the opportunity to learn from you. It is disappointing to see a low score without more information on what we can do to fix the problems. 


I look forward to hearing from you. Please do not hesitate to reach out.

If you are willing to share more details into opportunities we have to improve, I would appreciate the opportunity to learn from you.

Thank you for being our guest.  I am saddened to see that you did not have a stay that is up to Hyatt standard.  we do have several new colleagues at the hotel and their training continues.  I will certainly provide some feedback to our Front Office Team.    Shauntel is our Ast. Director of Operations here at the hotel, she was one of the managers on duty during your stay.  Since you have several issues, please allow me to refund your World of Hyatt points to your account for your stay, they will be credited in the next few days.  I hope this small gesture restores your faith in Hyatt.

Thank you for being our guest and responding with feedback.   I am sorry to hear that your phone was not working in your room, I will have it checked out.  In response to the colleague not wearing a mask, we provide our colleagues the same courtesy as our guests and allow vaccinated guests and colleagues an opportunity to wear or not wear a mask by their choice.  All unvaccinated guests and colleagues are required to wear a mask.  In regards to cleanliness, I am glad you did not smell an antiseptic smell as  room should not have any odor at all if it is properly cleaned.   We follow all cleaning standards set By ECOLAB and ISSA and the Hotel is GBAC certified for cleanliness.  I hope this helps to ease your mind in regards to whether your room was cleaned properly.   We have completed many upgrades to the property over the years and look for to a complete renovation in the next 2 years.  

We hope to see you as our guest again in the future.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey. 


I sincerely apologize that your experience did not meet your expectations. I would like an opportunity to learn more about your stay and why our score for food and beverage is zero. If you are willing to share more details about the quality of your steak, I would appreciate the opportunity to learn from you. It is disappointing to see that you received food lacking our Hyatt standard qualities. 

 

I look forward to hearing from you. Please do not hesitate to reach out.

2021-06-29 19:07:20] Email received from: mario sanfilippo <mjs1017@gmail.com>: Copied from my messenger to Hyatt FB 
I’d like to provide some feedback on my recent stay at Hyatt place Green Bay wisconsin.  
The check in process took 45 minutes, due to a system outage..  The rate was not honored on my Hyatt app.  The application was not working.  The third night free promo was not working on the front desk.  The desk person was very apologetic and nice.  He was trying very hard, not his fault.  I got to my room and the key barely worked, I had to scan my key 10 x for the lock to engage.  I arrived in my room, there was a dirty towel in the shower.  No signage on the side of the building as to which doors were locked.  My key didn’t work.  No disclosure on parking rates upon entry.  No validation offered at front desk.  I had to go get coffee at Starbucks, and go to the front desk to pay for it!!??? That was super inconvenient and took too long.  15 minutes for a cup of coffee.  That’s not acceptable.  Overall the stay was terrible.  The front desk people all were stressed out and short in the morning.  Your door for exit in the lobby for disabled assistance is slow or not working... I have a broken arm.  That was inconvenient.  Seems like everyone thinks covid is still going on with the staff levels.  That’s not right.  Seems like it’s an excuse to save money at this point.  Very disappointed.
All my best,
Mario

Dear Mr. Stephans, 

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey. 

I sincerely apologize that your experience did not meet your expectations. I would like an opportunity to learn more about your food & beverage experience and why our score is a 5. If you are willing to share more details into opportunities we have to improve your food & beverage experience, I would appreciate the opportunity to learn from you. It is disappointing to see a low score without more information on what we can do to fix the problems. 


I look forward to hearing from you. Please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for being our guest and responding to the survey.  I am sorry to hear that parking was a concern.  We do have 2 options at the hotel, the front lot for $10 per night or the city garage, that is paid parking from 6am-6pm M-F & free on the weekends.  Might I ask if there was an issue?  I am surprised to hear that you did not enjoy our downtown area and the many restaurant within blocks from the hotel.  On your next visit please contact me directly I would love to suggest some our our local restaurants that I enjoy.  We hope to see you again soon.

First and foremost the safety of our guests is of course our top concern. I apologize that you did not get that feeling. I would also like to apologize that you did not get the ADA accessible room, and I understand the importance and inconvenience this caused. It is definitely a coaching opportunity for our team.  As I'm sure  you can imagine we have a lot of new team members and I will make sure that this is a top priority for our front desk team. I hope the rest of your stay exceeded your expectations and I greatly appreciate your feedback and bringing this to our attention. Thank you for your time. Please feel free to reach out to me for any of your future stays, as I hope you will give us another try.

Good Evening Mrs. Adams, 

Thank  you so much for providing feedback. I apologize that your room was muggy and your fridge not cold enough. We had our engineering team replace the fridge and look into the HVAC system.  We aim to exceed your expectations, and I'm sorry that didn't happen this time. I hope that you will give us another try, and thank you for being a World of Hyatt Member.

I appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughtful feedback in our survey. I am so glad to hear that your breakfast was phenomenal! In regards to restaurant hours, they have been changing so frequently it has been a challenge for us to sometimes keep it straight and I apologize we didn't have more notice of our PUB333 hours. I hope that as we return to normal, that things will improve and we will be able to be open every night for our guests. 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback.

I agree, it is very disappointing when the room type you booked and are expecting to have for your stay is not available. To be honest with you, we're still unsure how our system oversold king bed suites by 7 rooms. As frustrating as it was you, it's equally as frustrating for us because we need to then work with you - our guest - on a solution that best meets your needs. It is an unfortunate mishap and I apologize that you and your family were initially blocked into a room with two queen bed. I am glad, and we are fortunate, that we had a cancellation and were able to move you to a king bed after you had checked in. I am working with my team to ensure this doesn't happen again in the future. Frankly, it's embarrassing.

I hope that aside from that, the rest of your stay was enjoyable. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. I will be glad to assist you.

Thank you for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize that your bathroom was not clean upon checking in to the hotel. That is not the standards we hold our staff to. I assure you, I have spoken with our Executive Housekeeper and we will be revising the training we provide our team so that these things are not missed. When a room is in inspected status for the front desk to use, that means it should be good to go with no cleanliness issues. I was glad to offer a little compensation when you shared your experience with me at the front desk. 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. I will be glad to assist you.

Thank you for choosing to stay with us and for sharing your thoughtful feedback in our survey!

I am thrilled to hear that overall you enjoyed your stay with us. We were so excited to be able to open the hot tub, sauna, and steam room for the first time since March 2020. We are also working to bring back more amenities for our guests. As we welcome back more guests, we are also hiring more Colleagues so that we can provide the amazing service Hyatt is known for. Thank you for your patience as we return to normalcy in travel.  I hope that during your next visit with us, we will have daily housekeeping service offered again.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. I will be glad to assist you.

Thank you for sharing your feedback.

I apologize for the inconveniences you experienced during your stay. I will touch on each of your concerns. I have shared your feedback with our team so that we can improve how we handle situations, have our rooms in working/clean order, and assign room requests. First, our thermostat system can sometimes be a challenge and while the building was in a cooling mode during your stay, it did struggle at times to cool below 67* across the hotel. Second, our Security Team is limited and cannot be everywhere at the same time. If our team came to your room about noise, it was due to a noise complaint from a neighboring room. I sincerely apologize if our team offended you in any way; however, they are required to acknowledge complaints for other guests as well and attempt to maintain quiet hours. We follow the same protocols at many resort and hotel companies in regards to our quiet hours. Lastly, we do our best to honor requests for room placement; however, it is not guaranteed. On busy dates in the hotel, it can be nearly impossible to accommodate. I am sorry that you and your travel companions were down the hall from each other. My team will work to improve our service and be more delicate when responding to noise complaints. We will also consider modifying our quiet hours in the hotel. 

For your inconvenience, I would like to extend to you 5,000 World of Hyatt points. These points can be used at any Hyatt, globally. You will see the points in your World of Hyatt account in 3-5 business days. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize that the toilet in your room seemed shaky! That's definitely nerve-wreaking. I have shared your concern with our Director of Engineering so that when they are inspecting rooms, they have an opportunity to fix anything that are loose. In addition, I have spoke with our Director of Operations about the pool experience. The pool can get very busy from time to time and we will consider having a sign up sheet. We are also considering returning to adult-only hours in the pool area. These plans are still in development as we return to a sense of normalcy after the global pandemic. I am excited to share that because things are moving in the right direction, we will be back on track to do our hotel refurbishment that will include all of our rooms. That is slated to start at the end of this year or the beginning part of next year!

I hope that you and your family stay safe and healthy. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. I will be glad to assist you.

Thank you for sharing your feedback in our survey.

I sincerely apologize for the condition you found your room to be in. It is disappointing to know that our housekeeping team missed the mark. I have spoken with our Executive Housekeepers and Director of Operations about your concerns and we will be working with our team to ensure we are cleaning every corner of our rooms - it's what our guest expect. I have also shared your feedback about your coffee maker and room curtains. We are looking forward to new amenities and room upgrades later this year once we return normal operations and can get back on track for our plans for total room transformations.

As a goodwill gesture for the inconveniences you experienced, I am applying 5000 points to your World of Hyatt account. These points can be used at any Hyatt Hotel globally. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. I will be glad to assist you.

Sincerely,

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our survey.

I sincerely apologize that Pub333 was closed during your stay. Currently, the hours for our food service do change frequently based upon occupancy in the hotel. Fortunately, things are returning to normal after a year that saw a lot of changes. We look forward to returning to daily operations soon. I know that's not the best answer and sounds like a cop-out, but I assure you, we hear you and are working to add more amenities for our guests. In exciting news, one of the amenities we recently added after 15-months of being closed is our hot tub, sauna, and steam room! We are working to get back to normal for you as quickly as we can. 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out and I will assist you!

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your thoughtful feedback in our survey.

I sincerely apologize that your experience with us left something to be desired. It's discouraging to hear that our staff was disengaged from the operation and made you feel like we were more about rules than the overall experience for our guests. As we are still working through recovery from the global pandemic, we are striving to create guest experiences that make you feel welcomed, comfortable, and relaxed. It sounds like we missed the mark. I have spoken with our Directors of Operations and we are working to ensure our staff is engaged and creating one-of-a-kind moments for our guests. Currently, while there are some procedures that we currently follow that seem like an inconvenience; unfortunately, they are in place while we train our new Colleagues and try to balance experience and efficiency. As we return to a sense of normalcy, we look forward to bringing more amenities back for our guest's enjoyment - things like room service and daily food operations! I promise, we are getting there and hope that if you choose to stay with us in the future, it is a more seamless experience.

As a goodwill gesture for your inconvenience, I have placed 5,000 points on your World of Hyatt account. These points take 3-5 business days to process and can be used at any Hyatt globally. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out - I will be glad to assist you.

Thank you for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I am sorry that your room left something to be desired. I assure you, we have heard you. As we come out of the global pandemic that froze so much of the hospitality industry, we are excited to get back to normal - and back on track for our hotel refurbishment. We have already started the project with exterior work and look forward to interior upgrades and refreshes later this year or early 2022! I am sorry that the TV remote didn't work properly and that the lighting was awful. Those are things that are on the list for refurbishment and we look forward to welcoming you back in the future.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out - I will be glad to assist you.

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for taking our survey and for sharing your feedback about your stay.

I sincerely apologize that an error caused the connecting rooms you had requested to not be available and that we accommodated you in a Standard Suite and not an Executive Suite. I know how disappointing that is, especially since you had called to confirm more than a week prior to your arrival. While it doesn't make up for the fact that the room type you wanted wasn't available, I am glad that we were able to offer compensation in your room rate for the inconvenience. Since your stay, we have also retrained our front desk team to ensure that modifications to the system are documented and reported to our IT partners and can be corrected in a timely manner.

We certainly appreciate your loyalty as a Discoverist to the Hyatt family of hotels and hope that you will consider us again in the future. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for sharing your thoughts in our survey.

We hear you loud and clear and are excited for the coming months as we return to normal and are able to start our hotel refurbishment. The first step in that is working on exterior walls. I'm sure you may have seen scaffolding on the south side of the building. The pandemic has made us rethink how we operate and delayed so much in what we hope to do to expand our guest experiences in the hotel. 

I also assure you, you are not alone in wanting to get back to normal. We have recently reopened our hot tub, sauna, and steam room after 14-months of them being closed and we're working tirelessly to bring more staff back so we can add even more amenities in the future! 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. I will be glad to assist you.

I hope you and your family stay safe and healthy.

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for staying with us and for the positive feedback!

It is always great when our guests enjoy their stays and tell us that we are doing a job well done. I have shared your message with our team. I assure you it was greatly appreciated. In addition, however, I would like to learn more about your food & beverage experience during your stay. I would appreciate learning what we can do to improve our guests experience.

I hope you and your family are safe and healthy. We look forward to welcoming you back to Green Bay in the future.

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

As far as food and beverage go I only ate breakfast and got a bottle of
water at the hotel. I like to explore the local scene when I travel for
either work or pleasure. I don't have any complaints about breakfast so I'm
not sure how much more I can offer in that department.
As the Front Office Manager, you should be proud of the professionalism and
helpful spirit of your staff. They reflect very well on you.
Thanks
John

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize that your experience did not meet your expectations. I would like an opportunity to learn more about your stay and why our score is ""very poor."" If you are willing to share more details into opportunities we have to improve in our customer service, housekeeping, and breakfast, I would appreciate the opportunity to learn from you. It is disappointing to see a low score without more information on what we can do to fix the problems.

I look forward to hearing from you. Please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback.

I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences you experienced during your stay. I will be working with my team to ensure that we are explaining our parking system more efficiently. It's as simple as using your room keys to go in and out and then holding on to the white parking ticket until you check out. Also, we do need to validate the parking ticket and post that on the gates and the tickets. Furthermore, because we were sold out on Friday night and had 154 arrivals, our system does charge for early arrivals based on a sliding scale. Because you checked in at 9:20AM, the early check-in fee is $25.00.

However, as a goodwill gesture for your inconveniences, I have waived the early check in fee. You will see a credit to your VISA credit card in the amount of $28.88 (Fee+taxes) in 3-5 business days. 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please to do not hesitate to reach out.

2021-06-09 05:10:01] Email received from: Jessica Judkins <jessicajudkins84@gmail.com>: While I appreciate the credit for our early check in (it was near 1:00, not 9:20), I’d like a credit for our $16 parking fees. I’m sure I would have agreed your system is “simple” if somebody had explained any of this to me upon my check in. We were in town for a wedding and headed there, so didn’t have time to come back into the hotel when prompted to enter payment for parking.

It's as simple as using your room keys to go in and out and then holding on to the white parking ticket until you check out. Also, we do need to validate the parking ticket and post that on the gates and the tickets.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize that your room was not cleaned to exceed our Hyatt standards causing your allergies to go crazy. I know first hand how inconvenient that can be when trying to just live throughout the day. I have spoken with our Executive Housekeeper and we will be working with our staff to ensure they are following the proper protocols for mold and mildew. Also, they will be working to clean air vents and returns. I am excited to share that now that we are returning to some sense or normalcy after the global pandemic, we are back on track to do our rooms refurbishment. You are right, it is overdue and we're excited about the new look coming to our hotel in the early part of 2022.

Green Bay is a city of industry. There are paper mills, salt manufacturers, and other ore producers along the Fox River - Gateway to the Bay of Green Bay. Just down the river, in Appleton, was the first hydro-electric dam in the country! I know that it can be unsightly at times, but it brings a lot of jobs to our local economy. 

As a goodwill gesture, I am applying 8,000 points to your World of Hyatt account. You should see these points in 3-5 business days. This is equivalent to 1-night at our hotel; however, they can be used at any Hyatt globally.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. I will be glad to assist. 

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for staying with us. I appreciate you sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize that you felt that there was no help at the front desk. While we are doing our best to train 12 new hires as quickly as possible, unfortunately, there are still times when we have pockets of less than ideal staffing. We are getting everyone up to speed and hope that the next time you stay is a bit more seamless and better staffed.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for  sharing your thoughts with us about your recent stay.

I sincerely apologize that you felt our customer service left something to be desired and that your room did not meet your expectations. I would appreciate learning more about how we could improve our customer experience. When there are opportunities to grow, we must jump at the chance to learn. In regards to our rooms and furniture, I assure you - we hear you loud and clear. Unfortunately, the global pandemic required us to push back our hotel renovation. We are excited, however, to get back on course and we are looking to start that project in the later part of 2021 or early 2022!

I would genuinely appreciate learning how we can improve our guest's experience and thank you for your consideration sharing more feedback. If there is anything else I can do to assist you, I will be glad to assist you.

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback with me upon check-out. 

I have shared your feedback about the cleanliness and bed set in your room with our Executive Housekeeper. We will be working with our staff to ensure that they are properly making beds and cleaning bathrooms. In addition, I have shared your feedback with our senior leadership regarding the number of dogs in the hotel. It is a Hyatt Regency brand standard to allow guests to travel with their service animals and pets; however, we are able to control where dogs are allowed and will work with our staff to ensure they are not in areas they should not be. 

If there is anything else you would like to share, I would appreciate any additional thoughts you may have. We hope that you will stay with us again in the future. 

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for sharing your feedback in our survey.

I sincerely apologize that your experience left something to be desired. I'm also not sure whom you spoke with on our staff about the hot tub. The hot tub, sauna, and steam room have been closed since March 2020 when the COVID-19 Global Pandemic started. It is listed on our website as well. I also want to apologize that you did not feel that our Customer Service was exceptional. If there is any further details you wish to share about how we can improve, I would appreciate the opportunity to learn what we can do to assist our guests.

We are looking forward to the return to normalcy in travel and hope to bring additional amenities back on-line for our guests in the future. If there is anything else I can do in the meantime for you, please do not hesitate to reach out. I will be glad to assist you.

Sincerely,

Thank you for staying with us. I appreciate you sharing your feedback with me during your stay and in our survey.

I sincerely apologize that the couch was in an awful condition upon check-in. I am glad that we were able to rectify the situation while we are out. Our team does work to keep our furniture in clean, working order for our guests but sometimes we miss things. I assure you, there are plans to replace the furniture in the hotel during our massive rooms refurbishment later this year or in the early part of 2022. We are getting back on track after the global pandemic delayed the start from September 2020. 

Because you are a loyal World of Hyatt Discoverist and on your way to Explorist status, as a goodwill gesture, I have applied 3,000 points to your World of Hyatt account. You should see these reflected in your account in 3-5 business days. It's members, like you, that help make Hyatt Hotels great. I appreciate the feedback so that we can learn, improve, and grow into the future.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

All of us at Hyatt are forever thankful for your service and protecting freedom around the world. In addition to that, we are proud to offer active and former military members discounts at our hotels. Looking at your reservation, however, you booked a special rate that is temporarily being offered that is lower than the military, AAA, AARP, and many corporate discounts - plus, your reservation included complimentary breakfast! We want to assure you, you had the lowest rate possible for your stay. The standard rate for the room you were in was $99.00, the Military Rate was $89.00, and your rate was $84.00 and included breakfast.

We look forward to your future visits with us. The next time you are coming to visit, please reach out ahead of time so that we can ensure you are getting the best rate possible including your Veterans Discount.

Again, we are thankful for your service and look forward to welcoming you back to Green Bay in the future.

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback in our guest survey.

I am glad to see that overall your stay was a positive one. I know how disappointing it is to not have room service; however, as we return to a sense of normalcy in travel, we do look forward to bring that offer back for our guests in the future. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. I will be glad to assist you.

2021-05-29 17:42:35] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Dear Mr. Schiefelbein,

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey. 

I apologize for inconvenience you experienced during your stay - starting with the check-in. We appreciate your concern and we are working to bring new staff to the front desk and the other operations in our hotel. We are working to balance our staff to meet the needs of our guests in all areas of the hotel and appreciate your understanding as we return to a sense of normalcy in travel. In regards to parking, it is a common practice for the Downtown Green Bay Hotels to charge for parking. As a World of Hyatt Member, we reduce that parking fee to only $5.00/night - opposed to paying $13.00/nightly in the City of Green Bay Ramps and $12.00/nightly in our hotel lot for non-guests. Also, I appreciate you sharing your feedback about our guest room. I have spoken with our Engineering Team to ensure that they look into the room and get repaired as necessary. 

As a goodwill gesture, I have applied a $75.00 credit to your account. You should see the refund on your credit card in 3-5 business days. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out - I will be glad to assist you.

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback in our survey.

I sincerely apologize that you felt the room was not clean nor taken care of. It's also disappointing to hear that the air conditioning was not working properly in your room and that it was warm. I have spoken to our Engineering Team and our Executive Housekeeper about your concerns and they will be addressing them immediately. I want to assure you, from a housekeeping standpoint, the rooms are cleaned between each guest and inspected before new guests arrive. 

As a good will gesture, I have applied a $50.00 credit to your account. You should see that refunded in 3-5 business days to your MasterCard. 

I appreciate your feedback as it gives us an actionable opportunity to learn and improve our service. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize that your room had an odor and that we were unable to fix it, if you let us know about it. I am also sorry that our lot was full and that you had to use one of the alternate lots for the hotel. I know that can be a challenge when travelling. I appreciate you sharing some actionable feedback as well. I have shared your message with our Director of Engineering and he and his team will be working on that room to ensure things like carpet, are in proper order.

As a goodwill gesture for your inconveniences, I have credit back one night of your stay. You will see a credit of $160.55 credited back to your American Express card in 3-5 business days.

Again, I apologize for the inconveniences you experienced. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

I sincerely apologize that your room was not ready for an early arrival. Unfortunately, we were sold out the previous evening which created a shortage of rooms available for early arrival. I understand how disappointing that can be, especially when trying to get ready for a wedding. As a goodwill gesture for your inconvenience, I have credited off $50.00 from your account. You will see this returned to your credit card in 3-5 business days.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our survey.

I sincerely apologize that your room was not ready for an early arrival. Unfortunately, we were sold out the previous evening which created a shortage of rooms available for early arrival. I understand how disappointing that can be, especially when trying to get ready for a wedding. As a goodwill gesture for your inconvenience, I have credited off $50.00 from your account. You will see this returned to your credit card in 3-5 business days.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

I sincerely apologize that your room vents were dusty and that the temperature in your room was uncomfortable. I have spoken with our Executive Housekeeper and Head of Engineering regarding your concerns so that they can be improved for future stays. As a goodwill gesture, I have applied a $60.00 credit to your room account. You will see this refunded to your credit card in 3-5 business days. I am glad to hear that you enjoyed our breakfast.

I appreciate you taking the time to let us know where our opportunities are. We are hoping with our future refurbishment plans to enlarge our bathrooms in the guest rooms. Also, as we return to normalcy, we hope to add more guest amenities back into operation - like our hot tub. I also want to thank you for the compliment about our team, I am glad that we are providing a positive experience for our guests.

Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to complete our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize for the steam issues you had with the smoke detector in your room. There is a bathroom vent behind the ceiling light that should help to exhaust some of the steam from the room. I have passed your message to our Engineers so that they can research that. Also, I am sorry that your room was missing a hair dryer. Extra guest amenities like irons, ironing boards, hairdryers, extra pillows and blankets are kept in closet in the room. I hope that we sent an additional hairdryer up to your room if you mentioned it to our staff.

In regards to the parking fee, your reservation was not booked in the room block and therefore was charged the fee - even though you were visiting for a wedding. Typically, we do not waive the fee for guests booked outside of the block; however, I have taken care of the fee and you will see that refunded on your credit card in 3-5 business days.

Thank you for choosing to stay with us and for sharing your feedback.

I want to personally apologize for making you feel embarrassed and for not asking more inclusive and welcoming questions. I was asking if we could provide a wheelchair so that we could provide a comfortable stay - not because I felt you were incapable and I am ashamed that I came across as anything else. After reflecting on your note, I will work harder to be more inclusive for our guests and more discreate in the types of assistance I offer. 

In regards to the type of room you were booked into, we do have two rooms in the hotel that have lower beds. In future visits, so that we can ensure a safe and comfortable experience, please let us know you would like a lower bed and we will do our best to accommodate your request. Most hotels in the United States do have these types of rooms set up as their ADA-accessible rooms. We strive to provide access for all of our guests and want to prevent hardships and hinderances during your hotel stay. The last thing you should have to worry about is getting in and out of bed and we will do our best to be as accommodating as we can be so that you can be your best, authentic self.

As a goodwill gesture, I have applied 5,000 points to your World of Hyatt account. These will be reflected online in 3-5 business days. 

Again, I sincerely apologize if I made you feel uncomfortable. We hope that you and your family come back and see us again in the future. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. I will be glad to assist you.

Thank you for staying with us during the 2021 Wisconsin State Lions Convention! We were thrilled to celebrate the organization's 100th year!

I sincerely apologize that you had dirty sheets in your room. That is not the Hyatt standard and the rooms should be getting clean sheets every time a new guest is checking into the rooms. I have spoken with our Executive Housekeeper and will are ensuring all of our Housekeeping staff have the proper training and are taking care of the beds appropriately. I agree with you, that is ridiculously disgusting and I hope that our staff responded appropriately when you notified us.

As a goodwill gesture for this mishap, I have applied a $50.00 credit to your room account. You will see that reflected on your American Express card in 3-5 business days if you view your account online.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out I will be glad to assist you. 

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for the credit.  I enjoyed the stay very much.  The service was
wonderful with the exception of the one hic-cup.  I have worked in the
hospitality industry for many years.  I understand the short-staffing, and
unfortunately these things happen.
Kind Regards,
Loni Helmanowski

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize for the experience you had at our hotel recently. I have shared your feedback with our Director of Operations and our Engineering Team so that your concerns can be addressed in our upcoming hotel refurbishment plans. We did have to delay our refurbishment due to the global pandemic, but we hope to start that later this year or early 2022. 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss about your experience, I will be glad to assist you.

Thank you for choosing to stay with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize that your Chromecast and television did not work properly and that we did not replace them like we said we would. I have spoken with our Director of Engineering and we are working with our Teams to ensure we have better communication when it comes to guest's needs. In regards to face coverings in the hotel, during your stay, the CDC reduced regulations for people who are vaccinated and maintained recommendations for those who are unvaccinated. As the news was announced, many guests seemed to hear the news before we did and there was a lot of confusion and difficulty on our end policing it. 

However, since then, Hyatt has made an official statement that masks are recommended but no longer required for vaccinated guests. If a guest is not vaccinated, they are still required to wear a mask. This means that we will keep signage in place but not actively asking guests, aside from check-in or at the desk, to wear masks.

I appreciate you following with mask compliance. As we return to normalcy, we hope that we can lessen restrictions even more so that guests can be safe in our hotels.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out - I will be glad to assist you.

Thank you for staying with us during the 2021 Wisconsin State Lions Convention! I appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback.

I sincerely apologize that the phone in your room was not working appropriately. It should be a simple push of the ""TALK"" button and you should get a dial tone. Unfortunately, there are times were previous guests may unplug something and our team misses that. I will have our Housekeeping Team check to ensure the phone is working appropriately in that room. Also, I have spoken with the Front Desk Team and we will be working to order more Contact Us cards so every guest receives one. 

I am glad to hear that overall, it was a positive stay and we will work better to improve the level of service we provide. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out - I will be glad to assist you.

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback in our guest survey.

I appreciate the kind words about our staff and I will make sure that I share your compliments with the hotel. I appreciate you also sharing the concerns about the state of our rooms. We do have plans to refurbish the hotel. The global pandemic has set us back a little bit in our timeline but we do look forward to refurbishing all of our guest rooms and public areas. We do hear you.

We also, currently, have some rooms in the hotel with smaller televisions. In your future stays with us, if you do wish to have a smaller television, please do not hesitate to call the hotel prior to your arrival so that we can block you into one of those rooms.

If there is anything else I can be of service for, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for taking the time to share thoughtful and actionable feedback with us in our survey.

I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences you experienced during your stay. To address your concerns, the day prior to your arrival, our Engineering Team had to turn off the water to the entire hotel to repair a water line. Unfortunately, when the water was turned back on, it did cause some harmless discoloration. While we did our best to run the water in as many rooms as we could, unfortunately some may have been missed. I assure you that your room was cleaned the day before you arrived; however, it was unused the evening after the water was shut off and turned back on.

In regards to my Front Desk Team, I am sorry that we did not ask how your stay was or if there were problems to address. We will add that back to our interactions. That had unfortunately slipped out of our minds as in the past year, our guests have been incredibly blunt when there are issues for us to address - but, I don't want you to think that is an excuse. We should be caring for our guests and ensure they are having a seamless and enjoyable stay.

I am glad to hear that the interactions you had with our Team away from the front desk were positive. We must do better all around and I assure you we will.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out - I will be glad to assist you.

Thank you for sharing your feedback with us. I appreciate you giving us an opportunity to fix our mistakes.

I apologize that you found a hair in your sink. I have spoken with our Executive Housekeeper and we will be working with our team to ensure that that does not happen again. Sometimes, when our team is moving through the rooms, it could fall off of a shirt or cart. We will do better to ensure we have that all clean prior to guest arriving.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. 

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski
Front Office Manager
Hyatt Regency Green Bay

Thank you again for staying with us. 

I sincerely apologize for my lack of response to your concerns. You are absolutely correct, $40.00 is not enough given the situation and having to move rooms. I have gone a step further and have credited back 1-night of stay in addition to the $40.00. You will see a credit going to your credit card of $132.83 in 3-5 business days.

Again, I apologize that the credit was no immediate and lacked care. I assure you, that is unlike my normal behavior and I am embarrassed that was the example your had for our hotel.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. I will be glad to assist you.

Water was pooling in the light fixture. When touched it streamed out on to the floor. Security came up at 4:15 and said the person above probably took a shower with the curtain out. They could not reach them. The dripping continued throughout the night. My wife and I had an important meeting the next day and did not get back to sleep. The steady stream of water continued the next day and crews interrupted two meeting that I and my wife scheduled. They did the toilet was leaking above and replaced the seal twice. The dripping did not  stop. After a half a day of this my wife called again. We were moved to the room next door. A pipe in the ceiling was leaking and nothing could be done at theat time. We were in no shape for the meeting and events we had to attend. Upon checking out the manager offered a $40 adjustment to our bill. It is our belief the Hyatt should have done a lot more for us than this.  We are not happy.

I sincerely apologize for not reaching out in regards to our elevator outage. I was not informed that anyone was trapped on the elevators, only that there was one stuck. It is a gross oversight in our communication procedure and I am working with our staff to ensure that important information - like guests being stuck on an elevator - is communicated with me. I hope that your son is ok and I am glad that our Engineering Team was able to get him out. We have since had the elevator manufacturer on site inspecting all of our elevators so that this cannot happen again.

As a goodwill gesture, I have applied a $100.00 credit to your account. This will go back to your VISA credit card in 3-5 business days. 

I am glad that we were able to take care of your other concerns while you were at our hotel. If there is anything else you wish to discuss or share, please do not hesitate to reach out. I will be glad to assist you.

Thank you for staying with us as part of the 2021 Wisconsin State Lions Convention!

I would like to apologize for the interaction that you had with one of our servers and at breakfast. That is not the kind of experience we want to share with our guests. I have given feedback to our Director of Food & Beverage and will will be retraining our team on best guest service practices and ensure we are handling situations better. I have also spoken with our Executive Chef and he will be working with our staff to ensure we're providing the high quality of food Hyatts are known for. We must do better - we will do better.

I also greatly appreciate the feedback you've shared regarding your interactions with one of our servers. I have shared your feedback with our Director of Food & Beverage and will be working with our team to ensure we are caring for our guest. You should never have to experience what you described when staying with us. I assure you that we will be coaching our team in the best ways to assist guests and also working to ensure we are helping our team when they are experiencing personal concerns that may come during work.

I am glad to see that overall your stay was enjoyable though. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. 

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our survey.

I am sorry to see that your stay did not exceed your expectations. From the scores you shared, it seems that we have a lot of opportunities to work on to improve our service. I sincerely apologize for that. If you would be willing to share more details about what we can do to improve our service for guests staying with us, I would be appreciative to learn more.

We strive to provide comfortable and inviting stays in Green Bay and it is discouraging when we don't provide seamless experiences for our guests. 

I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our survey.

I sincerely apologize for the cleanliness issues you experienced during your stay, but I'm glad that our team was able to take care of the situation while you were here. I have shared your feedback with our Executive Housekeeper to ensure that we repeat our best practices with our team and ensure they have the proper tools and training so this does not happen again. You are absolutely correct, that we are disappointed that the room was not in perfect clean order when you arrived.

I see that our front desk team did provide a credit for being unable to utilize our breakfast package; however, I want to take it a step further and have issued a $75.00 credit to your room account. You should see that refunded to your credit card in 3-5 business days. Again, I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences you experienced during your stay.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. 

Sincerely,

Thank you for being a World of Hyatt Member and for staying with us recently.

I appreciate you taking the opportunity to share your feedback about the working order of your room and I apologize that the table top mirror did not work. I hope that my staff sent a new, working one to your room if you reached out for assistance. We do our best to ensure our rooms are in working order for all of our guests; but, sometimes, we miss testing a switch. 

I hope that your next stay will be more seamless. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I am so glad to hear that overall your stay was enjoyable. I have taken your feedback about the pullout sofa mattress and shared it with our Executive Housekeeper. We are currently in plans for an entire hotel refurbishment. I know that bed replacements are on that list; however, in the meantime, we will ensure that the one from the room you were in is inspect and replaced if necessary.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

She accommodated us when one of our events changed venues and helped me put together a very last minute pizza party event in. 

On top of the booking and lead up process running well, the front desk staff was a amazing each and every time I was up there. The rooms and lobby were clean and inviting and extremely spacious.  We had everything we needed onsite and were a short walk to the river and a wonderful little hangot area with a river viewing restaurant. 

Everything about both of our stays was just perfect.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our survey.

I am glad to see that overall your stay was enjoyable; however, if you would be willing to share more details about your food & beverage experience so that we can improve that service, I would greatly appreciate it. From time to time, we do misstep and it seems like we may have missed the mark during your dining. I look forward to learning what we can do to make that experience better.

If there is anything I can do in the meantime to assist you further, please do not hesitate to reach out. 

Sincerely,

 We appreciate you choosing to stay with us and thank you for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize that your stay was not as seamless and relaxing as we strive for. I have already spoken with our Director of Engineering and they have fixed the sink water temperature from your room. Unfortunately, they were unable to explain to me what had caused the issue. I would like to ask for your help as well. In your survey, it seems as though there are many areas of improvement for our team. If you are willing to share more feedback about how we can improve our customer service and food & beverage experience, I would greatly appreciate your honesty and feedback.

I look forward to hearing from you and hope that you and your family stay safe and healthy.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our survey.

I am so glad that overall your stay was enjoyable and I hope the dance event went swimmingly! I want to assure you that I have already spoken with our Executive Housekeeper and they will be working with our Team to ensure that things are not being missed. We want to make sure that every room is clean and inviting - you should not have to worry about spills and splatters. We have also had out elevator technicians on site working to relieve the strain caused by down elevators. I am happy to report that all of our elevators are in working order. I apologize that you experienced these inconveniences during your stay.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize that the toilet in your room was a bit loose! I know from first hand experience how unsettling that can be. I have spoken with our Engineering Team who has inspected it and fixed what they had to to ensure it's safety. 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. I hope that your future stays with us are more seamless.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our survey.

I appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts on how we can improve the guest experience at our property. We are looking forward to the return to normalcy and being able to restart our hotel refurbishment plans. We were supposed to start in September 2020; however, the global pandemic has forced us to postpone those plans until the early part of 2022. In the meantime, I have shared your concerns with our Director of Engineering so that they they can be fixed. Our Housekeeping Team also has received your message and will work to clean the windows in the rooms as well. 

In regards to your reservation and how it was booked, it is a third party travel site reservation. It was booked through a site called guestreservations.com. Most likely, when you Google Hyatt Regency Green Bay, it was the first link in the results - this is NOT at Hyatt reservation site. It is a site owned by getaroom.com and is a paid advertisement from that company to Google. It requires you to have a pre-paid reservation. In the future, if you want to ensure that you are booking directly with our hotel, please ensure that you are on HYATT.COM and then search for Green Bay. You can also call the hotel or our central reservations team.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. 

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

I'm glad that overall your stay was a positive one and that your cart was returned. I did want to ask if you had any thoughts about your food and beverage experience. I did see that you rated that part of the survey rather low. If there are any details you wish to share, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Also I am referring to the restaurant part that has nothing to do with the bar where as I already shared my thoughts on that. It had more to do with the quality of the poor service. It took forever for the girl to take my breakfast order. It was as if she was hung over from the night before. Once I finally did order it took an extremely long time to get my food. They were not that busy. She did not come back to see if we wanted anything else. I had to seek her out. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of our party left and he waited a long time for someone to finally come to take the money for purchase. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I realize with the pandemic things are not as they were in the past. I am hoping this ends by convention time next year and they go back to the buffet style type breakfast we all enjoyed for years prior to this year. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After my poor experience on Friday I chose to go somewhere else for my breakfast the next two days. This was a big inconvenience. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will say when I finally did get my food, it was good. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I hope this clears up things for you. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also again the gentleman at the check in desk acted very prompt;y in getting my cart&nbsp; back. I had it loaded at home and really did not want to unload it. I went to Harbor Freight and they said there was none with in 100 miles and the warehouse was out as well. I did unload mine and was grateful to get it back when someone at the hotel took it. He mentioned to security he thought it was the hotels but they don't resemble the hotel's at all.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you need anything else at all call be at 920-720-9380 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brian Zenefski  Sent:&nbsp;Friday, April 30, 2021 at 2:59 PM

Thank you for sharing more details about your stay. I appreciate your time providing us with actionable feedback. I will be working with our Food & Beverage Manager to speak with our team and see how we can improve service. It is uncalled for to have extreme wait times and for our staff to seem “hungover.”
Please do not hesitate to reach out if there is anything else you wish to discuss.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize that you felt the breakfast was overpriced. I have shared your feedback with our Food & Beverage Director and she will work with her team to see what modifications can be made to create more value for our guests. I am also disappointed to see that our customer service left something to be desired. If there is anything further you can share that we can learn from and improve, I would appreciate the opportunity to listen/read. 

Please do not hesitate to reach out with more information or if there is anything else you wish to discuss.

Thank you for sharing your feedback and for staying with us.

I sincerely apologize that your room had a stale/foul odor.  We do clean and inspect every room prior to arrivals and I have spoke with our Executive Housekeeper to research how the smell could have been missed. I am glad to hear that aside from that, your stay was enjoyable.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

I sincerely apologize that our breakfast experience was a challenge and that we did not make it more clear for you.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences you experienced during your stay. In regards to your concern about paper towel, we have never placed rolls of paper towel in our guest rooms. If this is something a guest needs, we certainly would have had a roll delivered to the room. It is solely based on request from our guests. As for PUB333 hours, we are working to add more days and hours to our schedule. Unfortunately, it is based on occupancy in the hotel. As we move through the global pandemic and return to some sort of normalcy, we do hope to make PUB333 available daily once again.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for staying with us and for being a loyal World of Hyatt Discoverist.

I sincerely apologize for the condition your room was in and that you felt that it was ""yucky."" I want to assure you, the room is cleaned and sanitized by our Housekeeping Team; then, it is inspected by our Executive Housekeeper. We are aware that we need a refurbishment. Our original plans to start the rooms refurbishment in September of 2020 was sidetracked by the global pandemic. Unfortunately, it has caused us to delay the project until the Fall of this year or Winter of 2022. Like everyone, we hope that the return to normalcy after a very long year will bring new and refreshed rooms for our guests.

As a goodwill gesture, because of the inconveniences you experienced, I will be placing 8000 points on your World of Hyatt account. These points can take 3-5 business days to post to your account and can be used at any Hyatt globally.

Again, I apologize that your stay was not as comfortable as we strive for. If there is anything else we can do to assist you, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for taking the time to complete our guest satisfaction survey. We appreciate your World of Hyatt membership and we value your feedback. 

I am pleased that you had a great stay overall and a pleasant interaction with our staff! However, I sincerely apologize for the noise issues that occurred during your stay. Our quiet hours are from 9PM- 7AM, and these are in place so that we can provide a tranquil and peaceful environment for our guests. We tried to contain the noise from kids on the floors, however I am sorry that we may have missed this during your stay. Please know that our Security team has addressed these concerns so that we can better monitor it in the future. In addition, I have added a note to your World of Hyatt profile for a quiet room, away from noise for future stays. 

Thank you once again for your feedback. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Sincerely,

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback in our guest survey. I think I may have replied to your relative in another email.

We appreciate you staying with us. I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences you experienced during your stay. I have already spoken with our Director of Engineering regarding the water pressure and temperature controls. They will be working to ensure that everything is in working order. We are also hoping the return to normal operation will get us back on track to start our whole-hotel refurbishment. Our goal was to start in October 2020; however, when the global pandemic decimated the hospitality industry, we have had to delay that to later this year into early 2022.

In regards to the mask policy in our hotel, we are following the guidelines from the CDC and the mask mandate in the City of Green Bay. We understand that it is inconvenient to wear masks; however, we appreciate you working with us as we continue to push back to normalcy and end the spread of COVID-19. We strive to create a safe environment for all of our guests and we feel that, at this time, this is the best course of action. We hope that as more people are vaccinated that we will be able to end mask mandates.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our survey.

I sincerely apologize that the first impression you had when you walked in was tarnished. Yes, we did experience about a 2-hour long outage of 3 of our elevators. While it is an incredibly rare event, it can happen in any building. I am sorry that it forced you to utilize our stairs and that brought on other issues for your mobile key. I have already spoken with our IT Manager and we will be testing our system to ensure that this does not happen again in the future. We will also do our best to have our elevators in service for our guests. 

As a goodwill gesture for your inconvenience, I have applied 5,000 points to your World of Hyatt account. These points can be used at any Hyatt, anywhere in the world. You should see these reflected in your account in 3-5 business days. 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. I will be glad to assist you.

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for choosing to stay with us and for sharing your feedback in our survey.

I sincerely apologize that the other guests in the hotel caused some disruptions during your stay. Our Security Team was well aware and did monitor the floors for disruptive guests. Unfortunately, aside from just yelling across the atrium, it was a challenge that we are working on improving. We have already advised future large, contracted groups that include families that our quiet hours are 9:00PM-7:00AM. 

We hope that your future stays will be less stressful and more peaceful. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out - I will be glad to assist you.

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for being a World of Hyatt member and completing our guest satisfaction survey. We appreciate your feedback and response about your stay. 

First, I would like to thank you for addressing these concerns with me during your stay. You gave us an opportunity to fix what we can. I sincerely apologize for the barking dog issue, I understand how frustrating these situations can be along with trying to sleep comfortably. I know it was not ideal but I am glad we were able to accommodate you with a different room. I have updated your World of Hyatt profile so that we do not place your reservation near pets and to be away from noise. Although we cannot always guarantee a quiet night, I hope this will help future stays in our hotel.

I have also addressed the bedding issue with our head of housekeeping to ensure it does not happen again in the future. We are taking extra steps in making sure we can get items delivered in a timely manner. We strive to provide great experiences for all our guests and I apologize if this was not the overall experience you had with the hotel. I am sorry for the lack of timeliness with the food and beverage service. We are working on areas with our food & beverage to see what can be improved. As we do return to our new normal, we hope to see an increase in people who are interested in joining our team so that we can better serve others, especially in these busy mornings.

In addition to the $20 food and beverage credit we added to your room, I have placed another $30 off your final bill. It may take a few business days to reflect your bank.  Thank you again for your feedback! If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. 

Sincerely,

Noely San Juan

Thank you for your feedback regarding your stay.

I sincerely apologize for the experience you had with us. I have shared your feedback with our Executive Housekeeper and Director of Operations and we will be working to ensure that our rooms are fresh, clean, and sanitized upon arrival. I want to assure you that we will be starting an entire refurbishment of the hotel later this year. Sadly, the global pandemic has pushed our schedule back a bit. But, your feedback is actionable and we will do better.

As a goodwill gesture for the inconveniences you experienced, I will be adding 5,000 points to your World of Hyatt account. These points can be used at any Hyatt globally and usually take 3-5 business days to update.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out - I will be glad to assist you. 

Sincerely,

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your thoughtful feedback in our guest survey.

We appreciate your loyalty as a World of Hyatt Explorist. I sincerely apologize that you did not feel that you received a value while staying with us and that our parking lot was full. We did have a very busy weekend with a lot of guests in and out that kept our parking lot revolving. We do have alternate parking lots that we can utilize and we are happy to provide maps and directions to those lots. I apologize if my staff did not come across as helpful as they should when you arrived and I will be discussing your concerns with them. 

In regards to our room rates, the same rates can be found on Hyatt.com that are on third party booking sites. Unless the third party booking site is providing an additional discount above the rates that we provide to them. Also, when you book directly through Hyatt.com, you receive the maximum benefits earnings for World of Hyatt versus not receiving any points with a third party reservation. As an Explorist with World of Hyatt, we want to ensure that you are earning the most points towards your account and welcome you to even book directly through us, here at the hotel, by speaking to the front desk or myself. 

I will be working with our Director of Operations to ensure that we are meeting the needs of our guests, especially our loyal guests, like yourself. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. 

Sincerely,

Thank you so much for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our survey.

I sincerely apologize that you experienced challenges with controlling the temperature in your room. While we have a two-pipe system in the hotel and the entire building can be in either heat or cool modes, with either of those settings you should still have been able to make modifications to be comfortable in the room. I have shared your feedback with our Engineering Team so that they can take a look and ensure it's properly operating. They will also be looking into securing the fridge in the room. There should be some wiggle room; however, not enough that you would have had to hit your fingers.

As a goodwill gesture for your inconvenience, I am applying 4,000 points to your World of Hyatt account. This is equivalent to 50% discount off of the room rate. The points can also be utilized at any Hyatt globally.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback about your experience with us.

I sincerely apologize that you experienced so much noise from your upstairs neighbors and that you had other working order issues in your room. I have spoken to our Director of Engineering and he and his team will be working to repair the televisions in the room as well as check the thermostat to ensure that it is working properly. In regards to noise, there are subfloor and concrete between the floors that should help mitigate some of the noise. From your description, it seems at though someone was being incredibly loud. 

We do our best to monitor guest floors for noise and our Security is quick to respond to noise complaints. In the future we will hopefully be able to stop noise even quicker so that guests have a more enjoyable experience.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us.

I sincerely apologize that there were so many guests not wearing face masks/coverings during your stay. It has been a struggle for us at times and we are doing our best to catch those without masks in our public spaces. We have signs and reminders at every entrance and exit of the hotel, in addition to new signage inside the building and on all of the floors. Sadly, as much as we want to be in all places, all the time to monitor compliance, we cannot and we must leave some of the responsibility to our guests. Unfortunately, not all of our guests are as thoughtful as you and understanding that masks are here to help us reduce the spread of COVID-19 and will help us eventually get back to some sort of normalcy.

I assure you, we will work harder to monitor compliance and asks guests to wear masks. 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

2021-04-12 21:33:23] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Dear Mr. Williams,

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey. 

I sincerely apologize that the room you were in was not cleaned and prepared properly to our standards. From what you shared, I am embarrassed that that was the condition your room was in. We were to start our entire hotel refurbishment in September 2020; however, as I'm sure you are aware, the global COVID-19 pandemic has put a strain on our industry and we have had to postpone the refurbishment. We are hoping to start the renovation project at the end of 2021 or beginning part of 2022. I have also shared your concerns with our Executive Housekeeper. We will be working to retrain our Housekeeping staff in the best practices for Hyatt Hotels and to ensure this does not happen again as best as we can. 

As a goodwill gesture, for your inconvenience and because you are a World of Hyatt Member, I am applying a $50.00 credit your reservation. You will see this credit on your account in 3-7 business days. 

Again, I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. 

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback about your experience.

I sincerely apologize that your room condition was in disrepair. We are working to get back on track for our entire hotel refurbishment now that we are returning to some sort of normalcy with our business. I have also spoken with our Director of Engineering so that his team can fix or touch up what needs repair. 

In regards to the incidental hold, when you arrived to the hotel, we only authorize a credit/debit card for potential incidentals - or - for cash, it is for incidentals and a security deposit. There is not a detailed list of these charges because it is not a charge. It is an authorization/security deposit. It is there in case you charge something back to the room from the Market, Pub333, premium internet, phone calls from the in-room phone, parking fees, etc. The authorization is released to a credit/debit card upon check-out. For cash incidental/deposits, our Housekeeping Team will inspect the room for damages/smoking and if everything is ok with the room, the deposit is returned. 

For the few hotels, like us, that still accept cash at check-in, it is a standard practice. If you use a card at any other Hyatt Hotel worldwide, and nearly every other major hotel chain - including Hilton and Marriott, this is a standard practice. I apologize if it was not made more clear the reasons for this and the details of what is/is not considered an incidental. Also, from what I can see on your hotel statement, you did receive your deposit back. 

I hope that your future stays are more enjoyable and seamless. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

I sincerely apologize that your room keys stopped working prior to your late check-out time and that you experienced longer than normal wait times at the front desk. We are working to bring staff back and hire more so that we do not have lines at the front desk. I appreciate your understanding as we are still in a global pandemic and working to find a stride with the waves of guests that come and go. Also, our Housekeeping Team did follow proper protocols in that they have no way of verifying names and IDs for particular rooms and as a security precaution, are not allowed to let someone into a room. 

I am sorry that these inconveniences caused you to be late for your daughter's dance group. I have spoken to our IT Manager to ensure when we update rooms for late check-out, that the keys also follow suit. As a goodwill gesture, I am putting an automatic late check-out of 2:00PM on your reservation now. This will ensure that the keys work past noon and it will also allow you some extra time in the room should you need it. 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. We look forward to welcoming you back at the end of April. 

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our survey.

I sincerely apologize that you experienced inconveniences during your stay. I have already spoken with our Engineering Team so that they can troubleshoot our water system and ensure that everything is in working order. I have also shared your feedback with our Food & Beverage Team. They appreciate your feedback and will work on optimizing and modifying our menu to accommodate more guests. We want to ensure that our guests feel that they're receiving a value when staying with us - in addition to a comfortable and safe room.

We must work harder to be better for our guests. I appreciate your kind works about Kristin and Brooklyn in The Market as well. I hope that your future stays are more seamless and that you do not experience any inconveniences. 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

2021-04-05 20:52:02] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Dear Mr. Webster,

Thank you for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize for the incorrect postings on your hotel statement and that it was not automatically sent to you upon check-out. The mispostings from breakfast have been refunded to you. In regards to parking, we offer a reduced rate of $10/nightly for hotel guests. This is less than parking in City Parking. As a World of Hyatt Member, you were offered an even more reduced parking rate of $5/nightly. As a goodwill gesture, I have waived that for you due to the inconveniences you experience. You will see the credits in 3-5 business days.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. 

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski
Front Office Manager

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us. 

I am glad to hear that you and your family enjoy staying with us! We also appreciate you being a Member of World of Hyatt. It's a great program where you can earn points for free stays and get discounted parking at our hotel. I sincerely apologize that the thermostat in your room was not working properly. I have spoken with our Director of Engineering in regards to this so that he and his team can fix any problems there are. Thank you for bringing it to our attention!

I'm also glad to hear that you enjoyed the breakfast! We have worked really hard to provide a fresh, hot breakfast for our guests that different from the new ""norm"" that's finding it way through hotels around the globe. We hope to offer more options into the future and appreciate you staying with us in Green Bay!

I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences you experienced during your stay. You noted that from your last trip until the most recent trip that there was a change in the cleanliness and working order. We don't want that to be the new norm and I have addressed your concerns with our Executive Housekeeper and Director of Engineering.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences you experienced during your stay with the bathroom mirror, Chromecast, and parking concerns. I have already spoken with our Executive Housekeeper and she will be working with her team to ensure that little things like fingerprints are not missed. We will also be checking to ensure all of the parts of our Chormecasts are in the room so that future guests can enjoy the connectivity to watch their favorite streaming shows while they travel.

In regards to parking, we charge for parking so that our guests have a secure lot available to them. There are times where we must utilize overflow lots. We offer a reduced rate of $10/night which is less that the City of Green Bay parking lots and other hotels in the area. In addition to this, we offer our World of Hyatt Members discounted parking as a ""thank you"" and sometimes have promotions that will even offer parking to be included. We have played with the idea of including it in the room rate and we hear concerns that our rates are too high. We also have a number of guests that don't drive to our hotel. They may utilize other transportation services and that may not be wise for them. 

As a goodwill gesture, I have refunded the parking charge from your stay. I have also noted your profile that we will do our best to offer discounted parking during your future visits.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss during your stay, please do not hesitate to reach out.

2021-04-05 09:45:51] Email received from: Sami Clark <clarsj09@gmail.com>: Good afternoon Mr. Zagorski,
Thank you very much for refunding me the $10 parking fee but you really
didn't have to do that. I knew about the $10 parking fee, yet still decided
to stay at the Hyatt because I honestly love staying there. Unfortunately,
it fell a little short this time because of the Chromecast and fingerprint
incident but we are only human, so those things happen. However, I really
appreciate the fact that you went out of your way to contact me regarding
my review because it means that your always looking to improve both the
Hyatt and customer relations. Finally, you also don't have to make a note
on my account about decreasing the price of parking on my future stays,
although I do appreciate it.
Thank you again for contacting me even though I'm sure your busy. I really
appreciate your goodwill gestures!

The things I liked are how large the rooms are (separate bedroom and living room/kitchen/bar area), they have Chromecasts on all the TV's, the TV in the bedroom looked a lot bigger than the last time we stayed there, they have a light up magnifying mirror in the bathroom, etc. 

The things I didn't like:
Having to pay $10/night for parking (I personally don't think you should have to pay to park at the hotel your staying at, that charge should be included in the room fee. Also, the charge shouldn't be anymore than $5/night!) This time I struggled with the chromecast because the one in the living room wasn't plugged in and someone stoled a piece of it, which made it useless (the part that plugs into the wall). I had to call a number in order for them to have someone come to my room to get a replacement for the piece missing. Also, the light up magnifying mirror in the bathroom had finger prints on it again (had the same thing the last time I stayed at the Hyatt).",N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,""""",,,,,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback with us in our survey. 

I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences you experienced during your stay and that your room was not cleaned better prior to you checking in. I appreciate that you shared your feedback with me at the time you checked-out as well. I have also already spoken with our Executive Housekeeper and we have already taken steps to retrain our Housekeeping Team to ensure that things like food on the floor are not missed. I have also spoken with our front-line staff about their attitudes and how are are expressing ourselves to our guests. You are absolutely correct, at this time, it is a blessing for all of us in the hospitality industry to be working. Without our guests, we could cease to exits. Thank you for staying with us and supporting the return to normalcy in travel. 

As we do return to our new normal and move out of the COVID-19 global pandemic, we must do better. We are grateful for the return of business and I want to assure you that appropriate conversations have taken place with our staff.

As we discussed when you were departing the hotel, I have already placed a $50.00 credit on the room account prior to posting the final charge. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out - I will be glad to assist. 

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to share your feedback in our survey.

I sincerely apologize for the experience you had with our Pub333 and Market staff. I have shared your feedback with our Food & Beverage Manager and we have taken the appropriate steps with our staff to ensure they are taking care of our guests. We have also started working the schedules around as well so that there are not long waits for food. As we are hopefully near the end of the COVID-19 pandemic and can return to normal operation, we are hoping to bring back more of our staff or hire more so that we can be better prepared for busy weekends.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. 

Sincerely,

To say I am flattered, is an understatement. Thank you for the kind words.

I appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback in our guest survey. Taking the information you shared and using it to learn is the only way that we can see what we're doing right and what needs improvement. I have already shared your feedback with our Director of Engineering and our Food & Beverage Team. Our Engineers will be looking at the refrigerator in your room and our Food & Beverage Team will work to ensure that we're not gauging guests on the pricing of Market items. I do know that as we are coming out of the global pandemic, that we are taking a hard look at our room rates and other amenities to ensure that we are providing a value to our guests. 

Also, with World of Hyatt, you are now on your way to earning points for stays that can be used for purchases in the Market and other areas of the hotel...and those points generally work globally! 

Again, I want to thank you for the kind words and for sharing your feedback with us. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out - I will be glad to assist. We look forward to welcoming you and your family back to Green Bay in the future.

I love the aesthetic, and the bar/restaurant downstairs as well as the friendly staff and convenient location. However im wondering (per my last review in our previous emails in this thread) is there any way to make sure I have an updated, very clean room? I really want to give you guys another chance, but during my last stay the room was not very clean and the shower was not the most updated nor inviting. I mean all of that in the most non offensive way possible. I would be looking for a room for Friday Sept. 24 - Saturday Sept. 25th.

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us. 

I appreciate your honesty and providing us with opportunities to learn where we need to improve. As we are returning to some sort of normalcy during the global pandemic, we are making adjustments to our offerings and schedules of amenities in the hotel. I have shared your feedback with our Director of Operations and hope that we can make adjustments that allow our guests to enjoy the hotel but also allows us to deep clean guest areas to keep them safe. I will also be working with my team to ensure that we are sharing the correct information about our food and beverage operations. I am also addressing the hand sanitizer concern and we will be making sure to have all of the locations filled. 

I'm thrilled to hear the overall our staff was pleasant. I have talked to my staff at the front desk to ensure that we don't run after guests and we should NOT be rude either. Our guests choose to stay with us and we want to ensure that they are having a positive stay.

Thank you for sharing your feedback about your experience.

I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences you experienced during your stay. Unfortunately, due to unexpected changed with some reservations for the large dance group at the hotel, it did require a few arrivals to change room types. I know how frustrating that can be. Looking at your account, I do see that Noely, who assisted you at check-in, did reduce your rate by over $40 for that specific room, offered your complimentary parking, and complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience. It is a very rare and always unfortunate occurrence when we have to ask guests to stay in a room that they did not book. Also, because of the late hour of your arrival, coupled with the sold out weekend, our front hotel surface lot was full. We are fortunate to have multiple other lots near the hotel that our guests can utilize. When this happens, we do not charge for parking. 

In regards to the noise levels of the hotel, hours for the restaurant, and hand sanitizer, I have spoke with our Director of Operations and we are continually working to return to normalcy. Our Security Team is working to have more staff on busy weekends and our Housekeeping Team is waiting for more shipments of hand sanitizer. Sadly, across the country, there are still some shortages. As we are still in the middle of a global pandemic, while the hotel was sold out for an event, it still means that our hours are reduced. We are working to bring back our staff, but while your stay we were completely booked, on Sunday, when everyone left, we were left with 23 of our 241 guest rooms occupied. The roller coaster of occupancy we have experienced is frustrating at times and we are doing our best to get back to normal so that we can offer all of our amenities for more hours in the future. I certainly appreciate your understanding as we are working on recovering from the COVID-19 global pandemic.

I hope that once we are fully operational and back to normal, that you will give us another opportunity to impress you. The global pandemic has put a strain on the hospitality industry and affects cities differently. We will get back to normal and I hope that when that happens, you will be able to experience our Midwest hospitality at it's finest.

In addition to the compensation that Noely offered upon check-in, I will also be placing 8000 points in your World of Hyatt account. This is equivalent to one night in our hotel; however, they can be used at any Hyatt Hotels and Resorts anywhere in the world. These points take anywhere from 5-7 business to post into your account. 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out - I will be glad to assist you.

2021-04-03 23:37:26] Email received from: Ann Pachapa <annpach@yahoo.com>: Hi Mr. Zagorski,
Thank you for reading, considering and responding to my concerns. I wanted to mention how very lovely the young lady at check in was and her manner was very nice. She did not mention the complementary breakfast however, you will notice I did not utilize it. I was one of very few cars parked in that parking garage across the street, walked alone to my room at that late hour with no security; and I believe parking is free on weekends. 
How very lucky your hotel is to get sold out during a pandemic, many other hotels don’t. If you can not handle being sold out while maintaining superior service, don’t sell out. Share the wealth with other hotels and workers who could possibly use it. I am not understanding of why others unexpected  changes became my unexpected changes in room and beds, nor why my schedule should be dictated by your hotel which apparently is first come first serve. Thank you for the reduction in fee for the room, I assure you my comfort was reduced as well. I bring these items to your attention as I was asked in an email, so you will be aware of what is going on in your establishment; all are easily fixable for future guests. I did not list items like the ridiculously slow elevators and weird floor plans. But your response indicates you already know of the understaffed, limited parking and first come first serve regardless of what is booked. 
Finally I want to mention, I’ve stayed in a hotel room 23 nights so far this year, and not one of those nights in the hotels was hand sanitizer not available to guests. For that there is no excuse, go buy some at Walgreens, figure it out. To not have hand sanitizer available during a pandemic gives the impression that you just do not care.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I appreciate your feedback about our luggage carts. We currently have 9 for the hotel which is double of what Hyatt recommends for properties our size. We are working to acquire new carts for our property that allow for us to find empty carts on busy weekends when they may be left on floors or in our parking lots. In regards to parking, we do list the parking fee on our website as well as all of the third party booking sites (i.e. Booking.com, Expedia, Travelocity, etc). It is discounted for our guests to $10/night vs. paying directly in the gate. On a positive note, because you signed up for World of Hyatt, you were given complimentary parking for enrolling. We also further discount parking for our Members. 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out - I will be glad to assist you.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our survey.

I am so glad to hear that overall you had a positive stay. I am sorry that our parking information is not more clear on our website and that state/local hospitality taxes are not more clear. I will work with my team to ensure that we are explaining it better on our website as well as over the phone when guests book rooms at our property. On a positive note though, because you enrolled in World of Hyatt, you were not charged for parking. Also, as a goodwill gesture to our Members, we are typically offering discounted parking.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize that you room was not properly cleaned prior to your arrival and that it took a phone call to the desk to for a follow-up. I'm also sorry that your fridge was not working properly. I have spoken with our Executive Housekeeper and our Director of Engineering regarding your concerns so that they can follow up with our Teams to ensure the rooms are properly maintained and cleaned before every guest. I also know how frustrating it can be for elevators to be slow. Having to wait can be a hassle. 

As a goodwill gesture for your inconvenience, I have places a $50.00 credit on your account. You will see the refund processed on the credit card used at check-out in about 3-5 business days. Again, I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences you experienced.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for sharing your feedback in our survey. I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences you experienced during your stay.

I have already spoken with our Executive Housekeeper and our Director of Operations and we must do better. The state that your room was in when you arrived should have been spotless, clean, and inviting. From your email, it sounds like it was anything but. We will be working with the Housekeeper that was assigned to your room to ensure they have the proper training and that things are not missed in the cleaning process. We don't want our guests to ever feel uncomfortable during their stay.

As a goodwill gesture, I have submitted for 8,000 points to be added to your World of Hyatt account. This is the equivalent of 1-night in our hotel; however, these can be used at any Hyatt anywhere in the world. 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

I am so glad that overall you had a positive stay with us. However, I would appreciate an opportunity to learn more about your experience with our dining options and how you feel we may be better able to improve our service or menus. It has been a weird year for everyone as we work through the COVID-19 global pandemic.

Thank you for sharing your feedback in our guest survey. 

I sincerely apologize for the lack of cleanliness in your room. I have shared your concerns with our Executive Housekeeper; however, if you are willing, we would like to learn more. If you have details of where the room was not cleaned properly and what you had to re-clean, we would greatly appreciate that feedback. We will be working with our Housekeeping Team to ensure they are all properly trained and not missing things. We strive to provide a clean environment for all of our guests and when they're not, we want to be able to offer additional cleaning service and/or the opportunity to move rooms. 

If you have any additional notes for us, I look forward to reading them.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our survey.

I am sorry to hear that your billing was incorrect. When I look at your statement, I see your 1-night of accommodation, an early arrival fee, a late departure fee, and parking. When you checked in, we also advised of an authorization on your credit/debit card for incidentals. If there is something else incorrect about your bill, please contact us as soon as possible and we will do what we can to correct the error. I also apologize that it seemed like our team was pre-occupied and unable to assist with your concerns. I will be working with our staff to ensure that we are taking care of each and every guest's needs. 

If you would like to go through your final hotel bill or discuss anything else about your stay, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback about your stay.

I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences you experienced during your stay. I have already spoken to our Director of Food & Beverage about your interactions with Scott from Pub333. We pride ourselves in the fact that we are able to take care of our guests - and he definitely missed the mark. We are able to accommodate special dietary restrictions and he should have taken a moment to share those accommodations with you and listened to your needs. I would have been shocked as well to hear ""you might want to go elsewhere,"" too. We have addressed your concerns with him directly to ensure that he is properly trained in our processes. 

I have shared your concerns about your in-room refrigerator with our Director of Engineering and Engineering Team. They have made the proper adjustments and have shared the proper settings with our Housekeeping Team so that they are at the right temperature. I also would like to apologize for the placement of your room and that the smoking area was so close that it was getting into your room. I have spoken with our General Manager about possible areas to relocate that area so that it does not affect guest rooms. 

I appreciate you sharing your concerns with me so that we have an opportunity to learn from our missteps. We must work harder to ensure the experiences you had, don't happen again. We will do better.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize for the hot water issues you had in your room. I have passed your concerns to our Director of Engineering who has researched the concern with his team. Also, they are working with our elevator vendor to improve the service to our guest floors. I hope that other than those two concerns, you had an enjoyable stay.

Thank you for sharing your feedback in our survey. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you experienced during your stay.

I have spoken with our Executive Housekeeper and it has been addressed with the housekeeper that cleaned your room about how things should not be missed. We have also provided additional training to her so that this does not happen again. In regards to breakfast, I apologize that you were hung up on twice. Unfortunately at this time, we are not accepting phone orders for breakfast and have suspended our room service operation since the beginning of the pandemic. I have spoken to the front desk staff so that we better explain this during check-in. We hope that once we are back to normal operations that we can get our refurbishment of the hotel restarted. The original plan was to start in October 2020; however, due to the pandemic, we have postponed that until later this year or early 2022.

Again, I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. I will be glad to assist you.

Thank you for staying with us and for your feedback about your stay.

I am so glad to hear that your stay overall was a positive one. I sincerely apologize for the housekeeping concerns you mentioned and for your showerhead spraying towards the ceiling. I have spoken with both our Executive Housekeeper and our Director of Engineering about your concerns. We will be addressing the cleanliness concerns with our housekeepers so that little things like oranges and wrappers are not missed in the future. Also, I am excited to share that we do have plans for a refurbishment of the hotel and guest rooms. It was originally slated for 2020; however, the global pandemic has pushed many of our projects back. We are hoping that with some normalcy returning to the industry that we can get back on track for that to start at the end of 2021 or beginning part of 2022. 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. We look forward to welcoming you and your family back to Green Bay in the future.

I completely understand that everything I mentioned were minor but, hopefully, it just makes someone double check.   Sadly, others might be mean about things.
I would certainly stay again if in the area and hope that you are able to get the projects done soon.  It has been some year!
Thank you and have a great day!

Thank you for being our guest and choosing Hyatt Regency Green Bay. 

We appreciate you sharing your feedback so that we can properly address it with our colleagues. I truly apologize that you did not have a great experience overall, especially with the lack of service in our food & beverage outlets.  I know how frustrating it can be when other properties are not up to standard. As a courtesy, we have credited back $20 to your Visa on file. We took care of the parking and Market charges charged to your room. This will take approximately 3-5 business days to be refunded back to you, and I will send you a separate email with your receipt. 

Once again I apologize for the experience you had, as we strive to provide great service and experiences for all our guests. We hope that we impress you in the future and you give us another chance to make it right. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. 

Sincerely,

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback about your stay.

I sincerely apologize that your stay was not restful and that there were so many children running up and down the halls. We did have a large number of families over the weekend for a state gymnastic meet and while we advised parents and children of our noise policy, it can be a challenge during celebrations. I do know that our Security Team was busy working their way through the hotel trying to get everyone settled as much as they could. I have also spoke with our Director of Food & Beverage and Executive Chef about your concerns with breakfast. We want to create menus and pricing that provides a value to our guests and will make any appropriate changes to our menu wherever possible. 

In regards to your enrollment in World of Hyatt, like nearly all loyalty programs, as you stay and earn points, different promotions and benefits are added to your account. As a thank you for enrolling, we are offering an immediate benefit of discounted parking. You earn 5 points per eligible dollar. And, in 2021, Hyatt has made it twice as easy to move up in the program - with your first bump to Discoverist status being at only 5-nights at Hyatt Hotels (vs. previous years of 10-nights). As you move up, you earn things like complimentary upgrades, club access at hotels that have them, complimentary rooms, and waived resort fees at Hyatt Resorts. 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

2021-03-23 14:52:06] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Dear Mr. Quinn,

Thank you for your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize for the noisy neighbors your experienced during your stay and the miscommunication about the facemask policy in our hotel. I hope that our Security Team was notified so that they could have an opportunity to speak to neighboring rooms and quiet things down for you. I would like to explain our mask policy as well.

There is a mandate in the State of Wisconsin that facemasks be work inside buildings. Hyatt Hotels have an additional requirement that facemasks/coverings be worn in public areas and if guests choose not to, that we not check the guest in until further information can be gathered. We should have been able to provide a face shield for the guest to be worn. I understand that this was not provided and I apologize for that. If at that time, a guests declines to wear a facemask/covering, we would advise that guests without masks cannot utilize public spaces in the hotel and would be requested to quarantine in their guest room until departure. We do realize that this can be inconvenient. As an asthmatic myself, I have sometimes found masks to be a hindrance in my daily life. However, the policy is in place so that we can do our part to help end the global pandemic and get back to normal. I hope that you understand.

I have spoken with the front desk agent that checked you in so that should we encounter a similar situation, that we can be more tactful and explain the policy more clearly as not to cause frustration. 

Again, I sincerely apologize about the interaction that you had at the front desk. We hope that you and your family remain safe and healthy as we move closer to what we're hoping is the end of the global pandemic. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

                I just left you a voicemail. I was hoping that we could set something up tomorrow to touch base on the incident that happened at our hotel. Tomorrow would work best for the call, any time between 11am – 3pm. Please email me back and let me know if this work for you. If so I will reach out between those times, if I don’t hear back from you please expect a few calls. Hope you’re feeling better and look forward to talking with you soon.

Thank you for being our guest and providing feedback.  I will definitely share your comments with our Housekeeping and Engineering colleagues to insure better follow-up on room cleanliness and the pool (with so many guests, we have been testing chemicals more often).  We hope to soon add some sort of stayover service in rooms, in the meantime we have left a trash bag in each room for additional trash but know this is not a great solution.   We look forward your next stay.

I am sorry to hear that you were disappointed with your recent stay.   We certainly had a busy weekend with the gymnastics group.  We are making some changes to quiet hours to try and alleviate noise late into the evening.  We would love to have you back as our guest.  Please keep my contact information and let me know when you are returning, I would like to provide you an upgrade on your next stay.

Please note; staff was nice about it when we called and provided a fan. 
I did actually hear from several other people that their room was uncomfortably hot, so maybe it was an issue throughout.
Anyway, thanks for the follow up!

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey. We appreciate your World of Hyatt membership and for choosing Hyatt Regency Green Bay.

I am pleased to see you had a great stay overall and that you will continue to come back! However, I see that the overall food & beverage experience was less than satisfactory. Would you be able to provide more details from your experience? I also apologize for the lack of working order in the guest rooms. Our coffee pot does not require a pot or filter. It is designed so that you add the coffee packets with water in the machine, and use the paper coffee cups right away. I am sorry if this was not explained to you or had instructions on them.  

Please let me know if you have any additional questions or can assist you with future stays!

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback during your stay with me.

I sincerely apologize for the leftover Slim Jim and coffee grounds in your wet bar area. I appreciate you sharing that with me so that we could get it resolved quickly for you. I'm so glad that you're a World of Hyatt Member as well. Your feedback in surveys allows us to learn where we missed and what we can improve upon! Our Executive Housekeeper has already followed up with her team in morning meetings so that these kinds of things aren't missed.

If there is anything else you would like to share or discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out!

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski
Front Office Manager

Thank you for staying with us for the Wisconsin Hotel and Lodging Association Conference and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey!

I'm so glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay. I am sorry that the remote was not initially working in your room, but that you were able to get it working. I will have our Engineering Team take a look at the remotes in your room to ensure they are with working batteries and that there are cleared sensors. We appreciate you taking the time out of your day to share feedback so that we have an opportunity to know where our missteps may be and where we are hitting the mark.

We hope that you stay safe and if there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

2021-03-12 11:53:39] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Dear Ms. Nelson,

Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to share your feedback with us in our guest survey.

I am sorry to hear that your stay with us this past weekend was disappointing. We strive, even in a global pandemic, to provide a safe, positive, and comfortable experience for all of our guests. Unfortunately, there are times where we miss the mark. I am not sure whom you spoke with at our property that would have shared that room service is available - we have sadly had to suspend that service since March 2020. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience that you had to come downstairs to order meals. As we evaluated what services would be contactless, the recommendations we received from the State of Wisconsin and our corporate team at Hyatt determined our current process to be the best way to offer food service. 

While we are doing our best to monitor our guest areas and advise guests to follow the rules, we do not have a way to cover every inch of our hotel and stop guests at every point of their stay. We hope that our guests will choose to do the right thing. We have signs posted throughout the hotel, advise them of policies at check-in, and do our best to advises guests when we see them not following the recommendations put forth. 

In regards to the cleanliness of your guest room, I have spoke with our Executive Housekeeper about your concerns and we will be working with our Housekeeping Staff to ensure the rooms are properly cleaned. What you described should not have been missed. 

As a goodwill gesture for the inconveniences you experienced, I have applied a $100.00 credit to your account. You should see this reflected on your credit card statement in 5-7 business days. Again, I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences you experienced during your stay.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.  

Warm regards,

Paul Zagorski

It was a surprise birthday gift for my daughter. She’s never had room service and thinks that would just be the best thing ever. I was wondering if the Hyatt offered that right now, so I called a few days ahead of time to ask about that and the pool. I was told that room service is available on Friday and Saturday nights until 9pm. I was given correct information about pool hours and hot tub being closed. I chose the Hyatt, a more expensive option than other hotels I was considering, specifically for this reason. Paying more money is a sacrifice for us, but I thought it was worth it. When I called the front desk to ask about room service, I was told there was none available. When I said that I had called earlier to ask about this, the front desk staff had no idea what I was talking about. I know it doesn’t sound like a big deal, but I just wanted to do something nice for my daughter after a very difficult year even if it was a financial sacrifice for me to do so. 
A few other notes- our bathroom had hair on the walls, there was a strange white powder under the countertop of the kitchen, and streaming to the tv did not work. I was very disappointed with the way Covid restrictions were handled as well. Even though I did see signs posted, every time I got in the elevator, people would just get on so there were more than four people and numerous groups in the lobby were not wearing masks. I had to go down to the restaurant to order dinner and breakfast. I could not do it from my phone, which made this NOT a “contactless” experience. I would’ve liked to have seen some staff members around to remind people of the rules. As I said, I chose this hotel thinking that we would have room service and would not be exposed to so many people not wearing masks. I wish that I had had the correct information before I made the decision to spend the money to stay at this hotel.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,""""",,,,,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback about your stay.

I sincerely apologize for the behavior of other guests in our atrium and that it was not properly handled immediately. I have already spoken with my Front Desk Staff as to the proper protocol for advising guests of our COVID-19 policies and I have spoken to our Security Team about monitoring our atrium area. In the past year, we have done our best to enforce the mask recommendations put forth by the State of Wisconsin and Hyatt Hotels. Unfortunately, our staff has been met with resistance and from time-to-time struggles with ""catching"" every guest not following the protocols. As a hospitality organization, we also have to balance caring for our guests, too. We have provided nearly 6,000 masks to guests who have ""just forgot it"" or other reasons not to have them. I appreciate your understanding as we work to enforce our policy as best as we can. 

We hope that we are able to return to normal again soon as more people are vaccinated and we wish everyone would be as gracious as you and your family to follow the rules. 

If there is anything else we can do to assist you, please do not hesitate to reach out - I will be glad to assist you. 

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for staying with us and sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize that you experienced cold water in your shower, but I'm glad that our Engineers were able to get it a little bit better for you. In regards to our hot tub, sauna, and steam room - these are currently closed due to Covid-19. We are following recommendations by the State of Wisconsin and our Hyatt Corporate Team and have determined that our facility does not allow guests to be properly physically distanced from each other. We know that this is an inconvenience and apologize for that. What other hotels are offering is entirely up to them. We hope that everyone remains safe as we move through the global pandemic and hopefully return to normal operations soon where we can reopen the hot tub, sauna, and steam room. 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. I hope that you and your family are staying safe and healthy.

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback. 

I sincerely apologize that your smoke detector was chirping all night and that it was not resolved during your stay. I have spoken with my team that was here to assist our guests about ensuring that requests are followed up on. I am not sure in what part of our process to get our Engineering or Security Team to your room to replace the batteries something was missed but it was - for that, I am truly sorry.

In regards to our elevators, we are aware that in busy times, they can be slow. We are working on ways to improve their speed or modify the service to service button calls from certain floors. 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out - I will be glad to assist you.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize that your room was dusty upon arrival and that you had to wipe it down yourself. That should not have happened and I have spoken with our Executive Housekeeper to ensure that we are training our staff properly during the global pandemic or not to make sure our rooms are clean. You should be able to have a clean and inviting room when you stay with us. 

Also, I apologize that it was so warm in your room. Due to the system that was installed when the hotel was built in 1989, the entire building can be in heat mode or cooling mode. I'm sorry that the fan that was available to help kept falling over. While it's not ideal, we also advise guests to open their window some to help exhaust some of the heat until their room is at a comfortable temperature. In regards to our hot tub, it has been closed since March 2020 due to Covid-19. We are hoping that once we are able to move past the global pandemic and to normal operations that we can reopen our hot tub, sauna, and steam room. 

Because of all of the inconveniences, we have already placed 8,000 points on your World of Hyatt account. These points can be used at any Hyatt anywhere in the world. Again, I sincerely apologize for everything you experienced during your stay. I

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback in our guest survey. 

I sincerely apologize that your stay did not exceed your expectations. Breakfast is available for purchase daily between 7:00AM-10:00AM in our Atrium Breakfast Area. I apologize if this was miscommunicated to you and your party. Also, looking over your room statement, I do not see where you were overcharged. If you would like, I can send you a copy of your folio for your review. I see that you were charged only for room and tax and were given complimentary parking. Your room was $169.00+15.5% Wisconsin Sales & Hotel Tax. When you arrived, your credit card was authorized for an additional amount for a security hold and that was released upon check-out. 

Please let me know if you have any other billing concerns. I will be glad to assist you with them. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I am sorry to hear that the sheets in your room were uncomfortable and that it was noisy during your stay. I have spoke with our Executive Housekeeper to ensure there was not incorrect sheets ordered and put on our beds. I also apologize for the noise you experienced in your room. Over the weekend you were here, we were sold out with a number of sports teams, dance groups, gymnastic groups, and families who enjoyed each other's company in our atrium. While our Security Team did their best to control noise, it was still a challenge for us. 

We have already made adjustments to our operation so that when are anticipating large groups of families, we can open the KI Breakout Center or other non-Atrium locations for guests to congregate later into the evening. We strive to have quiet hours between 9:00PM and 7:00AM and work tirelessly throughout the night when there are noise complaints. 

Also, we do have an entire hotel refurbishment planned. Due to Covid-19, we had to push it back from starting in October 2020 to hopefully later in 2021 or early 2022. In the meantime, I have shared your message with our Head of Engineering to take a look at the room you were in to see what repairs can be made.

If there is anything else you would like to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. I will be glad to assist you. 

I hope that you and your family remain safe as we are hopefully at the end of the global pandemic and hope to welcome you back to Green Bay in the future. 

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback about your stay.

I'm so glad to hear that you appreciated our process for limit points of contact between guests and colleagues. However, I'm sorry to hear that the grab-n-go breakfast was not what you were expecting. I have shared your feedback with our Executive Chef and Director of Operations so that they can consider this for future groups that choose the pre-packaged breakfasts. We are in a constant state of change to create thoughtful experiences for our guests. 

I'm glad to hear that the rest of your stay was a positive one. We look forward to welcoming you and your family back to Green Bay in the future! If there's anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize for the miscommunication your experienced about the hours of operations for the amenities in our hotel and for the interaction you had with one of our Colleagues. Our Market is available 24-hours; however, certain items may not be available until a barista arrives at 7:00AM. I am also sorry that the available food options left something to be desired. Also, our pool hours are posted throughout the hotel and on the temporary sign on the door for 10:00AM-10:00PM due to our staff needing to sanitize the pool area. We are hoping that we are all able to move past this global pandemic sooner rather than later and return to normal operations. 

I also want you to know that we strive to provide the highest level of service for our guests and I will personally be speaking to the Colleague that you interacted with. It is disheartening to hear that one of employees was rude and I will be working to stop that behavior. Thank you for sharing. 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please to not hesitate to reach out. I will be glad to assist you.

Thank you for choosing to stay with us and for being a loyal World of Hyatt Globalist. Your honest feedback in our guest survey is greatly appreciated.

I sincerely apologize for the inconveniences you experienced during your stay with us. During the global pandemic, Hyatt Hotels shared a directive to remove anything from the room that was more than one-use or could be touched by multiple guests or colleagues to avoid the spread of COVID-19. At our property, we removed paper products and water bottles. It has helped us be more connected with our guests and has helped us reduce waste by over 60%. While we understand it is an inconvenience to have to request these items, we gladly deliver these items to our guest's rooms. We are trying to do our part to stop the spread of the pandemic and appreciate your understanding. As we slowly return to normal business we hope to add some of the amenities back to the rooms.

In regards to the heating and cooling - you were given correct information. Our property was built in 1989 with a two-pipe system for heating and cooling. This means that in the winter, the entire building is in heat mode and in warmer months, the entire building is in cooling mode. While we are able to control the level of heat with your in-room thermostat, there is not a way to turn on air conditioning. We are hoping that once we are able to return to normal and start our entire hotel renovation that we hoped to have completed by now but delayed due to the global pandemic, that we will have a more modern system to allow our guests to have even more control over their level of comfort. As a native Floridian, I understand how uncomfortable it can be to sleep in a warm room.

As a goodwill gesture for you inconveniences, I am placing 10,000 points on your World of Hyatt Account. This is equivalent to more than one night stay and can be used at any Hyatt in the world. 

I am truly sorry that your stay was not more comfortable. We hope that everyone stays safe and we move past this pandemic sooner rather than later so that travel can be easy and seamless as it once was. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please to not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for taking the time to explain the situation up there in Green Bay.   I really do appreciate that.  
I'm sure the antiquated heating and a/c is a challenge at times.  Hopefully it will be fixed once we get through the covid pandemic.
I greatly appreciate the points as well.

2021-03-09 05:41:22] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Dear Ms. Ruffin,

Thank you for staying with us and sharing your thoughtful feedback about your stay.

I sincerely apologize that the room you stayed in seemed to be improperly maintained. I have spoken with our Head of Engineering regarding your concerns and they will be addressed. We strive to give our guests clean, safe, and comfortable rooms. Reading your email, it sounds like we missed the mark and for that I am sorry. It's only through this kind of feedback that we can learn, change, and do better.

As a goodwill gesture for the inconveniences you experienced, I have applied a $25.00 credit to your room account. This will be refunded back to your credit card and you should see it posted in 3-5 business days. Again, I sincerely apologize that your room seemed improperly maintained and we hope that your future visits are more seamless and comfortable.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. 

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski
Front Office Manager

The main common space of the hotel was clean, tidy and what I would expect from a Hyatt. 

What was disappointing was the condition of the room. While it was clean and prepped for our arrival and stay, the renovation of the room (which it was clear the space must have been recently updated) was poorly done. Like very poorly done. The drywall around fixtures in the wall like the vent and sprinkle system had gaps all around them, the light fixture hanging on the wall was noticeably crooked, the carpet was not laid flat and had bumps throughout the space. The cabinetry was poorly stained and had water damage, as did the drywall in the bathroom next to the shower. Speaking of the shower, the water temperature never got above luke warm. In fact, I’m pretty sure the pool was warmer than the water coming out of the spiget in the shower. 

I have stayed at other Hyatt’s and aesthetically speaking our room missed the mark and did not meet what we had expected to see. 

It was a room that was comfortable to stay in and got the job done at the end of the day, but I expected more attention to detail in the finishes of the room. 

We stayed in 607 if you want to take a gander for yourself.",N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,""""",,,,,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey. We appreciate your World of Hyatt membership and for choosing Hyatt Regency Green Bay. 

I am pleased to see you had a great stay overall and that you will continue to come back! However, I see that the overall food & beverage experience was less than satisfactory. Would you be able to provide more details from your experience? I know how disappointing it can be with some of our limited food and beverage services.  Hopefully we are able to resume to normal operations soon!

We certainly appreciate your feedback and hope that we continue to impress you!

Thank you for staying with us recently and for sharing your feedback in our survey.

While I understand your frustration about parking in Green Bay, it is a common practice within the city. As a guest of our hotel, we discount parking for you and are under the cost of parking in the City of Green Bay parking structures or street parking. There are, from time to time, promotions that we offer our World of Hyatt Members. While there was not a specific promotion for the weekend you were with us, as a good will gesture, I will refund the cost of the parking to your credit card on file. I will also make a note on your profile so that we can work with you during future reservations and see if there is a promotion we can assist you with in regards to parking. You should see the credit on your account in 3-5 business days.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. I will be glad to answer any questions or concerns you may have. 

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey. We appreciate your World of Hyatt loyalty and choosing our hotel. I am pleased to see that you had a great stay overall! 

However, I apologize that the thermostat wasn't working properly and that water was leaking in the bathroom. We appreciate your feedback for the concern and we have addressed it with our head of Engineering. Hopefully this does not happen in any of your future stays and that everything is in working order. I hope that you and your family stay safe.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey!

I apologize for the lack of cleanliness in the guest bathroom, I have addressed your concern with our housekeeping department and we will certainly prevent it from happening again.  While we try to keep everything in clean, sometimes things get missed. It is embarrassing and I am sorry that your experience was less than ideal.

Also, I would like to address your concern with our Hot Tub. Due to COVID-19 we have updated some of our services and operations. With the limited space in there, we are trying to ensure we don't maximize our limited capacity. I know how disappointing it is that some of our amenities have been closed. The global pandemic has created a very unique problem for hotels and we are doing our best to keep our guests and colleagues safe. 

We are trying our best to provide great experiences, no matter what circumstance affects our services. Once again, I apologize if your stay was less than satisfactory due to these inconveniences. I hope you and your family stay safe and that we all get through the pandemic soon so we can resume our normal operations. 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.


Sincerely,

Thank you for staying with us and sharing your feedback in our guest survey. 

I sincerely apologize that your stay was less than satisfactory and I appreciate you sharing details about your stay so that we have an opportunity to improve. 

First, I apologize with the lack of offering with our amenities and if it was not communicated properly. Due to COVID-19 updates and services, we have limited our daily housekeeping service with the guest rooms. At this time, we are offering housekeeping cleaning by request and we certainly would have cleaned your room in between your stay, although I apologize if this was not the case. Also, I see that breakfast was included with your rate and I'm sorry that you were not able to enjoy breakfast in the morning due to our hours. Our Market serves 24 hours daily for grab and go items, if you find yourself in our hotel in the future we can arrange complimentary coffee or pastry before you leave for work before 7am.

I have addressed your concern with our Front Desk staff about not properly communicating our parking procedure. I see that you had a reduced parking fee and we definitely would not want our guests to pay a daily rate at the gate. Once again, I apologize for the lack of satisfaction with your stay. I know how frustrating it can be with these type of issues and hopefully won't happen again for future stays.

 I hope that you give us another opportunity and stay at Hyatt Regency Green Bay. If there is anything you wish to discuss, please not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback about your stay.

I sincerely apologize that the blanket was not clean in your room. I have spoken with our Executive Housekeeper who is working with their team to ensure clean and inspected blankets are put inside the rooms. I apologize that we did not get an additional blanket sent to your room if you requested one. We would have been able to replace that at a moments notice. 

I have also spoken with our Head of Engineering about the KI Center and the heating system. They are working to resolve any concerns with the heating system. Unfortunately, the polar temperatures did not help the situation and I apologize that it was cold in your meeting space. 

I appreciate you sharing your feedback with us so that we have an opportunity to improve for your future visits. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for staying with us and sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize that you were disappointed in the amenities that we currently offer as we continue to fight through the global pandemic. I have reached out to our website team so that our COVID-19 policies can be placed in a more promenent place on our site. There has been pandemic related information on our site since the pandemic started last year and that information has stated that we have limited services available. Sadly, the global pandemic has forced us to close our hot tub, sauna, steam room, and suspend our shuttle service in an abundance of caution for our guests and colleagues. We are doing our best trying to combat COVID-19 with mask requirements, extensive cleaning protocols, and social distancing; while we also balance guests travelling to Green Bay.

We hope that we are all on the downward slide towards the end of COVID-19 and that we can resume normal operations again. We would love to reopen all of our amenities again soon for our guests and appreciate your understanding for the modifications to our operation.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss at this time, please do not hesitate to reach out - I will be glad to assist you.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback.

I sincerely apologize that you experienced so many challenges during your stay. I have spoken with our Food & Beverage Manager,  Head of Engineering, and Head of Security about your concerns. 

First, your breakfast experience should have been better and you should not have had to have such a long wait. With the unpredictability in our business due to COVID-19, we were unprepared for the spike in reservations we received on Friday and Saturday. We are thankful that guests are choosing to stay with us and we will be modifying our operation so that we are better staffed moving forward. Second, because of how busy it was and guests choosing to not adhere to our recommendations for the pool area, the pool did get busy. We will be considering having sign-ups for the pool area and monitoring it more closely. We are even considering that if guests choose not to comply, that we'll have no choice but to close the pool area early. Third, our Engineering Team is working to find the root cause as to why guests were having hot water issues. It is the first time in over a year that we experienced water issues. Aside from the sub-zero temperatures outside, our Engineers seem to be puzzled but are working diligently to resolve the concern.

As a  goodwill gesture for your inconvenience, I have applied a $40.00 credit to your room account. You will see this reflected in your credit card statement, if you view it online, in 3-7 business days. I know how disappointing it can be to travel and not have the experience your expecting - or that we strive to provide. I hope that we make the proper adjustments to our operation and that your next stay is more streamlined. 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for sharing your feedback with us in our guest survey.

I fully agree with you that your room should have been thoroughly cleaned prior to your arrival.  I have spoken with our Executive Housekeeper who will be working with her team to ensure that the details are not missed moving forward. We strive to provide a safe and clean environment for our guests and when things get missed, it gives us the opportunity to work even harder so that it does not happen again. 

I hope that your future stays are more streamlined and that this does not happen in the future. We will be working to ensure our team's training and protocols are being met. 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback with us in our guest survey.

We appreciate you telling us about your thermostat. With the extreme sub-zero temperatures over the past week, it can be a challenge to keep some rooms at a constant temperature. I have shared your feedback with our Head of Engineering so that the concern can be addressed. We want our guest to stay comfortably and have other means to help with that - space heaters and extra blankets. I'm sorry that it was a challenge to get your room to a comfortable temperature. 

I hope that your future stays are more comfortable. Please do not hesitate to reach out if there is anything else you wish to share with us.

2021-02-17 13:58:43] Email received from: Tiara Harrell <tormond0128@gmail.com>: Hi Paul,
Well, it was another Mother than also mentioned the same.  I noticed that
no matter what I put the thermostat on each time I stayed it was the same
result.
I am anemic, so I tend to keep my room a little warmer. I like 74 degrees.
I can put the thermostat to 80, and it wouldn’t go over 70, 0r 71 max.
So, it was just something that I noticed that it stayed around 69/70 both
times I was there.
It wasn’t an extreme nuisance, because I did remember to bring my heating
pad/electronic blanket just in case this time. Other than that the hotel is
great.
Kindly,
Tiara

2021-02-17 11:59:30] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Dear Ms. Steffes,

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your honest feedback.

I sincerely apologize that your room did not seem like it was cleaned properly and that all of our amenities were not operational. I have spoken with our Executive Housekeeper who went to check the room and while it was not black mold, there was some debris that should have been cleaned prior to your arrival. I would also like to apologize for the water pressure and temperature concerns you experienced. Our Engineering Team was doing everything in their power to ensure our guests had hot water, but with the sub-zero temperatures, we had some moments where we missed the mark. 

In regards to room service, due to COVID-19, we have suspended that offering as we are trying to reduce points of contact between our guests and colleagues. We are hoping that once we're able to return to normal operations, that we can bring back room service for our guests.

Because of the inconveniences you experienced during your stay, I have applied a $30.00 credit to your account. You should see the refund in 5-7 business days on your Discover credit card. I am sorry that your experience was more stressful than it was relaxing. We hope that once we're through the global pandemic, we are able to welcome you back and your experience will be more seamless.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

2021-02-16 18:22:16] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Dear Mr. Johnston,

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize that your stay with us was disappointing. I appreciate you sharing details about your stay so that we have an opportunity to improve. First, I would like to address your concerns that we were hiding information from our guests until they arrive. Hyatt.com has our COVID-19 updates and states what had limited operation and our parking policy. Our parking gates also have our parking fees posted in addition to explaining parking at check-in. I know how disappointing it is that some of our amenities have been closed due to COVID-19. The global pandemic has created a very unique problem for hotels and we are doing our best to keep our guests and colleagues safe. 

Second, I have spoken with our Head of Engineering and I'm sorry that it was a struggle to keep your room at a comfortable temperature and that your balcony door did not close and lock properly. Our Engineering Department will be addressing those concerns. They will also be addressing the air filter in the room you were in. While we try to keep everything in working and clean order, sometimes things get missed. It is embarrassing and I am sorry that your experience was less than ideal. Once we are able to move past the global pandemic, I hope that we will be able to get back on tract to start our refurbishment. Our goal is to upgrade our rooms, our televisions, the windows and sliders. 

As a goodwill gesture for your inconvenience, your parking was waived and a discount was applied to your account prior to check out. I hope that in the future, once we are able to complete our refurbishments, that we have another opportunity to impress you. I hope that you and your family stay safe and that we all get through the pandemic soon.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Or in this case because only the pool was open I would have just gone somewhere else and saved myself $30 a day and got more amenities. I recommended to people not to go to this hotel but Togo somewhere else and I would never refer this one to anyone. You had a really good breakfast and that's about it.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback on our survey.

I sincerely apologize that your room was cold and that you had to purchase a space heater. I have looked through our records and I apologize if my staff did not enter in requests for Engineering to bring you an additional heater, fix your thermostat, and brink you extra blankets to keep you comfortable. We have extra items on hand for our guests so that we can fix opportunities when guests bring them to our attention.

I also wish that in the few conversations that we had during your stay, that you had brought your concerns to my attention so that we could have resolved this prior to you and your travel companion departing the hotel. I appreciated your kind and thoughtful words of encouragement as you witnessed different guest interactions during your stay. 

While we strive for seamless, comfortable experiences for our guests, sometimes things go wrong. As a goodwill gesture, I will be applying a $30.00 credit to your room account. You will see this reflected in your credit card statement in 3-7 business days. 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. I hope that your future stays are more comfortable and I look forward to welcoming you back to Green Bay soon.

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

2021-01-28 06:59:26] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Dear Ms. Courtright,

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our guest survey.

I sincerely apologize that the thermostat was not working properly in your room. I have spoken with our Engineers so that they can take a look at it and figure out the problem with it. Unfortunately, we have a two-pipe system in our hotel. Either the entire building is in heat or cooling mode and the thermostat controls the fans in the room. In order to make it cooler, we can turn off the fans from our computer system - that prevents more hot air from coming into the room. We are hoping that in our refurbishment, this will be updated so that if guests wish to have the air conditioning on in the winter, it is possible and will give our guests more control in their room comfort.

In regards to your dining experience, thank you for the compliment! I will ensure that Scott is recognized for his service and managing things on his own. We appreciate you recognizing our staff and definitely look forward to welcoming you back in the future!

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski
Front Office Manager

Thank you for staying with us. It's always a pleasure to welcome you to Green Bay for your stays.

I appreciate you sharing your feedback and notes about the carpet in your room. I have notified our Engineering Team so that they can fix it as soon as possible. We are hoping that once things return to normal, that we can start our refurbishment project. 

We look forward to your next visit! If there's anything we can do to assist you, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our survey.

I sincerely apologize that you received conflicting information during your stay about why Saturday night wasn't available, why the pathway through the KI Convention Center was closed, and your ability to utilize the lobby. It was a learning experience for us in what information we can/cannot share to maintain guest privacy and the groups that choose to buyout the entire hotel. I will be working with my staff so that in the future should we experience an event like this again, that we are sharing a consistent message with our guests. 

We understand that there were moments of inconvenience that you experienced and appreciate your understanding. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

I am sorry to hear that your stay was not as enjoyable or comfortable as we strive for at Hyatt. I would like an opportunity, if you are willing, to learn more about your experience and what we could have done to make your stay better. Please feel free to reach out to me. I will be out of the hotel on Monday and Wednesday; however, I will be able to respond to emails as well all week.

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our survey.

I appreciate your thoughtful responses and understand your frustrations. We strive to provide a safe and comfortable environment for all of our guests with amenities that meet our guest's needs. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has forced us to completely revisit our operations and what is available and when. Sadly, our occupancy has been under 30% for most of the last year and with the last minute announcement that fans would be able to go to the Green Bay Packer game against the Los Angeles Rams, we were not prepared for the influx of guests to our property. Had we stayed open, we would have sacrificed service. It appears; however, that was still a misstep on our part. I sincerely apologize that did not have food operations after the game and appreciate your understanding as we are still in the middle of a global pandemic.

As for your additional comments, your weekend was the first weekend we had our hot tub open since March 28th of last year. We tested it to ensure a safe operation and temperature and our Engineering Team has been following up to modify what they need to. I'm sorry that the pool area was so busy. I have spoken to our Head of Security so that we will be better prepared moving forward and have better control over how many guests are in the pool area. We want all of our guests to feel safe at our hotel.

Lastly, we do value your membership in World of Hyatt. For your stay, you earned 5 point per dollar spent. As you earn points, you move your way towards complimentary upgrades and free nights at Hyatt properties around the world. It is disheartening to hear that we did not make you feel valued and I will be working with my staff at the front desk, as well as other managers in the hotel, to modify our interactions to that we do make our guests feel special and part of our family.

My hope is that we are able to move through this pandemic and that your future stays are more streamlined and comfortable. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

2021-01-22 09:54:01] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Dear Mr. Lund,

Thank you for staying with us this past weekend and for sharing your detailed feedback with us. 

I sincerely apologize that your stay was not as seamless and hospitable as we strive for at Hyatt. I was looking over your reservation booked through Priceline.com and I checked with our partners there to see if they were offering a free parking promotion. I'm not sure where that information was shared with you, but I apologize on behalf of Priceline.com for the incorrect information. On their website, it is listed that ""Private parking is available on site (reservation is not needed) and costs USD 10 per day."" At the front desk, we have been offering complimentary parking to new members of World of Hyatt and we greatly appreciate you signing up. World of Hyatt is a great way to earn complimentary upgrades, free dining, and other great amenities when staying at Hyatt properties around the world. 

I have shared your feedback with our Engineering Team in regards to your HVAC system in your room. The building is a two-pipe system and in heat mode - it should have been getting warmer for you. I hope that if you contacted the front desk, my team sent up a space heater to help bridge the gap. COVID-19 unfortunately has pushed our plan hotel refurbishment back to the end of 2021 or early 2022 and we hope that our new HVAC system will be better set up to make our guest rooms comfortable.

Lastly, I would like to apologize for my staff not making you feel cared for and giving you the experience that we are just another hotel. I will be speaking with my front desk staff and others around the hotel on ways we can improve our guest interactions. We want you to feel like family here, not that you are a transaction. We want to ensure we're explaining what is and is not open during these trying times when our operation is changing on a near daily basis. Balancing keeping our guests safe and comfortable while being friendly should go hand in hand. 

Thank you again for sharing your feedback. If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out. 

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback. 

I sincerely apologize that your stay was not more enjoyable. I understand how frustrating it can be when you expect a seamless stay at a hotel and get something that is anything but seamless. Sometimes, even with ""all hands on deck"" we are still cross-utilizing housekeepers in breakfast, our sales team in housekeeping, and our front desk staff as baristas. I'm sorry to hear that our front desk staff wasn't able to clarify our amenities and the operation hours as well. We do have modified hours for fitness center and the signs are posted there. Unfortunately, the sign that was posted had the pool hours on it. Our gym is open from 6:00AM-10:00PM daily. I apologize that that was not correct and that you had to go to another local gym for your workout. 

I'm also sorry to hear that your room did not have hot water in the shower. Over the course of the weekend, we had no other complaints of cold water in the rooms - our Engineering Team has taken a look and they were not able to determine a concern so they replaced the entire knob section. 

We were so excited for our first ""busy"" weekend since the pandemic started and our staff was ready to put their best foot forward. I'm sorry to hear that we missed the mark but value your feedback so we can be prepared better once things are back to normal. 

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.

The staff were amazing. The hotel is prob older and the room carpets were
puffed up in bedroom needs stretching. Bed is not comfortable and bathroom
was too small. Cold draft was comming to the room through front door that

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback in our Guest Survey. We appreciate you being an Explorist with World of Hyatt and your loyalty to the Hyatt family of hotels.

I am glad to hear that your room was comfortable and peaceful. I sincerely apologize though that our policy and procedure for fighting COVID-19 made you uncomfortable. We are currently following State of Wisconsin mandates and Hyatt restrictions regarding the wearing of masks and protocols for cleaning our property. This pandemic has not been good for anyone and we are trying our best to keep our guests and colleagues safe and navigate through all of the new restrictions placed upon everyone. 

Our guest room carpets are cleaned on a regular basis but I would agree it is time for an upgrade. We finished our lobby upgrades in early 2020 and look forward to the next phase in 2021 or early 2022. 

We are constantly working to improve the level of service we provide during these times and I will definitely take this opportunity to tweak how we interact with guests in regards to the pandemic.

Good morning and thank you for responding to our survey regarding your stay.  

“Customer service was good. Hot tub wouldn't stay on longer then 2 minutes. I thought the breakfast was included and was the charged 34 dollars, I even asked ahead of time. And the found out we had to pay for parking which I didnt understand. Very beautiful hotel though.”

I have attached a copy of your bill to this e-mail.  I do see there was a small charge for breakfast of $.39 that I will have adjusted today (this is a system glitch and should have been caught prior to checking out your room), but I see no other charges other than for the room and parking.  I will look into the Hot Tub, thank you for letting me know.  The hot tub area just re-opened this weekend,  it has been under renovation since March.    Evidently something is not working properly.  When tested last week over a 3 day period , it was working great.  

I hope you will consider staying with us again, we look forward to welcoming you back.

2021-01-11 06:04:04] Reply Sent: Click here to respond: Dear Ms. Felton,

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback about your stay. 

I'm glad to hear that overall, your stay was a positive one and that the service you received was positive. I sincerely apologize that your room was not as comfortable as we strive to provide at our property. Our rooms are inspected by our Engineering Team regularly for working order and I have spoken with them to ensure that the heating system is working appropriately in that room. Sometimes, when the air is cooler outside, unfortunately the only step to getting the temperature to increase is by adding space heaters in the room. I'm glad that my team was able to assist you with that.

I hope that your future stays with us are more comfortable. If there is anything else you wish to discuss with us, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for staying with us and for sharing your feedback. We appreciate your loyalty to the Hyatt family and for being an Explorist with World of Hyatt. 

I sincerely apologize that you experienced issues with your room. I have shared your feedback with our Executive Housekeeper and our Director of Engineering so that they can work with their teams to improve our guest's experience. We strive to create comfortable and clean rooms that are always working for our guests and I'm sorry that your room did not meet that expectation. I can assure you that we will do better and appreciate you sharing this information so we can learn.

As a goodwill gesture, I am crediting you 8,000 World of Hyatt points to your account - the equivalent of 1-night at our property. You should see this reflected in your account in 3-5 business days. 

If there is anything else we can do to assist you, please do not hesitate to reach out. 

Sincerely,

Paul Zagorski

Thank you for your very prompt, courteous and thorough response - an example of Hyatt’s excellent staff service.
 I appreciate the generous credit to my husband’s WOH account but I was not expecting any kind of compensation for the issues I listed.  We have certainly experienced much more significant problems in non-Hyatt properties over the years.  We believe that Hyatt is dedicated to offering the best, regardless of whether it’s a Hyatt Place or an Andaz.  So I took the time to point out some things that could be improved in the room we had.  I guess you're right in saying that we are loyal to the Hyatt family.
Best wishes to you and your staff for the New Year.  It has to be better than the last one!
Mary Meyer (and Gordon Haugan)

Thank you for staying with us and happy new year. 

I sincerely appreciate your feedback about our check-in process and apologize that it was not a streamlined process upon arrival. There are still some tweaks being made to the World of Hyatt app and our online check-in process so that mobile keys can be made and room assignments can be selected where you can completely avoid the front desk. I have forward your message to our World of Hyatt Application Support Team in hopes the right improvements can be made. 

We understand how important it is for contactless options and will work hard to improve those for our guests.

If there is anything else you wish to discuss, please do not hesitate to reach out.
