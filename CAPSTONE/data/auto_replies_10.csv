"Couple of items, the temperature in our room, 832, would not warm up, it was around 67 deg the entire stay. The fan ran constantly and was fairly loud. I did not mention during our stay because I didn’t want the hassle of someone in and out of our room, and or having to change rooms. The next was a leak in the main roof outside of our room in the corner of the courtyard near room 832, water was dripping pretty fast. This did not effect us as it was outside our room but not a great look for the hotel. We did the buffet, the food was very mediocre, i thought the potatoes were cold and greasy. The omlettes and fruit were good. It took quite a while to get our bill even though it was it not overly crowded. if we stay here again we will not eat the buffet. As long as I am filling this out I will mention the parking, validating the parking all the time is a pain, can’t it somehow be piggyback with the room key.",Slightly Negative,understanding and mildly apologetic,"Dear Guest,
Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. We're truly sorry to hear about the issues you encountered during your stay at our hotel in Room 832.
Firstly, regarding the heating issue in your room, we deeply apologize for any discomfort caused due to an improper room temperature. Our team will thoroughly investigate the matter and take immediate action to ensure such occurrences do not happen again.

We also acknowledge the noise level from the fan and understand that it may have affected your sleep quality. Rest assured, we will replace the unit with a quieter model to enhance your overall comfort.
Regarding the leaking roof in the courtyard, we sincerely apologize for any aesthetic impact this might have had on your stay. Our maintenance department has already"
"The food in the restaurant was over salted, under cooked and some of it was cold. We waited for more than an hour to be served once our order was placed. The staff was nice and the manager came out and apologized but never once did he ever offer us any sort of compensation. Maybe a free dessert or drinks or even a % off the bill.  Unsatisfactory, will not eat there again, they have lost our service for stays in the future.",Negative,apologetic and solution-focused,"Dear Guest,
Thank you for taking the time to share your recent dining experience at our restaurant with us. I'm truly sorry to hear that the meal did not meet your expectations. It is unfortunate when dishes may be undercooked, over-seasoned, or served cold, as we strive to provide every guest with high-quality meals prepared to their satisfaction. Additionally, waiting for extended periods can understandably impact the overall enjoyment of one's dining experience.
I appreciate your kind words about the hospitality displayed by our team members; however, it seems that the lack of follow-up action on this matter left you feeling unattended to. Our policy includes offering compensations such as complimentary items or discounts on the bill when issues like these arise, so I am disappointed to learn that this wasn't extended during your visit. Rest assured, we will address this oversight internally to ensure that guests receive appropriate care moving forward."
"We ordered room service - which we rarely do.  When we checked out, we were surprised there was a $13.19 buffet charge on our $43.80 breakfast room service bill (for which we had a receipt).  Not sure if someone erroneously charged a buffet meal to our room or ???  It was corrected, but in the future we probably won't put our credit card on file for ""incidentals"" to avoid this.  Also, hoping the room we were in will get its table back.  Was awkward to eat without it.",Very Positive,enthusiastic and grateful,"Dear Guest,
Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. I appreciate your honesty and am sorry to hear about the confusion regarding the unexpected charge on your room service bill during your stay.
I understand that finding such an error can be concerning, especially when it involves charges to your account. Please know that we take these matters very seriously and have thoroughly investigated the issue. Our records indicate that the buffet charge was indeed an error and has been promptly rectified. Rest assured, we value your satisfaction above all else and apologize sincerely for any inconvenience caused.
As for the missing table in your room, I completely agree that it would make dining more enjoyable. I've passed along your suggestion to our housekeeping team so they may ensure tables are returned post-cleaning where applicable.

Disappointed that someone knocked on our door Christmas morning @ 8:06 am to clean room. We told them to come back. Then we also told the front desk attendant that we would like our room cleaned while we were out for a good 7 hours from 11AM to 6 PM. We came back to an unattended room.   We checked in on Sunday before Christmas  and left Wednesday after Christmas .,Very Negative,deeply apologetic and committed to resolution,"Dear Guest,
Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us during your recent stay at our hotel. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by the early cleaning service visit on Christmas Morning. It is never our intention to disrupt guests' peaceful moments or celebrations.
We understand your preference for having your room serviced during specific hours, which was communicated both through the note left in your room and the conversation with our front desk staff member. Unfortunately, it appears there may have been a miscommunication between teams regarding your requested schedule.
To make up for this oversight, we would be delighted to offer you a complimentary upgrade to a premium suite for the remainder of your stay as well as a $50 dining credit for one of our restaurants. In addition, we will ensure all team members involved are made aware of this incident so they can better understand our guests' preferences when scheduling housekeeping services moving forward."

"Wonderful stay!  We stopped in the bar our first night and it was pretty dead in there (right before Christmas), but the bartender was awesome and we all watched Elf together :)
The room was great as usual, just like I remembered from my childhood, but updated!
We didn't have the breakfast there because it's a bit different than we remembered.  It's now an additional charge to the room and the set up is different.  I'm sure it's tasty but we opted out of it.",Positive but Critical,appreciative but attentive to concerns,"Dear Guest,

I wasn’t notified about $7 parking fee until check in. Couldn’t find anything about it on website nor was the info provided when making the reservation.

"We specifically asked at check in what time breakfast was served and the desk person said 7 am to 10 am.  We got to the buffet at 9:30 the next morning and we're told it cloed at 9:30 and they would not serve us.  When I complained at checkout the girl at the desk said, ""I'm sorry about that.  Our breakfast is really good!"". Not pleased with the misinformation and the response I got.",Positive but Critical,appreciative but attentive to concerns,"Dear Guest,
