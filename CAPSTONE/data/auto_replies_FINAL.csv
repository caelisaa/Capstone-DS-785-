"Couple of items, the temperature in our room, 832, would not warm up, it was around 67 deg the entire stay. The fan ran constantly and was fairly loud. I did not mention during our stay because I didnâ€™t want the hassle of someone in and out of our room, and or having to change rooms. The next was a leak in the main roof outside of our room in the corner of the courtyard near room 832, water was dripping pretty fast. This did not effect us as it was outside our room but not a great look for the hotel. We did the buffet, the food was very mediocre, i thought the potatoes were cold and greasy. The omlettes and fruit were good. It took quite a while to get our bill even though it was it not overly crowded. if we stay here again we will not eat the buffet. As long as I am filling this out I will mention the parking, validating the parking all the time is a pain, canâ€™t it somehow be piggyback with the room key.",Very Negative,deeply apologetic and committed to resolution,"Dear Guest,
I apologize for the inconveniences experienced during your stay at our hotel. We deeply regret the difficulty adjusting the room temperature and the noise from the fan. I understand your concern about disturbances in your room, and we appreciate your patience in not bringing it to our attention immediately. To rectify this issue, please let me know when you might return so we can address any HVAC concerns beforehand.
We also noticed the leaking roof in the courtyard by Room 832 and acknowledge its impact on appearance. Our maintenance team has been alerted to repair the leak promptly.
Regarding the buffet experience, thank you for sharing your thoughts on various dishes. While we're glad to hear you enjoyed some aspects such as omelets and fruit, we sincerely hope to improve upon other menu offerings, particularly the potatoes and overall speed of service.
Lastly, regarding validation of parking,"
"The food in the restaurant was over salted, under cooked and some of it was cold. We waited for more than an hour to be served once our order was placed. The staff was nice and the manager came out and apologized but never once did he ever offer us any sort of compensation. Maybe a free dessert or drinks or even a % off the bill.  Unsatisfactory, will not eat there again, they have lost our service for stays in the future.",Very Negative,deeply apologetic and committed to resolution,"I'm truly sorry to hear about your recent dining experience at our restaurant. Over-salting, undercooking, and serving cold dishes isn't up to our usual standards, and we deeply regret the wait as well. Our goal is always to make sure every meal leaves you satisfied and looking forward to returning.
While I understand that the apology from the manager might have helped somewhat, I'd love to discuss ways we can make this right for you. Perhaps offering a complimentary dessert, drinks, or even a discount on your next visit would help restore your confidence in our services. Could you please share your reservation details so we can follow up directly?
We value your patronage and hope you'll consider giving us another chance to impress you. Thank you for taking the time to provide constructive feedback – it helps us learn and improve!"
"We ordered room service - which we rarely do.  When we checked out, we were surprised there was a $13.19 buffet charge on our $43.80 breakfast room service bill (for which we had a receipt).  Not sure if someone erroneously charged a buffet meal to our room or ???  It was corrected, but in the future we probably won't put our credit card on file for ""incidentals"" to avoid this.  Also, hoping the room we were in will get its table back.  Was awkward to eat without it.",Negative,apologetic and solution-focused,"I'm sorry for any inconvenience caused by the unexpected buffet charge on your recent room service order. We appreciate your patience while we rectified the issue. To prevent such occurrences in the future, please let us know ahead of time if you plan to use room service so we can ensure accurate billing. Additionally, rest assured that we'll look into returning the missing table to your room as soon as possible. Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention, and we hope to serve you better during your next stay."
Disappointed that someone knocked on our door Christmas morning @ 8:06 am to clean room. We told them to come back. Then we also told the front desk attendant that we would like our room cleaned while we were out for a good 7 hours from 11AM to 6 PM. We came back to an unattended room.   We checked in on Sunday before Christmas  and left Wednesday after Christmas .,Negative,apologetic and solution-focused,"Apologies for the inconvenience caused during your stay. It was unfortunate that housekeeping interrupted your peaceful Christmas morning. We appreciate your patience when speaking with both the cleaning staff and the front desk about scheduling a more suitable time for room service.
We apologize again for missing your preference for extended cleanup hours (11 AM - 6 PM). Please accept this message as a gesture of goodwill towards making up for this oversight during your visit. We hope any future stays will meet all expectations and provide memorable experiences.
Merry belated Christmas!"
I was so happy you let dogs stay!  My dog is cleaner than my infant and think $100 per stay is still too much.,Neutral,balanced and professional,"Delighted to hear you enjoyed bringing your furry companion along! We appreciate your kind words about our pet policy. To address your concern regarding the fee, we understand this can be an additional expense, but it helps cover extra cleaning costs associated with pets. Let's discuss potential ways to offer more affordable rates while maintaining high standards for all guests. Looking forward to welcoming both you and your pup again soon!"
"Wonderful stay!  We stopped in the bar our first night and it was pretty dead in there (right before Christmas), but the bartender was awesome and we all watched Elf together :)
The room was great as usual, just like I remembered from my childhood, but updated!
We didn't have the breakfast there because it's a bit different than we remembered.  It's now an additional charge to the room and the set up is different.  I'm sure it's tasty but we opted out of it.",Very_Positive,professional and courteous,"Delighted to hear you enjoyed your recent stay with us! The bartender indeed went above and beyond by turning a quiet evening into a memorable Elf movie marathon – what a treat! We appreciate your positive remarks about the room as well.
Regarding the changes to our breakfast service, we apologize if this wasn't quite what you were expecting. While we understand this may differ from previous experiences, we hope you can explore other dining options during your future visits. Thank you once again for taking the time to share your thoughts and we look forward to welcoming you back soon!"
I wasnâ€™t notified about $7 parking fee until check in. Couldnâ€™t find anything about it on website nor was the info provided when making the reservation. This is first experience Iâ€™ve had with any hotel where they werenâ€™t upfront about parking costs online and during reservation process.,Very Negative,deeply apologetic and committed to resolution,"We're truly sorry for this inconvenience. It seems our current system could improve regarding transparency over parking fees. To ensure future guests have a better experience, we will make sure to clearly state all charges related to parking before booking. Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention."
"We specifically asked at check in what time breakfast was served and the desk person said 7 am to 10 am.  We got to the buffet at 9:30 the next morning and we're told it cloed at 9:30 and they would not serve us.  When I complained at checkout the girl at the desk said, ""I'm sorry about that.  Our breakfast is really good!"". Not pleased with the misinformation and the response I got.",Negative,apologetic and solution-focused,"I apologize for the inconvenience experienced during your stay regarding our breakfast hours. Despite being informed upon check-in that breakfast serves from 7 am - 10 am, we regretfully closed earlier than stated. We understand this may have caused frustration when you arrived at 9:30 am. To make up for this oversight, we will provide a complimentary breakfast voucher for another visit or offer an alternative accommodation arrangement if preferred. We deeply value your satisfaction and aim to improve communication around meal services. Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention."
