"Couple of items, the temperature in our room, 832, would not warm up, it was around 67 deg the entire stay. The fan ran constantly and was fairly loud. I did not mention during our stay because I didnâ€™t want the hassle of someone in and out of our room, and or having to change rooms. The next was a leak in the main roof outside of our room in the corner of the courtyard near room 832, water was dripping pretty fast. This did not effect us as it was outside our room but not a great look for the hotel. We did the buffet, the food was very mediocre, i thought the potatoes were cold and greasy. The omlettes and fruit were good. It took quite a while to get our bill even though it was it not overly crowded. if we stay here again we will not eat the buffet. As long as I am filling this out I will mention the parking, validating the parking all the time is a pain, canâ€™t it somehow be piggyback with the room key.",Very Negative,deeply apologetic and committed to resolution,"Dear Guest,
Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. I'm truly sorry about the issues encountered during your stay at our hotel. Let me address each point raised:
1. Room Temperature & Fan Noise: I apologize for the inconvenience caused by the cooler temperatures and noisy fan in room 832. Our maintenance team should have ensured a comfortable environment for guests. To prevent future occurrences, they will inspect and adjust the heating system accordingly.
2. Roof Leakage: I appreciate your understanding regarding the minor leak in the courtyard. While it did not impact your stay, we understand that it may have affected other guests or created an undesirable impression. Rest assured, we are aware of this matter and plan to repair the damaged area promptly.
3. Buffet Quality: Thank you for providing valuable insights into the quality of our buffet offer"
"The food in the restaurant was over salted, under cooked and some of it was cold. We waited for more than an hour to be served once our order was placed. The staff was nice and the manager came out and apologized but never once did he ever offer us any sort of compensation. Maybe a free dessert or drinks or even a % off the bill.  Unsatisfactory, will not eat there again, they have lost our service for stays in the future.",Very Negative,deeply apologetic and committed to resolution,"I'm truly sorry to hear about your recent dining experience at our restaurant. It sounds like we fell short in several areas – the seasoning, cooking temperature, and serving speed. We value your feedback greatly and understand that these issues significantly impacted your meal enjoyment.
I'd also like to acknowledge the kindness shown by our team members despite the challenges faced during your visit. However, I agree that offering a form of compensation would have been appropriate given the circumstances. In the future, we aim to make things right when situations arise so that guests can continue to have enjoyable experiences here.
Rest assured, I have passed along this valuable information to our management team. They take your concerns seriously and will work diligently to improve upon our current standards to ensure a better culinary journey for all our valued guests. Thank you once again for taking the time to share your thoughts; your feedback helps us grow and serve you better.
Wishing you delicious meals ahead!"
"We ordered room service - which we rarely do.  When we checked out, we were surprised there was a $13.19 buffet charge on our $43.80 breakfast room service bill (for which we had a receipt).  Not sure if someone erroneously charged a buffet meal to our room or ???  It was corrected, but in the future we probably won't put our credit card on file for ""incidentals"" to avoid this.  Also, hoping the room we were in will get its table back.  Was awkward to eat without it.",Negative,apologetic and solution-focused,"I appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with us, especially regarding the unexpected charge on your room service bill during your recent stay. I apologize for any inconvenience that may have caused. Upon reviewing your case, it appears there was indeed an error made in the billing process. Rest assured, we've taken steps to ensure similar incidents don't happen again so you can enjoy a seamless dining experience when ordering from our room service.
Regarding the missing table in your room, I completely understand how it might have affected your dining experience. Our housekeeping team should already be aware of this issue; they will make sure to restore the table promptly so that your next visit is more comfortable. Thank you once again for bringing these matters to our attention, and please know that your satisfaction remains our top priority. We look forward to serving you better in the future!"
Disappointed that someone knocked on our door Christmas morning @ 8:06 am to clean room. We told them to come back. Then we also told the front desk attendant that we would like our room cleaned while we were out for a good 7 hours from 11AM to 6 PM. We came back to an unattended room.   We checked in on Sunday before Christmas  and left Wednesday after Christmas .,Negative,apologetic and solution-focused,"I'm truly sorry to hear about your unpleasant experience during your stay. It was unfortunate that you encountered housekeeping so early on Christmas morning. While it's essential to maintain a clean environment for all guests, we understand how important personal time can be, especially during holidays.
I have taken note of your request to have your room serviced between 11 AM and 6 PM. Our team will ensure they respect this preference moving forward. Unfortunately, there seems to have been a miscommunication or oversight regarding your specific needs on this occasion.
To make up for this inconvenience, we would like to offer a small gesture as an apology—perhaps a complimentary upgrade or a discount on future stays. Please let me know if this would help alleviate some of the disappointment caused by this incident. Once again, thank you for bringing this matter to our attention, and I hope you’ll consider giving us another chance to serve you better"
I was so happy you let dogs stay!  My dog is cleaner than my infant and think $100 per stay is still too much.,Neutral,balanced and professional,"Delighted to hear that you enjoyed bringing your furry friend along during your stay! We're glad we could make it comfortable for both of you. It's wonderful to know that your pet is well-behaved and even tidier than your little one (now that's impressive)!
Regarding the pet fee, while we understand the value our guests place on their pets, we do have costs associated with maintaining a pet-friendly environment. That being said, we will certainly take this into consideration when reviewing our policies in the future. Thank you once again for sharing your thoughts; they truly help us improve our services. Looking forward to welcoming you back soon!"
"Wonderful stay!  We stopped in the bar our first night and it was pretty dead in there (right before Christmas), but the bartender was awesome and we all watched Elf together :)
The room was great as usual, just like I remembered from my childhood, but updated!
We didn't have the breakfast there because it's a bit different than we remembered.  It's now an additional charge to the room and the set up is different.  I'm sure it's tasty but we opted out of it.",Very_Positive,professional and courteous,"Delighted to hear you enjoyed your recent stay! The bar experience sounds unique – kudos to our bartender who made the quiet evening more enjoyable by playing Elf with guests. Regarding the breakfast, apologies if it wasn't as expected; we appreciate your feedback about the change and will consider this when planning updates for future offerings. Thank you again for choosing us and hope to see you soon!"
I wasnâ€™t notified about $7 parking fee until check in. Couldnâ€™t find anything about it on website nor was the info provided when making the reservation. This is first experience Iâ€™ve had with any hotel where they werenâ€™t upfront about parking costs online and during reservation process.,Very Negative,deeply apologetic and committed to resolution,"We deeply apologize for this inconvenience. Upon reviewing our procedures, we realize there might have been an oversight regarding parking fees communication. Moving forward, we will ensure all necessary information is clearly stated on our website and communicated at the time of booking. Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention so we can improve your future stays with us."
"We specifically asked at check in what time breakfast was served and the desk person said 7 am to 10 am.  We got to the buffet at 9:30 the next morning and we're told it cloed at 9:30 and they would not serve us.  When I complained at checkout the girl at the desk said, ""I'm sorry about that.  Our breakfast is really good!"". Not pleased with the misinformation and the response I got.",Negative,apologetic and solution-focused,"I'm truly sorry for the inconvenience you experienced regarding our breakfast hours. The information provided at check-in didn't align with reality, which led to an unfortunate situation. To improve this, we will ensure all staff provide accurate details about meal times upon check-in. Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention. We value your experience and strive to make every stay memorable."
