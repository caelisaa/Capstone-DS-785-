"Couple of items, the temperature in our room, 832, would not warm up, it was around 67 deg the entire stay. The fan ran constantly and was fairly loud. I did not mention during our stay because I didn’t want the hassle of someone in and out of our room, and or having to change rooms. The next was a leak in the main roof outside of our room in the corner of the courtyard near room 832, water was dripping pretty fast. This did not effect us as it was outside our room but not a great look for the hotel. We did the buffet, the food was very mediocre, i thought the potatoes were cold and greasy. The omlettes and fruit were good. It took quite a while to get our bill even though it was it not overly crowded. if we stay here again we will not eat the buffet. As long as I am filling this out I will mention the parking, validating the parking all the time is a pain, can’t it somehow be piggyback with the room key.",Slightly Negative,understanding and mildly apologetic,"Dear Guest,

"The food in the restaurant was over salted, under cooked and some of it was cold. We waited for more than an hour to be served once our order was placed. The staff was nice and the manager came out and apologized but never once did he ever offer us any sort of compensation. Maybe a free dessert or drinks or even a % off the bill.  Unsatisfactory, will not eat there again, they have lost our service for stays in the future.",Negative,apologetic and solution-focused,"Dear Guest,
Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. I'm truly sorry to hear about the issues you encountered during your dining experience at our restaurant.

"We ordered room service - which we rarely do.  When we checked out, we were surprised there was a $13.19 buffet charge on our $43.80 breakfast room service bill (for which we had a receipt).  Not sure if someone erroneously charged a buffet meal to our room or ???  It was corrected, but in the future we probably won't put our credit card on file for ""incidentals"" to avoid this.  Also, hoping the room we were in will get its table back.  Was awkward to eat without it.",Very Positive,enthusiastic and grateful,"Dear Valued Guest,

Disappointed that someone knocked on our door Christmas morning @ 8:06 am to clean room. We told them to come back. Then we also told the front desk attendant that we would like our room cleaned while we were out for a good 7 hours from 11AM to 6 PM. We came back to an unattended room.

"Wonderful stay!  We stopped in the bar our first night and it was pretty dead in there (right before Christmas), but the bartender was awesome and we all watched Elf together :)
The room was great as usual, just like I remembered from my childhood, but updated!

We got to the buffet at 9:30 the next morning and we're told it cloed at 9:30 and they would not serve us.  When I complained at checkout the girl at the desk said, ""I'm sorry about that.

Because the elevators still have the old fashioned bell/ding when selecting the floor in the elevator and audible from the elevator lobby, I was constantly hearing it in my room as well.

Nice Hotel.  But the common area was loud.  Which was surprising since the hotel seemed empty.  Again no offer for an upgrade at this property for Globalist.  In fact my Bedroom TV wasn't even the typical large TV.  It was like a Computer Monitor.  Just surprised I never get an offer at this property.

Almost everything was great. The room was spacious and well appointed. The only issue we had was with the temperature. When we got to the room it was 72 degrees so I tried to turn it down to 65. After about a hour my husband looked at the thermostat and it was at 74 so it was going up instead of down. We called the front desk and were told that they would have to contact the engineers to turn the heat off to our room and they gave us a fan. I assumed that it would be taken care of the next day but no luck. Thankfully the fan was large and did the job while we were sleeping!,Positive but Critical,appreciative but attentive to concerns,"Thank you for your feedback!

"I am a huge fan of this hotel and have stayed here(GB Hyatt)  about 15 nights in the past 1 - 2 years. I am usually very impress overall, but this time was not my best experience. The hotel was not very busy and parking lot nearly empty for my entire stay. I was checked in to a room with construction going on right above me and I heard a lot of construction noise early and throughout the day as I was working.  There was also a blue crane that was extended right in front of my window.  Since there was hardly anyone in the hotel I was surprised they put me in this room. I didn't ask to be moved.  The carpet in my room was buckling and needs to be stretched.  The staff in the restaurant (breakfast) was also ignoring the guests as they stood at the front and talked.  I had to get up and ask for a menu, got to them to ask for water, then a refill and then go up and ask for my bill.  My eggs were also under cooked (ordered poached medium- no issue with them being under cooked, that happens and is not big deal) and I waited for someone to come and see how things were so I could reorder, but no one ever did (that was the issue-poor service). Each time I went up to ask for service the young ladies were very nice, but they clearly were more interested in talking to each other than in taking care of the guests. The person at the front desk (the one that checked me out for my stay) also needs to work on her customer service.  I saw her a few times during my stay and she never smiles, says hello or greets the guests, didn't ask how my stay was, etc  She was very cold and not very friendly and not typical of the Hyatt Staff I have net over the course of my stays.  I'm hoping this is not her usual demeanor and she was just ""off"".  
Like I said earlier, I am a huge fan of the hotel and am only sharing this for constructive purposes.  In general my hop is that the GB Hyatt is not slipping and that on my next stay the service will be improved. 

Thank you.",Positive but Critical,appreciative but attentive to concerns,"Thank you for your loyalty and valuable feedback. We sincerely apologize for the issues you experienced during your stay.
